GameStop stock halts trading after Reddit drama,https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244900/game-stop-stock-halted-trading-volatility,"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Kim Lyons
Trading in stock of video game retailer GameStop (GME) was halted briefly Friday, as it soared more than 70 percent, due partly to the enthusiastic support of a group of Reddit day traders. 
The stock is up more than 250 percent year to date, rising sharply last week after GameStop announced Chewy CEO Ryan Cohen was joining its board, CNBC reported. Short-seller Citron Research predicted the price would drop, but members of the Reddit board r/wallstreetbets, who had been generating interest in the stock, criticized Citron on the Reddit message board and continued praising the stock on social media. 
GameStop is the most-shorted stock in the market
The hype generated by r/wallstreetbets helped create what’s known as a “short squeeze” on GameStop’s stock. A short squeeze works like this: some investors, known as shorts, essentially bet that a company’s stock will fall. These investors borrow stock from other investors and sell it — with plans to buy it back when the prices fall and then return it to the original owner. However, the problem with shorting is that one’s losses are theoretically infinite; if a stock begins an upward run, some short sellers will abandon their short and buy shares at the higher price to return. This, in turn, makes the stock go higher, burning any other shorts who remain in the stock, some of whom may, in turn, choose to cover their own shorts. 
GameStop is the most-shorted stock in the market, CNBC said, citing FactSet. More than 138 percent of its shares are sold short — making it a prime target for a short squeeze. GameStop’s Reddit-related surge triggered a circuit breaker stoppage when it rose 69 percent (nice) on Friday around 12:45PM ET. 
Citron said Friday it would no longer comment on the GameStop stock because of “the angry mob who owns this stock.” Citron Research editor Andrew Left wrote in a note to readers that the backlash had included criminal activity he planned to report to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which included harassment of minor children as well as financial crimes. 
According to Bloomberg, the past 10 days has been the most volatile period in GameStop’s stock in its history. At the close of markets Friday, GameStop was up more than 50 percent from its Thursday close, with a market cap of $4.5 billion.

Robinhood denies claims that it sold GameStop shares out from under its traders,https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254857/robinhood-gamestop-amc-shares-sold-surprised-users,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Jacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he’s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk. 
No, Robinhood tells The Verge, it didn’t sell off full shares of GameStop, AMC, and other buzzy stocks without permission from its traders. 
That contradicts the stories of twelve people who spoke with The Verge, saying that the app unexpectedly sold off their holdings in some of these companies. Quite a number of Robinhood users expressed their surprise on social media today that the app was selling off their stakes, and we tracked down a dozen of them. These traders didn’t believe they had prompted the sales, and they said they weren’t aware of anything on their account that would have automatically triggered them. 
“I didn’t have any triggers to sell the stock whether it went up or down. I certainly wouldn’t have put it at $197 when it had just been almost $500,” Jett Flores, who said he was holding stock in GameStop and AMC through Robinhood, told The Verge.
The small traders planned to hold onto their stock, rather than sell
A spokesperson for Robinhood said these small sellers are wrong about how their shares were sold. “I can confirm that claims that Robinhood proactively sold customers’ shares outside of our standard margin-related sellouts or options assignment procedures are false,” the spokesperson told The Verge.
On Wednesday, Robinhood warned some investors with options in GameStop and AMC that it may automatically sell off their stakes to reduce risk, the spokesperson said. But these investors told The Verge they didn’t have options in GameStop or AMC and hadn’t purchased the stocks on margin. They had purchased the shares outright, they said, and were planning to hold onto them.
Margin orders occur when an investor borrows money from the broker (in this case Robinhood) to complete a sale, and brokers can call in those shares if they’re worried the investor can’t pay up. According to Robinhood, most of its actions have been calling in options to purchase shares — a more aggressive move, but not unprecedented. But if users fully owned their shares, as these traders claim they did, selling the holdings would be far more unusual.
The Verge saw screenshots from six traders indicating that their purchase of GameStop or AMC stock had been filled within Robinhood. Six traders sent screenshots showing that their stock in these companies had been sold, with four clearly indicating that they had been sold today. Another trader sent screenshots showing a purchase of Naked Brand stock being filled and then sold within the app. The screenshots don’t indicate how the purchases were funded or how the sales were initiated, but in several of them the app displays a message saying, “We’ve received your order to sell [#] shares of [stock] at the best available price.”
“I certainly wouldn’t have put it at $197 when it had just been almost $500.”
Traders who spoke with The Verge said they were disappointed to lose their stake in these companies. The traders had been planning to keep the stock for longer, and several said they certainly wouldn’t have sold it at the point that they believe Robinhood pushed through the transaction, as GameStop’s stock was faltering from a nearly $500 high.
“It’s extremely dishonest trade on their part and unacceptable,” Ian Q., who said Robinhood unexpectedly sold his shares in GameStop this morning, told The Verge.
The surprise selloff isn’t happening to everyone — plenty of people on the r/WallStreetBets subreddit (and one person I know, who told me they purchased GameStop stock days ago) say they weren’t impacted. And though traders may be outraged by the surprise, Robinhood’s terms of service grant it permission to close a trader’s position under a number of circumstances.
While r/WallStreetBets has been at the center of the frenzy around GameStop and AMC stocks, Robinhood has been the tool of choice for many of the small-time and brand new traders jumping in to take part. But this morning, Robinhood blocked new purchases of stock from GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Nokia, and others that were spiking in large part because of purchases coming through the app. The company is now facing widespread backlash from users, celebrities, and politicians, and it’s announced plans to re-open purchases on a “limited” basis on Friday.
It’s still not clear what happened to cause these users’ stakes to be sold off today. But at the very least, it means Robinhood has even more unhappy customers.

How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop,https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street,"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg. 
There are three things to remember as you watch the chaos unfolding with GameStop’s stock price. First, Wall Street is just what happens when you mix money with feelings. Second, the internet is real life. And third, the Street always wins, especially if you’re trading with Robinhood.
If you haven’t been paying attention, GameStop’s stock has been soaring in a remarkably volatile fashion; on January 22nd, GameStop zoomed upward 69 percent (nice) before it triggered a circuit breaker halt. The following Monday, January 25th, GameStop trading was halted nine times.
The idea was to punish short-sellers, and for the little guys to pummel Wall Street
On the surface, this doesn’t make sense. GameStop, founded a year before Blockbuster, is part of a dwindling cohort of IRL businesses that are being starved by online marketplaces. These days, you can just buy video games over the internet instead of going to a soul-killing strip mall in Iowa City to buy a physical copy of the game. GameStop’s business has been suffering as a result.
Currently, many people are at home and bored, and consequently, interest in day trading has shot through the roof. There is a Reddit forum for this, r/WallStreetBets, which describes itself as being “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal.” A year ago, a user called delaneydi argued that GameStop was underpriced by the market. For a while, the idea that r/WallStreetBets would take over GameStop was a joke — but then it turned serious, Bloomberg reported. The idea was to punish short-sellers, and for the little guys to pummel Wall Street.
If you think GameStop will fail and the stock will go down, or even that the company will go bankrupt, there’s a way to make money on that. Typically, this is done by short selling — a practice where you borrow shares for a fee and sell them for (ideally) a high price, then buy them back at (ideally) a lower price to return them. This can make you a lot of money, especially if the company goes bankrupt and you don’t have to return the stock!
The thing about short selling, though, is that you lose money if the stock goes up, and your losses are potentially infinite if the stock keeps going up. There are several other bad things that can also happen, such as an increase in fees or the original investor wanting their stock back. This means some shorts will be forced to “cover,” or buy the stock back at a high price, which sends the price even higher.
For retail investors, this process has gotten easier and cheaper
Right now, more people are betting against GameStop than betting it will succeed. “Short interest is 71.2 million shares, while GameStop has only 69.7 million shares outstanding,” Matt Levine of Bloomberg points out. Some people will notice that kind of thing and think, Hm, this stock is prime for a short squeeze! Basically, because so many people are short, it may be possible to trigger a chain reaction where you buy enough stock to send the price up, forcing some shorts to cover, sending the price up further, forcing more shorts to cover, and so on. 
For retail investors, this process has gotten easier and cheaper because of apps such as Robinhood. In addition to letting you buy and sell stock, you can easily buy an option for stock, instead of the stock itself. If you are feeling confident in a stock, you can buy a call option — which lets you buy a stock at a specific price on a specific date.
Let’s say my fake investing firm wants to buy a call option on Company X. Currently, shares of Company X are trading at $10. I feel confident in Company X, so I buy options that let me buy 100 shares of Company X stock for $25 a share on March 1st. This contract is usually cheaper than the share price.
So let’s say Company X goes on an epic run in February, and by February 15th, it’s up to $50 a share. I can sell my options for more than I paid for them, if I want. Or I can continue to hold onto them until March 1st, when I take delivery of the 100 shares, which are now trading at $55 a share, and immediately sell them. As a result, I make a profit of $30 per share, minus whatever fees I paid for the options.
Stocks are memes now, and you trade them to show off to your friends
On the other hand, maybe I bet badly and Company X only gets up to $20. In that case, my losses are limited to whatever fees I paid for my options — I just never buy the shares. This makes options a riskier bet than just buying Company X stock directly, because I might just lose all the money I spent on the options, instead of at least getting to own the stock. But it means there’s a lot more upside as well, because I didn’t have to spend all the money on the stock upfront. If risk is your idea of fun, options are great!
Now, someone has to be on the other end of my trade. The outfit that sold me the options is going to try to reduce the risk that my options will hurt them, and they will do this by buying stock in Company X. That makes the stock go up, and the further up the stock goes, the more stock my counterparty will have to buy. 
Options were once a fairly sophisticated thing to trade — something ordinary people didn’t really do. But Robinhood makes the option trades easy and free. Plus, there’s a social aspect to the trades — which is where r/WallStreetBets come in. Stocks are memes now, and you trade them to show off to your friends.
Day traders, such as the ones on r/WallStreetBets, are typically held in contempt by professional traders, and they are acutely aware of this. The professional short-sellers who created the possibility of a short squeeze underestimated the day traders’ sophistication, and r/WallStreetBets pounced. Time to troll Wall Street out of a fuckload of money! 
GameStop’s short-sellers have been trolled out of about $5 billion in 2021
The fine people of r/WallStreetBets decided GameStop was undervalued, and the stock would go up, so they put up a bunch of posts about how they were buying GameStop options. This drove up the stock price for GameStop, as their counterparties had to load up on stock to balance, and then more stock as more people bought options and so on. The soaring stock meant some shorts had to cover, sending the stock up further. As of January 26th, short-sellers have been trolled out of about $5 billion in 2021, just from their GameStop positions alone.
What does Robinhood have to do with this? Well, it makes options trading much more accessible to retail investors — but there’s something else. Trades on Robinhood are free! But Robinhood isn’t offering free trades to be nice; the company gets paid by some big-time investors such as Citadel Securities to see what retail investors are doing. This phenomenon, which other brokerages are engaged in as well, is called payment for order flow. Citadel Securities makes its money on these orders by “automatically taking the other side of the order, then returning to the market to flip the trade. It pockets the difference between the price to buy and sell, known as the spread,” according to the Financial Times.
The argument in favor of this practice is, essentially, retail investors get better prices than they would on the open market, Bloomberg’s Levine writes. The practice is controversial, though, because some critics say it harms investors. It’s theoretically possible to “‘front run’ orders by, for example, jumping ahead of a customer’s stock purchase to buy it themselves, making a small gain if the share price increases,” the Financial Times explains. “There is no suggestion that Citadel Securities engages in such activity, which is prohibited by SEC.” 
Robinhood got in trouble with the SEC for “misleading statements and omissions” about how it made its money by selling the orders its traders made to other firms. According to the SEC, Robinhood investors got second-rate prices, which cost them a collective $34.1 million. The company paid a $65 million fine in December to settle charges, and the practices the SEC objected to “do not reflect Robinhood today,” Dan Gallagher, the brokerage’s chief legal officer, told Business Insider.
Wall Street can also get in on screwing Wall Street
When asked for comment, Robinhood referred to an op-ed published by Vlad Tenev, the company’s CEO and co-founder. The company says its customers are mostly “buy and hold”  investors, not reckless ones. The op-ed said nothing about payment for order flow, and Robinhood declined to comment on the practice in a follow-up email.
Citadel Securities is winning on this, though! Last June, the company was responsible for 40 percent of shares traded by retail investors, the Financial Times wrote, citing Piper Sandler. It doesn’t just get Robinhood’s orders either — TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab also work with Citadel Securities. “Not only are retail market makers getting increased trading volume, they are likely getting increased profitability per trade,” Tyler Gellasch, executive director of Healthy Markets Association, told the FT.
Which means that Wall Street can also get in on screwing Wall Street. And it’s not just Citadel Securities. I’d be very surprised if high-frequency trading algorithms weren’t also getting in on the fun. Plus, Chamath Palihapitiya, the Silicon Valley SPAC icon, has decided to yolo along with the Redditors. (“Yolo” as a verb appears to be part of the r/WallStreetBets peculiar parlance.) Elon Musk, a man who notoriously hates short-sellers, is also observing the chaos.
At least one Wall Street firm has taken heavy losses — Melvin Capital Management, which was shorting GameStop, among other bets. It’s been bailed out by Citadel, which, confusingly, is not the same thing as Citadel Securities. (Citadel is a hedge fund, not a market maker.) Both firms were founded by the same guy, though: Ken Griffin. And by bailing out Melvin, Griffin got “a rare opportunity to invest in a talented manager on the cheap,” according to Bloomberg.
What does this have to do with GameStop itself? Absolutely nothing — this is a weird game now. And the market’s frothy, too; in July, I joined Robinhood to see how it works. The Verge’s ethics policy forbids us from directly trading stock in companies we cover, so for research purposes I picked six stocks that belong to companies I don’t cover because their earnings were next on the calendar. (I actually don’t know what several of them do.) I am a buy-and-hold investor because I am a bore, but as of today I’m a bore who’s up 30 percent. One more time: I know nothing about these companies except that I won’t have to write about them. It’s easy to feel like a genius in a bull market, and a lot of first-time day traders are probably very bullish on their investing sense right now.
At this point you may be wondering whether what r/WallStreetBets is doing is illegal — after all, it’s a group of people trying to artificially drive up a stock price in order to sell for outsized profits. And the answer is: well, maybe? It definitely seems like a pump-and-dump scheme, but — this part is crucial — no one’s lying, as Bloomberg’s Levine points out. Theoretically, the SEC could chase down the r/WallStreetBets investors, since no one’s really anonymous on the internet, but this seems like a lot of effort for what is not actually a slam-dunk case. It is “an enforcement nightmare,” James Cox, a professor at Duke University School of Law, tells Bloomberg.
it’s not just GameStop anymore
Also, GameStop’s shorts seem undeterred — as some older shorts are getting out of the market, they’re being replaced by new ones. Perhaps this is because they are anticipating the “dump” portion of the pump-and-dump scheme; perhaps this is because they’re awaiting quarterly earnings, which usually tanks GameStop’s stock. Maybe they’re just having fun, too!
But: it’s not just GameStop anymore. r/WallStreetBets is yoloing its way into electric carmaker Nio, OG tech company Blackberry, and AMC, the movie theater chain. And if those day traders are doing it, then the market makers that buy the order flow from Robinhood are yoloing along for the ride. And one thing is clear: what Citadel Securities is doing is legal.
So what happens next? I don’t know — but I suspect that someone on Wall Street will find a way to make money on it.

"Google salvaged Robinhood’s one-star rating by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews",https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Jay Peters, a news editor who writes about technology, video games, and virtual worlds. He’s submitted several accepted emoji proposals to the Unicode Consortium.

Google is actively removing negative reviews of the Robinhood app from the Google Play Store, the company confirmed to The Verge. After some disgruntled Robinhood users organized campaigns to give the app a one-star review on Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store — and succeeded in review-bombing it all the way down to a one-star rating — the company has now deleted enough reviews to bring it back up to nearly four stars.
Robinhood came under intense scrutiny on Thursday, after the stock trading app announced it would block purchases of GameStop, AMC, and other stocks made popular by the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, and some users have already replaced their deleted one-star reviews with new ones to make their anger heard.
Here’s a screenshot from the Play Store page captured by 9to5Google when the app had a one-star rating and nearly 275,000 reviews:
And here’s a screenshot we took shortly before publishing this article, showing a nearly four-star rating and around 180,000 reviews.
It’s not outside Google’s purview to delete these posts. Google’s policies explicitly prohibit reviews intended to manipulate an app’s rating, and the company says it has a system that “combines human intelligence with machine learning to detect and enforce policy violations in ratings and reviews.” Google says it specifically took action on reviews that it felt confident violated those policies, the company tells The Verge. Google says companies do not have the ability to delete reviews themselves. 
On Apple’s App Store, Robinhood has a 4.7 rating, and we didn’t see any reviews newer than Wednesday. However, popular apps like TikTok, Uno, and Genshin Impact also didn’t have reviews from any later than Wednesday when we checked.
Unhappy Robinhood users aren’t just using reviews to show their ire — they’re also calling for a class action lawsuit. Later on Thursday, Robinhood said it would allow “limited buys” of certain stocks on Friday. The company said that halting purchases on Thursday was “a risk-management decision.”

"Discord has turned into a virtual trade floor with memes, stonks, and chaos",https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012.
A real-life trading floor is noisy. You can find traders shouting at each other, especially when the markets are volatile and stock is moving fast. That same environment has been replicated online this week, thanks to Discord. 
Getting inside offers a surreal look at an emerging virtual trade floor where people are yelling at each other to invest into GameStop or AMC stocks. Dozens of people join the server every second, and one channel has a stream of memes that looks like pure chaos. 
Welcome to the world of r/WallStreetBets.
Discord is usually the tool of choice for gamers to communicate with friends, Twitch streamers to grow a community, or just small groups of people to share similar interests. It’s a hugely popular app, with more than 100 million monthly active users. The Reddit community r/WallStreetBets has turned to Discord in recent weeks to organize and communicate in real time, as it seeks to force hedge funds into losing millions of dollars on their bets against struggling retail companies like GameStop and AMC.
Amateur traders are flocking to the Discord server to discuss stock movements, share memes, and participate in what feels like an online game. Every post is littered with emoji reactions that fly off the page within seconds, and the calls are full of people shouting “buy GameStop” or “hold GMC” as stock prices go up and down throughout the day.
At times it feels like it only takes one person to shout something on a call or spam a meme enough times for it to catch on and everyone to run with it. I witnessed hundreds of people hit Twitch yesterday to spam “save AMC” in a variety of live streams. Rapper Soulja Boy’s Twitch stream was swarmed with the messages, after calls to visit his stream. But the group failed to convince him to tweet about the struggling theater chain. 
The Discord calls and many of the memes are often full of profanity or racial slurs, leading Discord to ban the r/WallStreetBets server last night. It quickly came back to life a few hours later, though, and has already amassed 200,000 members.
“Can we just get one minute of therapeutic silence,” asked someone on the main Discord call yesterday. A few seconds of silence passed before the ask was met with fart sounds, high-pitched music, and sound boards. The members often joke about the FBI or SEC listening in, which prompts many to spam the “FBI, open up!” audio meme. 
After last night’s Discord server ban, r/WallStreetBets is rebuilding its Discord community, but a split has emerged. There are now two Discord servers, with an unofficial one at 88,000 members.
Misinformation is common throughout these Discord servers. In the official one, a discussion broke out about the potential for a US-led war to impact stock markets. “There is going to be a war, 100 percent,” claimed one Discord user. “I’m going to bring my gaming chair into the war,” joked another. Fake Elon Musk memes are also as popular as the man himself among this group. “The only thing I want in life is for Elon Musk to tell me I’m beautiful,” said one Discord user praising the Tesla CEO.
Among all the chaos and fake Elon Musk memes, there is some relative organization on the server with calmer heads providing tips to amateur traders. “Only put money in that you can afford to lose,” is a common piece of advice. New members often join and want to know what stock to invest in, but are quickly met with “we are not financial advisors” or “buy what you feel like buying” responses.
I’ve also witnessed what sound like day traders teaching people the basics of options, market retracements, and how to create charts with technical indicators and overlays. Robinhood has made buying and selling stocks as easy as posting a photo to Instagram, and those new to this experiment are eager to learn more.
Others, who have clearly been part of the r/WallStreetBets community for more than a few days, are also quick to advise new members not to try trial broker accounts with fake money for too long. “You need to get used to the emotional reality of a market open,” said one Discord member.
The advice is often interrupted by excitement as GameStop or AMC shares reach new highs. At one point this morning GameStop hit $420 a share in premarket trading, which was met by cheers and surprise on the Discord call.
I personally spend large parts of my day on Discord, but I’ve still never seen anything quite like the r/WallStreetBets server — even in groups with 300,000 members. Dozens of people join every second, and at times it has forced Discord to crash on my high-end gaming PC or take up lots of CPU resources. Even on my iPhone it kills my battery and makes my phone hot to touch.
The question now is how long this mass organized movement can continue on Discord, and the amount of time left in the grand GameStop stock price game. After a ban for “hateful and discriminatory content,” the official r/WallStreetBets Discord server seems less chaotic. But r/WallStreetBets describes itself as “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal,” and a lot of the Reddit comments contain offensive language.
r/WallStreetBets feels like The Button, an online meta-game that first appeared on Reddit for April Fools’ Day in 2015. Redditors rushed to push a button on a 60-second timer that would reset every time it was clicked. It inspired devotion and obsession much like this GameStop stock rally, and even spawned religions and cults.
The Button ended more than two months after its introduction when the timer finally hit zero with no attempts to reset it. There’s no timer here on this Discord and Reddit trade floor experiment, and nobody really knows exactly how and when it’s going to end.

"After buy ban, GameStop hypebeasts are looking for a Robinhood alternative",https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254168/robinhood-gamestop-ban-amc-nokia-public-webull-ameritrade-stock-buy-trade,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Julia Alexander
In the wake of Robinhood’s surprise trading block, a new class of Reddit investors are looking for apps that will let them plow their money into their favorite stocks. On Thursday morning, Robinhood announced it would temporarily block investors from purchasing or trading companies including GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, Bed Bath & Beyond, and Nokia, all of which have been the subject of unexpected rallies over the past few days. 
For the online communities that fueled those rallies, the block was treated as an outright betrayal at the time of the initial ban. Discussion about switching ramped up on Twitter and in investment discords after Robinhood halted buying and trading on stock, citing “recent volatility” in the market with the aforementioned stock as the reason it prevented additional trading. 
Since the decision, Robinhood’s app on the App Store has received thousands of one-star reviews as a form of practice known as review bombing. On the r/WallStreetBets subreddit, angry Robinhood users are calling for a class action lawsuit because “allowing people to only sell is the definition of market manipulation,” according to one post. There’s even a new subreddit specifically for suing the company. Another Robinhood user tweeted that after years of being on the platform, the move felt like a “slap to the face,” adding “to be regulated in a time of absolute prime opportunities is an embarrassment.” 
On Twitter, beloved rapper and Fyre Fest promoter Ja Rule did not mince words: “Yo this is a fucking CRIME what @RobinhoodApp is doin.”
Robinhood has been central to much of the chaos within the financial sector over the last few days. Investors from r/WallStreetBets or its private Discord server used the personal finance app to inflate GameStop and other stocks as a blow against Wall Street hedge funds. Late Thursday afternoon, Robinhood issued a statement informing users the company would allow “limited buys of these securities,” beginning Friday. The statement says Robinhood will “continue to monitor the situation and may make adjustments as needed.” The Verge has reached out to Robinhood to determine what “limited buys” means for investors. 
“To be clear, this was a risk-management decision, and was not made on the direction of the market makers we route to,” the company says. “We’re beginning to open up trading for some of these securities in a responsible manner.”
In the statement, Robinhood’s team specifically noted that the company stands “in support of our customers and the freedom of retail investors to shape their own financial future,” adding that “democratizing finance has been our guiding star since our earliest days.” But when Robinhood took steps to stem the rally, the r/WallStreetBets community felt betrayed — and began looking for alternatives.
“Yo this is a fucking CRIME what @RobinhoodApp is doin”
The list of brokerages that have stopped allowing trades and buys of the aforementioned stock fluctuated throughout the day: Robinhood and Interactive Brokers have halted trading. TD Ameritrade has placed “restrictions on some transactions in $GME and other securities,” a spokesperson told The Verge. Those restrictions “may include actions like increasing margin requirements, or limiting certain types of transactions, like short sales and those that may involve unlimited risk,” the spokesperson added. 
After initial publication, Public, an app similar to Robinhood, briefly stopped its users from trading and buying certain stock. The company issued a statement on Twitter, noting, “Our clearing firm, Apex Holdings, has decided to halt the buying of $KOSS, $GME, and $AMC.”
“We disagree with this decision and are working hard for our members to resolve the issue,” the statement continues. “We’ll provide updates here as they happen.”
Around 2:45pm ET on Thursday, Public allowed its users to purchase stock again from companies like AMC and GameStop. WeBull, which temporarily restricted trades on stock from companies like GameStop and AMC, lifted those restrictions around 2:40pm ET on Thursday. 
For Robinhood competitors like Public, it’s a golden opportunity. In fact, Public even doubled the free stock slice for member referrals. Popular YouTube personality Casey Neistat tweeted on Thursday morning just after the Robinhood halting began that “everyone complaining about @RobinhoodApp delisting GameStop and I’m over here on @public about to get Bill Gates rich.” He later said that no one should take investment advice from him and that he’s an investor in Public. 
“Also im an investor in public and i hope this ridiculous behavior from Robinhood brings attention to superior companies (like Public),” Neistat tweeted. 
Switching to a competitor will still add some friction — and might cost investors valuable time in an exceptionally volatile situation. When creating an account on Public, for instance people may have to wait a few days for their application to be approved, according to a message that appears during the signup process. If people are trying to get in on GameStop and AMC while the magic rally is still in effect, that delay might defeat the purpose — although at least one Verge reporter had their account approved in the same day. 
“You’d think with a brand name like Robinhood you’d be all about the working class outsmarting the rich”
Most apps also allow investors to transfer their portfolios from other brokerages, including Robinhood, which could be faster. But there’s still likely to be a significant delay.
Webull is another investment app, and the FAQ states that “in most cases, account application is approved automatically.” Webull’s website also states that people can trade in the same day if “you deposit via ACH before 4:00 pm on a trading day” — basically, if funds are transferred from something like a bank to Webull. The site also states, however, that people “will get a provisional credit (up to $1000 depending on the incoming deposit) of buying power after your deposit,” which gives people “provisional buying power to trade.” 
Transferring stocks from one app to another, or flocking to another app to buy stocks, seems tedious — but as long as it’s unclear when Robinhood and other brokerages will allow purchases, GameStop’s new stockholders are left with no other choice. At the time of publication, GameStop’s stock was sitting at $155 — down from yesterday’s high of $468, but still more than triple where the stock was last week. 
“You’d think with a brand name like Robinhood you’d be all about the working class outsmarting the rich,” popular YouTube creator Ricky “FaZe Banks” Bengston tweeted. “You guys fkn blew it.”
Update January 28th, 1:37PM ET: The story has been updated to note that Public stopped allowing users to buy and trade certain stock. 
Update 2, January 28th, 2:45pm ET: The story has been updated to note that WeBull has removed restrictions on trading. 
Update 3, January 28th, 2:56pm ET: The story has been updated to note that Public has removed restrictions on certain stocks, allowing people to buy them once more. 
Update 4, January 28th, 4:50pm ET: The story has been updated to include new information that Robinhood will allow limited trading on certain securities beginning on Friday.
Correction January 28th, 1:45PM ET: An earlier version of this story said that TD Ameritrade halted purchases of certain stock. TD Ameritrade still allows stock to be bought, but there are restrictions in place, like increasing margin requirements. The Verge regrets the error.

How many stocks will Robinhood let you buy? The numbers keep shrinking,https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys,"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Mitchell Clark
If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.
Robinhood only wants users to have a limited number of shares of companies like GameStop, and that number keeps getting smaller and smaller. On Thursday, the company halted users’ ability to buy stocks that were associated with r/WallStreetBets, including GameStop, AMC, and Nokia, but the company promised that users would be able to buy limited quantities on Friday. Today, it released a shifting support document that details just how limited things are — and to slightly paraphrase Lando, the deal’s getting worse all the time.
When trading opened earlier today, users were limited to owning five shares of GameStop in aggregate, meaning they could only own up to five — if they already had three GameStop stocks, they could only buy two more — but even that restriction hasn’t lasted. Soon, the number of shares you could buy in GME dropped to two and then finally down to a single share. That’s right: you couldn’t buy more than one.
As the day went on, and the markets closed, the number of restricted stocks kept increasing, from 13 to 23 to over 50 at the time you read these words.
Here’s the latest set of restrictions, according to Robinhood’s support page:
Included in the update are Starbucks, Beyond Meat, and General Motors. There are no longer any companies on the list that you can buy more than five shares for.
Here’s the version of the chart we originally published:
And here’s what it looked like even earlier today:
While GameStop is the most (in)famous of the Wall Street bets, it’s not the only one, and Robinhood has been expanding the list of which companies are limited throughout the day. One of the stocks added is AMD, which is currently limited to just a single stock as well. 
Robinhood is also limiting the options contracts you can get for certain companies. To put it extraordinarily simply: buying an options contract doesn’t mean that you actually own the stock. It allows the owner of the contract to buy or sell the stock later on at an agreed-upon price. 
For example, if GameStop is at $343 a share now, and I thought it was going to go up, I could purchase a call option to buy it at $400. If the stock went over $400, I could then make money by using my option to buy that stock, now worth more, for $400. However, those contracts expire, and if the stock price doesn’t rise as high as I expected, I may lose money, which is a situation many hedge funds are finding themselves in. (As always, this isn’t financial advice, and I’m not a financial adviser. This is just an explainer of the mechanics using arbitrary numbers.) 
If you buy an option, Robinhood could also theoretically sell it out from under you under certain conditions, something it’s warned it would do.
In a blog post, Robinhood attempted to justify the decision to halt and then limit trading, but, like the limited stocks, users aren’t buying it. The app was review-bombed on Thursday, with many users leaving one-star reviews, complaining that the company wasn’t living up to its goal of “democratizing finance.” 
A Robinhood spokesperson pointed The Verge to the aforementioned blog post, saying that the company has been clear with customers that it would be monitoring the situation and making adjustments “as needed,” and that the limits have been labeled as subject to change.
Update January 29th, 5:39PM ET: Added news of the new stocks and restrictions Robinhood has added to the list.

Discord is no longer banning r/WallStreetBets — it’s helping them,https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254339/discord-r-wallstreetbets-server-help-moderation-ban,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012.
Discord is now helping the r/WallStreetBets team moderate its new server. The company originally banned the group yesterday due to “hateful and discriminatory content” and revealed it had sent repeated warnings to the team managing the community. 
Those warnings, for whatever reason, were ignored, but now the r/WallStreetBets team and Discord are working together. Discord staff are actively working with the server’s team to help with moderation. At least one Discord staffer, who is now in the new WallStreetBets server, is also helping with infrastructure problems related to the rapid growth the community is experiencing.
“WallStreetBets members have set up a new server and we are working with them,” says a Discord spokesperson in a statement to The Verge. “We will welcome the group back so long as they improve their moderation practices and follow our Community Guidelines. We have reached out to the moderators to provide them with support and advice, like we do for many of our large communities.”
Discord was left in an awkward position yesterday, after the largely unmoderated server suddenly grew in size and got out of control. It could either let hate speech continue in a community it wouldn’t normally ban or act to shut it down after repeated warnings. The ban appears to have worked to get the r/WallStreetBets moderators to respond.
Hours after the ban, the moderators of the subreddit criticized Discord publicly. “We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don’t get to hang out with your friends anymore,” said the r/WallStreetBets subreddit moderators.
The new WallStreetBets Discord server currently has 296,000 members, and it continues to grow every second. It has played a central role in the subreddit’s ongoing mission to drive up the price of GameStop and AMC stock. We’ve been following the Discord server growth over the past few days, and while it was full of profanity and racial slurs yesterday, whatever work Discord is doing behind the scenes appears to be working to reduce that content today.
There are now fewer people screaming in calls, using racial slurs, or blasting music to the hundreds listening in. The memes are now mainly emoji and text, rather than images that often included offensive material.
We’ve asked Discord exactly what is being done to improve moderation for text-, image-, and audio-based communications and how the company was able to resolve its differences with the WallStreetBets. The company wasn’t able to provide details at the time of publication.

Robinhood restricts crypto trading as Dogecoin soars 300 percent,https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255955/robinhood-cryptocurrency-restrictions-dogecoin-wallstreetbets,"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Tom Warren, a senior editor covering Microsoft, PC gaming, console, and tech. He founded WinRumors, a site dedicated to Microsoft news, before joining The Verge in 2012.
Robinhood has started restricting trading in cryptocurrencies this morning, just as the price of joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin has soared more than 300 percent in 24 hours. CNBC reports that Robinhood users started noticing instant deposits for cryptocurrencies were no longer working on Friday morning, and the company has confirmed it has put restrictions in place.
“Due to extraordinary market conditions, we’ve temporarily turned off Instant buying power for crypto,” says a Robinhood spokesperson in a statement to CNBC. “Customers can still use settled funds to buy crypto. We’ll keep monitoring market conditions and communicating with our customers.”
Dogecoin came to life in 2013 off the back of a Twitter joke — a play on bitcoin and the doge meme. Its price started soaring yesterday, and Dogecoin currently stands at a more than $7 billion market cap thanks to a huge volume of transactions over the past 24 hours.
The market activity and restrictions over the past 24 hours have now made Dogecoin a popular meme among the r/WallStreetBets investors. Dogecoin has been consistently spammed in the WallStreetBets Discord server over the past couple of days.
Bitcoin is also on the move, up nearly 20 percent over the past 24 hours. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also changed his Twitter profile to include #bitcoin and tweeted “in retrospect, it was inevitable.”
Robinhood’s latest crypto restrictions come less than a day after the company moved to restrict its users from buying or trading any of the popular Reddit r/WallStreetBets stocks, including GameStop ($GME), AMC ($AMC), BlackBerry ($BB), Bed Bath & Beyond ($BBBY), Nokia ($NOK), and more.
It’s a move that has been met with widespread criticism, and Google was forced to salvage Robinhood’s one-star rating on the Google Play Store by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews after unhappy users review-bombed the app. Robinhood says it will now allow “limited buys” of stocks like GameStop starting Friday.

Trading app Robinhood is in better shape than it looks,https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287381/robinhood-citadel-financial-services-house-day-traders,"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg. 
So here we are: about to have a hearing about GameStonk. Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is going to have to explain himself tomorrow. What happens next for Robinhood?
Perhaps you recall last month, when GameStop stock shot up by as much as 500 percent, hitting a peak of $483 on January 28th, thanks largely to memes and a shitposting finance subreddit. (I’m sure there will be entire academic books written on r/WallStreetBets. There is a paper already.) Many of the retail traders involved in the GameStop buying frenzy were using Robinhood, and the company became part of the meme — even though it had to limit trades on GameStop. The run-up had a populist theme: the little guys were gonna show the hedge funds; they were gonna make those dang short-sellers pay. The GameStop meme was a ton of free publicity for Robinhood, though the public outcry about limited trades means the House of Representatives is now inquiring.
This will be fun political theater, but it’s unlikely to have any kind of serious outcome
The House Financial Services Committee is going to have a hearing! This will be fun political theater, but it’s unlikely to have any kind of serious outcome. That’s probably why Robinhood is still planning to go public this year. Robinhood topped Apple’s mobile app store for days, and more than half a million people downloaded it, CNBC reports.
“They actually have an incredible opportunity with new users right now,” said Catherine Lamberton, a professor of marketing at the University of Pennsylvania’s business school, Wharton. The GameStonk saga is actually evidence that Robinhood has changed power dynamics in the market, she said. “They have an opportunity to keep growing with this.”
Sure, Robinhood limited GameStop trading near the peak, enraging some of its customers. But in March 2020, during the pandemic-related market crash, you may recall Robinhood had three major outages in a little more than a week. In some ways, this makes sense: Robinhood is a startup, and it was having a painful growth moment. At the time, Tenev and his co-CEO Baiju Bhatt chalked that failure up to “stress on our infrastructure.” They hadn’t predicted an event of that scale — and hadn’t planned for it. 
If this had been Twitter, there would have been a fail whale
Of course, the more famous service outage didn’t happen until January 2021, but the basic contours are the same. Robinhood hadn’t planned for an event of that scale, and when the clearinghouses raised their cash requirements, whoopsies! If this had been Twitter, there would have been a fail whale. People get mad enough when social media networks go down — but this is money. Even so, what happened last March, and again around GameStop, fit into a larger pattern of tech startup behavior.
“This is a normal startup thing,” said Lana Swartz, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia and author of New Money: How Payment Became Social Media. Essentially, the move is to bring a platform to market, get it to scale, and worry about everything else later.
A lack of customer service is expected in social media companies, Swartz said. “But as Silicon Valley companies are trying to take over more and more parts of our life, that modus operandi — ‘Sorry, we don’t work now and you signed the terms of service, so it’s on you! You consented to this!’ — that way of doing things isn’t going to cut it,” Swartz said. That’s why the most interesting questions at the hearing are likely to be about the terms of service agreement, not hedge funds, short-sellers, or payment for order flow.
“This isn’t an area where one can dabble.”
The question here is what small investors were led to believe and what actually happened, said Anat Admati, a professor of finance and economics at the Stanford School of Business. Robinhood does say in its terms of service that it can decline trades — but how many of its users read the terms of service? “The broader issue is that we agree to all kinds of things online,” Admati said in a telephone interview.
What’s more, with complex financial transactions, “we’ll work out the details later” is difficult to pull off, Lamberton said. “This isn’t an area where one can dabble,” she said. Lamberton wants to know how Robinhood might handle a similar mass retail event in the future: is it its goal to never let the GameStop situation happen again? Or would it instead figure out how to let mass retail events occur without its own internal system capsizing? “That decision will change their platform and also how they fit with Wall Street,” she says.
There are a lot of free things online, and the question is always how they make money, Admati said. In Robinhood’s case, that will be one of the subjects House politicians are likely to dive into — a controversial practice called “payment for order flow.” This allows market makers to bundle trades and make money through arbitrage. It could also theoretically let banks front-run retail investors, a practice which is illegal. Also, as Bloomberg’s Matt Levine notes: “The wholesaler is ordinarily filling your order at a price that is better than what’s available in the public market, so ‘front-running’ — going out and buying on the stock exchange and then turning around and selling to you at a profit — doesn’t work.”
Robinhood makes money when people make more trades
The guest list suggests this is where we will focus. There is, first of all, Citadel Securities, which does payment for order flow for brokerages that include Robinhood. There is Melvin Capital, a hedge fund that was fabulously successful last year and had to be bailed out this year due in part to its GameStop short positions. Citadel, a hedge fund, bought a stake. To make matters more confusing, Citadel and Citadel Securities are not the same thing, though they were founded by the same guy, Ken Griffin. 
The thing about payment for order flow is that Robinhood makes money when people make more trades. The company sends push notifications about positions you own, and you can set up custom price targets if you like to receive more. This is only a problem for Robinhood’s users; in general, day traders mostly don’t make money. 
This is particularly true for Robinhood, actually! During “herding events” like GameStonk, when Robinhood traders crowd into a stock, “large increases in Robinhood users are often accompanied by large price spikes and are followed by reliably negative returns,” the authors of a study on Robinhood users write. Another paper views Robinhood traders as, essentially, noise.
Focusing on a hedge fund conspiracy is missing the point. Robinhood and Citadel Securities make money when people trade. It is reasonable to ask whether to limit push notifications that might prompt people to impulse-trade.
I hope Gill wears his formal headband
We will also hear from the Reddit representatives, CEO Steve Huffman and r/WallStreetBets user Keith “DeepFuckingValue” Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty on YouTube. I imagine this will be about day trading, and someone will have to explain r/WallStreetBets, which: good luck! I hope Gill wears his formal headband.
It’s possible Tenev will have a disastrous performance, setting Robinhood up for a world of hurt. But the questions focused on payment for order flow, hedge funds, and whether short-sellers are evil (they aren’t!) will miss the Silicon Valley thing. Part of the problem was the terms of service agreement itself — no one reads them. Robinhood absolutely had the right to restrict trades, and furthermore, Robinhood is not liable for service failures regardless of cause, including those caused by software malfunctions. There is also an arbitration clause. 
What I’m getting at here is that Robinhood doesn’t have to change anything. It’s scaling rapidly. Users have agreed it can have whoopsies whenever it likes. Robinhood makes money regardless of whether its users do. Disputes go to arbitration, not court. Investors are piling in. If Tenev can ride out this hearing (and perhaps a similar one from the Senate), he’s in an excellent position for an IPO. All he has to do is let the politicians get their soundbites and not say anything horrible, and he wins.
Robinhood ran a Super Bowl ad celebrating its customers. If that’s not confidence, I’m not sure what is.

Nintendo’s new Mario-themed Switch is available now,https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22278494/nintendo-switch-mario-release-date-where-to-buy-amazon-best-buy-gamestop,"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Taylor Lyles

Alongside the release of Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury for the Nintendo Switch, several retailers have a Mario Red & Blue Edition Switch game console available for purchase. You can buy one right now at Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, and Target, while supplies last. 
Similar to the Animal Crossing: New Horizons-themed Switch released last year, this limited-edition console stands out from other models, with the entire Switch and its accompanying accessories based on the outfit typically worn by the mustached plumber. Retailing for $300, the limited-edition Switch features an all-red console, a red dock stand, a pair of red Joy-Cons, a red casing around the screen, and a blue Joy-Con grip. 
A limited-edition Nintendo Switch inspired by the iconic outfit worn by Mario. 
Additionally, for $300, the Mario-themed Switch also includes a screen protector and a special carrying case that includes various symbols associated with the Mario franchise at no additional cost. The Nintendo Switch included with the bundle is the updated model, which includes two more hours of battery life.
If you are planning to buy this console, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, the device does not include a copy of Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury, despite both products having the same release date. Secondly, these limited-edition Nintendo Switch consoles tend to sell out quickly, and there’s no telling if and when it will be restocked.

The GameStop stock roller coaster has come to the dip,https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262546/gamestop-amc-stock-down-short-squeeze,"Tue, 02 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Mitchell Clark
It hasn’t been a good day for WallStreetBets, as GameStop’s stock has plummeted today. AMC, the community’s other bet, dropped as well. But unlike previous dips, the stocks don’t appear to be rallying. Prices stayed low for the entire trading day, something that hasn’t happened since WallStreetBets became a household name one week ago.
When the market closed today, the price of GameStop was $90 even, an 81 percent drop from GameStop’s peak at $483, and a 58 percent drop from its price of $218 on Friday evening. AMC is down too, closing today at $7.82, which is a 61 percent drop from its peak at $19.88. 
It’s hard to believe that in August of last year, GameStop was trading at $4.50. Between then and last week, some investors bet that the stock was undervalued, driving it up to around $30 a share. Then, the WallStreetBets subreddit decided it would take the stock to the moon, punishing those betting against it and attempting to make money in the process. The idea of buying at $4 a share and selling for $400 obviously captured the public’s imagination, and millions rushed to give trading a try as the GameStop meme went mainstream — taking AMC and others along for the ride as investors realized they could pump those stocks too.
As to whether this is the end of GameStop’s wild ride, it’s almost impossible to tell. The past week’s peaks, dips, and drops have been detached from the underlying businesses. 
Part of that is the culture of WallStreetBets itself. Praising people for not selling their stocks, and ridiculing those that do is a recipe for a community that’s going to be stubborn. And now it’s started telling itself that the drop is due to hedge fund market manipulation. 
If this news has made you feel like reading about other stock market shenanigans, CNBC has an article that compares what’s happening now to the 2008 Volkswagen short squeeze, and Vox’s Recode has an interview with Henry Blodget, who was involved with the Dotcom bubble.
As for the people who have deep losses from today’s dive? They’re hoping for a rally, so they can at least sell for what they bought in for. Some, like Dutch student Evan Oosterink, are counting on it — he bet about $10,000, which represented “years of savings from his parents and some government college loans,” The Washington Post reported. He lost about $9,000 today, but is still holding the stock in the hope that he can recoup his loss. “Being a part of WallStreetBets, it’s like a religion you’re devoted to,” he said to The Washington Post.

The Verge’s favorite gaming gear,https://www.theverge.com/22244488/gaming-gear-recommendations-favorite-nintendo-logitech-microsoft,"Tue, 02 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Verge Staff

Gaming was already popular when the pandemic hit in early 2020; with a large number of people stuck at home, it has become close to a national obsession. So once you have your console or computer, and your game (or games), what more do you need?
We asked the staff of The Verge, many of whom are avid gamers, to talk about their favorite gaming gear. Below, we describe game controllers, mice, headsets, and other useful peripherals that can take your gaming experience up that extra notch (or even several notches). 
Have a great time!
If you have a non-Lite Nintendo Switch, the Pro Controller is a necessary accessory, in my opinion. Although the regular Switch comes with two Joy-Con controllers, they’re small and not particularly ergonomic. 
The Pro Controller, on the other hand, feels great to hold and has held up for me over hours of Fortnite, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and many other games. It’s not cheap, but it’s worth every penny. — Jay Peters, news writer
The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller serves a more traditional — and vastly more comfortable — controller alternative to the company’s Joy-Cons.
What can I say about the Logitech G502 line that has not already been said? My colleague, Cameron Faulkner, thinks it’s the best and most affordable wired take on the best gaming mouse you can buy right now — and rightfully so. 
I play a ton of first-person shooters on my gaming PC, so when I was in the market for a new gaming mouse (I previously used Corsair’s M65 RGB Elite), I wanted something that had a good amount of programmable buttons — including one on the mouse’s left-hand side — as easy shortcuts for when I needed to aim my weapons quickly. Now, each macro is assigned to a conveniently placed button. 
I have used a good number of gaming mice before switching to the G502 Hero, and I honestly do not think any other gaming mouse will replace it. I might buy the wireless version at some point to minimize cable management, but at $50, the G502 Hero is a great gaming mouse for people who prefer wired gaming mice or who don’t have a ton of money to splurge on its wireless counterpart. — Taylor Lyles, writer
Logitech’s G502 Hero has most of the same features of our top pick, the G502 Lightspeed — except it’s wired. If you’re okay with that, this is an excellent mouse that you can usually find for $50 or less.
Fifteen years ago, Microsoft released the best dongle ever made, one that I still use every single week. It’s an unconscionably long, six-foot USB cable with a little pod on the end that, uh, always reminds me of a Centauri tentacle. But this dongle is worth a little cringe: it lets me reliably connect four Xbox 360 wireless controllers to a Windows PC to play a wide array of games from across the room, and thanks to continued plug-and-play Windows functionality and robust Steam support, every game designed for controllers works perfectly with it. 
It’s an amazingly stable, inexpensive way to get four-player couch games (like Duck Game, SpeedRunners, TowerFall, Overcooked!, Spelunky, Lance A Lot, etc.) up and running quickly, particularly since Xbox 360 wireless controllers are cheap and easy to obtain. I wish I could say the same for the adapter itself; some of the third-party knockoffs have compatibility issues, and tracking down the original might mean a visit to eBay. That’s how I bought one for a buddy this past holiday. 
If you do find an official one that doesn’t light up, don’t throw it out! If you’re handy with a soldering iron, it’s pretty easy to replace (or even short) the burnt-out fuse. — Sean Hollister, senior news editor
A useful Microsoft dongle, it lets you reliably connect several Xbox 360 wireless controllers to a Windows PC to play a wide array of games. Not generally available at major retailers, you can find the genuine article for around $60 on eBay.
If you’re willing to pay a premium, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better wireless gaming headset than the Arctis Pro Wireless. In 2018, I pitted it against every single one of its competitors and it got top marks for sound quality, mic quality, wireless range, battery life, and an array of unusually handy features. 
If I’m gaming with buddies and want a snack, I don’t need to stop chatting — I just walk several rooms away to the kitchen and the audio never cuts out. When a too-loud game drowns out my friends, I tap the dial beneath the ear cup to rebalance the audio between “game” and “chat” — it gives you two different audio devices in Windows. When the battery runs out, I can just pop a spare battery pack out of the base station and swap it in under 15 seconds. I make a lot of calls with the Arctis Pro Wireless, too, thanks to its built-in Bluetooth. 
Just know it’s a little pinch-y on big heads, despite having the fabric band suspension design that makes a lot of SteelSeries’ other headsets comfortable. And be careful not to try to bend it wider using the ear cups; quite a few buyers have found the joints can snap if you apply too much force. — Sean Hollister

I love my Oculus Quest 2, but I’m not exaggerating when I say I find it almost unusable out of the box. The flimsy stock strap barely fits my head and makes the headset feel incredibly front-heavy, while the foam face pad gets hot and uncomfortable quickly. 
Fortunately, there are good solutions to both problems. Oculus sells an official Elite Strap for the Quest 2 for $49, which suggests the company itself knows the stock option isn’t great, and indeed it’s a huge improvement. It’s much sturdier, with a plastic back plate that better distributes weight and tightens around your head with an easily adjustable dial. There were reported issues with some early units cracking, but I haven’t had a problem with mine, and Oculus has addressed the issue with replacements and extended warranties, so I definitely recommend it.  — Sam Byford, Asia editor
The Elite Strap for the Quest 2 comes with a plastic backplate that better distributes weight and tightens around your head using an adjustable dial.
The next way to upgrade your Quest 2 experience is with a simple piece of rubber. Various companies sell alternative face pad covers, and the one I’ve been using is the Quest 2 silicone option from VR Cover. I used swappable cloth versions from VR Cover with the original Quest, which was still an improvement over the stock foam, but I like the hypoallergenic silicone even better. It attaches to the Quest 2 easily and is much more comfortable to have pressed against your face for hours than clammy foam; plus, you can rinse it down easily after a hardcore Beat Saber session. I don’t know why something like this doesn’t come in the box, but it’s absolutely worth the $14. — Sam Byford
The silicone cover for Oculus Quest 2 creates a protective barrier between your face and the stock foam.
This is a great accessory for anyone who wants to play emulated Wii games on their PC. It’s like the one that the Nintendo Wii console used to have, but offers Bluetooth to connect your Wii Remotes as well. I bought one of these for my own PC so I could use it to emulate Wii games — and hopefully get around to completing Metroid Prime 3 one of these days. 
Just remember that you’ll also need to grab a Wii Remote separately if you don’t already have one. — Jon Porter, reporter
This wireless sensor dolphin bar can connect your Wii remote plus controller to your PC by Bluetooth.
You’ve heard all the hype about the DualSense’s vibration motors and adaptive triggers. And to be sure, those things are awesome for the games that use them, but they aren’t what make the DualSense my favorite controller of those I’ve ever used. It’s that it has everything a modern controller needs. 
The DualShock 4 had a headphone jack, but also the terrible micro-USB. The Switch Pro Controller has USB-C, but it’s a bit small for my tastes and doesn’t have a headphone jack. The DualSense has both USB-C and a headphone jack, and that’s just such a quality-of-life improvement. When I need to charge it, I grab my laptop charger, and when I want to keep the noise to myself, I grab my headphones. There’s no friction between me and playing whatever game I want to play. — Mitchell Clark, news writer
The controller designed for the PS5, featuring adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone, and haptic feedback technologies.
It can be a real hassle to find the right gaming headset — one that’s both comfortable and compatible with most (or ideally, all) of your consoles. Few wireless solutions can do it all, but I really love using Creative’s BT-W3 USB-C Bluetooth receiver. It can pair to Bluetooth headphones you already own, making it a crafty and budget-minded purchase at around $40. It works seamlessly with PS5 and Nintendo Switch, and its USB-C-to-A adapter allows it to work perfectly on PC. Better yet, this dongle can toggle between low-latency and high-quality codecs with a push of a button, and it ships with a 3.5mm microphone that you can plug into your controller to chat with friends. — Cameron Faulkner, writer
Bluetooth 5.0 Audio Transmitter for PS4 / PS5 / Nintendo Switch / PC / Mac
I like to have the best audio possible, especially playing multiplayer games like CS:GO, Valorant, or Tom Clancy’s The Division 2. Because gaming headset mics will only do so much, I wanted a separate mic for audio output. Like I’ve mentioned before, that’s why I chose the QuadCast. 
At $140, it gives me great clarity when speaking, easy-to-use controls, and a shock mount adapter for boom arms. I also enjoy that the mute button is on top of the microphone. It might be unconventional, yet it’s conveniently placed if you’re using a boom arm, and it makes it easy to mute myself. It also comes with a three-meter cable; I find it annoying that some companies like Blue give you a too-short cable with their pricey USB mics. — Taylor Lyles
The HyperX QuadCast is a USB condenser mic compatible with PC, PlayStation consoles, and macOS. The bold red mic has four selectable pickup patterns, an internal pop filter for taming plosives, and a headphone jack for self-monitoring.
Here’s a slightly unconventional entry that has significantly improved my quality of life, so I want to share it with everyone here: a full-motion TV mount. Recently, I moved to a new, much smaller apartment. I had to find ways to maximize my space and, all joking aside, fit my rather large PS5 someplace. This is where the Echogear mount comes into play. 
The model that I got is incredibly well built and strong enough to hold TVs up to 125lbs or 86 inches diagonally. With my 55-inch LG CX, it’s smooth to operate, and I can move it around as needed to find the perfect angle — which I do, because another downside of my new place is that the windows are right across from the TV. I never thought I’d get so much use out of a TV wall mount. Plus, TVs look super nice mounted on the wall and it’s a fun little home improvement project. Just don’t try to do it all by yourself. — Vjeran Pavic, senior video director 
This well-built TV mount pulls out from the wall, points in any direction, and supports up to an 86-inch screen.
I’m not a huge fan of flight simulators and couldn’t justify spending hundreds of dollars on a full HOTAS kit. But when I heard Star Wars: Squadrons was coming out on PC, I couldn’t limit myself to playing on a keyboard or gamepad. I love Star Wars and wanted to ensure that I could recreate the experience of flying an X-Wing. 
I found the Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick on sale, and it’s truly one of the best gaming peripheral purchases I’ve made. It features 12 programmable buttons, an eight-way hat switch, and a nice hand grip for people who use their right hand while playing games. If you’re like me and only need it for a few titles, you can’t go wrong with this flight stick. — Taylor Lyles

Get the Nintendo Switch Lite with a $20 gift card for a limited time,https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/3/15/22332631/nintendo-switch-lite-deal-amazon-gamestop-best-buy-free-gift-card,"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Chris Welch, a reviewer specializing in personal audio and home theater.

Not everyone takes advantage of the “switch” aspect of the Nintendo Switch, and for them, the smaller, easier-to-carry Switch Lite is a worthwhile alternative. A few retailers are now tossing in a free $20 gift card when you purchase Nintendo’s more compact handheld. 
Amazon, Best Buy, and GameStop are all offering the deal, and all Switch Lite colors are eligible. So regardless of whether you prefer gray, yellow, blue, or coral, you’ll end up with an extra $20 to spend at the retailer you’re buying it from. 
Nintendo’s smaller, lighter Switch makes it easier to play your collection of Switch games on the go.
By going with the Lite model, you lose the ability to dock the Switch to a TV, and features like HD rumble are also omitted from the smaller hardware. But at least you get a better d-pad and sturdier design in exchange. And the downsized screen is the same resolution, so some people think it actually looks better thanks to the improved pixel density. 
With the extra $20, you can grab yourself a game on sale (or put it towards a must-buy like Super Mario 3D World), a screen protector, or maybe a carrying case. The Switch Lite isn’t as hard to come by as the regular Switch, which continues to face supply shortages, but it’s still proven to be a hit with many Nintendo fans as their main or secondary console.

"GameStop’s stock was on the rise again, until it wasn’t",https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323839/gamestop-stock-price-dramatic-rise-fall-stonks-return,"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Ian Carlos Campbell
GameStop stock (GME) soared in value on Wednesday, peaking at $348.50 per share. Then, in an event that’s definitely not cause for concern, minutes later it lost fully half its value by plummeting to $172, Bloomberg reports. Yes, “stonks” are back, and GameStop is once again in the crosshairs of online amateur investors.
Wednesday’s drama ultimately ended with the price settling back down to $265 per share, but it’s hard to not feel déjà vu. It seems like it was only yesterday when everyone was watching in a mixture of shock, amusement, and general concern as GME crested $483 per share. The rise and fall doesn’t quite compare, but the losses for anyone who sold during Wednesday’s dip in price are likely huge.
Having something you invested in suddenly worth 50 percent less can’t feel good, but it really depends when you originally bought in and if you’re still holding now: GME was worth $17 per share in January, but through some gonzo investing, the stock is now trading in the hundreds of dollars. It remains unprecedented. 
Like before, there’s no telling where this goes next, but I think it’s safe to say it isn’t over yet.

Fortnite has added a new skin to its collection that may look a touch familiar to internet dweebs. Diamond Hanz, introduced in Chapter 2, season 6, is a play on the beloved stonks man, but now on your squad. 
By “stonks,” I am of course talking about this:
For 1,200 V-Bucks, this rugged and weirdly kind of hot version of Mr. Stonks (a Megan Farokhmanesh™ official, do not steal) can be yours. He’s here to dance and ruin my life.
Fortnite has an already admirable collection of skins celebrating pop culture, fruit, and more, but this one is especially... special. Why anyone would suddenly be interested in stocks, I can’t possibly imagine. It’s not like there’s been any reason to talk about stocks lately, particularly in relation to video games. GameStop?

Nintendo’s new Mario-themed Switch is back in stock at several retailers,https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/3/9/22321083/mario-nintendo-switch-best-buy-walmart-switch-games-sale,"Tue, 09 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Taylor Lyles

“MAR10 Day” is tomorrow, but several retailers have already begun the festivities by making more stock available for the limited-edition Nintendo Switch that is based on the mustached plumber. 
The Nintendo Switch Mario Red & Blue Edition was released last month but has been hard to find since its launch. Now it is back in stock at several retailers, including Best Buy and GameStop. Retailing for $300, which is the normal price for Nintendo’s hybrid console, the limited-edition Switch features an all-red console, a red dock stand, a pair of red Joy-Cons, a red casing around the screen, and a blue Joy-Con grip. The console also includes a screen protector and a special carrying case for no additional cost.
A limited-edition Nintendo Switch inspired by the iconic outfit worn by Mario. 
Over at Best Buy, the retailer has knocked the prices down on a handful of Nintendo-published games for the Switch, such as Luigi’s Mansion 3 and Super Mario Maker 2; only physical cartridges have been discounted. 
Walmart has price-matched Best Buy, but the retailer has more games available and the option to buy either a digital or physical copy. Now if you plan to take advantage of these deals, you may use all of the Switch’s limited internal storage. Fortunately, SanDisk’s 200GB microSD card is on sale for as low as $22 at Newegg.
The standard Nintendo Switch ships with 32GB of internal storage, which won’t get you very far when it comes to downloading games. Adding a 200GB microSD card is a smart, relatively affordable way to give your storage a boost.
Speaking of Nintendo Switch accessories, if you prefer using your Switch in handheld mode but don’t want to spend $70 on a new pair of Joy-Cons, the best alternative is Hori’s Split Pad Pro controller. Usually $50, you can buy this controller for $40 at Amazon and Walmart. Most notably, this accessory includes an actual D-pad and more importantly, these controllers are bigger and more comfortable to use. 
The Split Pad Pro represents Hori’s take on the Nintendo Switch Pro controller, one that is split into two separate pieces. The Split Pad Pro is a good Joy-Con alternative for people who primarily play their Nintendo Switch in handheld mode. Read our review.

OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip is clever but clumsy,https://www.theverge.com/22338087/otterbox-mobile-gaming-clip-review-xbox-controller-cloud-price,"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Taylor Lyles
If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.
OtterBox, the company best known for its ruggedized cases, has developed a $30 clip that can attach your phone to an Xbox controller for playing games. Called the Mobile Gaming Clip, it’s part of a growing trend of accessories for playing cloud-based console games right on your phone. What makes OtterBox’s clip different is it can also work as a phone stand, separate from the controller — although the phone stand feature isn’t quite as robust as what I was hoping for.
OtterBox’s clip is designed specifically for Xbox controllers, and it works with controllers made for the Xbox One, Series X / S, or the Elite Series 2 controller. There’s also a little cutout for the charging port, meaning if you need to connect your Xbox controller to a USB cable, you will not need to remove the clip from the controller. You can also detach the arm from the clip itself and use it as a stand to prop up your smartphone for tabletop gaming, watching movies, or video calls.
With Microsoft rolling out xCloud, it’s partnering with multiple manufacturers to make a variety of mobile gaming accessory companies, including OtterBox, Razer’s Kishi, and 8BitDo’s SN30 Pro for Android, provide different experiences. Microsoft is aiming to ensure there is a big ecosystem of gaming peripherals once its cloud gaming service becomes more widely available.
Setup for the OtterBox Mobile Gaming Clip is straightforward: connect your Xbox controller to your phone, attach the clip to your controller, mount the phone, and start playing. It does require more force than other gaming clips to attach it to the controller. Once you have it properly installed, the clip tightly clasps across the controller, so you don’t have to worry about it getting loose and falling off. 
Some mobile gaming clips, like PowerA’s MOGA Mobile Gaming Clip, tend to feel unbalanced, particularly with a big or heavy phone or a phone with a bulkier case. OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip has a better distribution of weight, which made the controller feel a bit more balanced. 
One reason for that is OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip has a “rapid adjust feature,” which means you can adjust the angle of your phone when using the clip. The clip’s arm can extend a bit, allowing you to experiment with the angles you prefer. There’s also a latch located on the arm of the Mobile Gaming Clip that allows you to lock it in place so it doesn’t shift around while in use.
I had some issues when I tried to mount my phone
There are three claws to keep your phone in place. The bottom claw extends, allowing bigger phones to fit into the accessory by extending a few centimeters. This makes it easy to fit bigger phones into the gaming clip. The claws don’t block me from reaching the volume or power buttons on my iPhone XR, though it is a bit cumbersome to have to unlock my phone while using the mount because it’s sideways in the mount. The design also makes it easy to use a pair of wired earbuds or connect a charger to charge my phone while I continue gaming.
I did have some issues when I tried to mount my phone; the phone case I use primarily has a PopSocket attached in the center, and it added too much thickness and made my phone less secure in the clip, even popping out when I moved the clip even slightly. I ended up having to remove the case from my phone every time I wanted to use the clip. If you don’t have an accessory like a PopSocket on your phone, the clip should work with almost any standard case.  
The most interesting feature for OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip is tabletop mode. You can switch from the controller to tabletop mode by detaching the arm to the clip portion of the accessory, allowing you to use the gaming clip as a viewing stand for gaming or even watching movies and TV shows. The tabletop feature is an ambitious idea, but it ends up being more of a kickstand than an actual stand. You have limited ability to adjust the angle of the phone in this mode, and you can’t raise the phone up off the table in any way. 
Yet, the option for a tabletop mode does address one of the biggest problems with mobile gaming clips: hand fatigue from the weight of a controller, phone, and clip combined. OtterBox helps solve this problem by allowing you the ability to take a break from the gaming clip but still giving you that freedom to continue gaming on your phone. 
In the last few years, the cloud and mobile gaming market has become a more exciting space in the industry, with successful free-to-play titles like Call of Duty Mobile and Microsoft truly beginning its push into cloud gaming. As cloud gaming continues to grow,  there’s likely going to be a big expansion in the availability and variety of gaming clips like this one. This means if you do not like the current options available on the market, there is a high probability that similar products will be released in the coming months and years.
OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip is not the perfect mobile gaming accessory, but it is one of the better mobile gaming accessories available now. It allows me the option to use a controller I own and not one designed for a specific product (aside from the fact that it has to be an Xbox controller). It’s also a bit more flexible in how to use it when compared to other mobile gaming accessories such as the Razer Kishi, which encloses your phone in a pair of controllers. 
At $30, OtterBox’s clip is less expensive than those solutions, but there are still cheaper options if you want to clip your phone to an existing controller. I like how the clip does not feel unbalanced when attached to the controller, and the tabletop mode is interesting. But it ends up feeling like more of an afterthought because of how limited the clip ends up being when used on a table. Yet, the things OtterBox’s Mobile Gaming Clip does right are enough to justify the $5 to $10 price premium compared to other options available on the market.

Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Headset is a mic-drop moment,https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review,"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Cameron Faulkner
If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.
Microsoft’s new $99 Xbox Wireless headset isn’t perfect, but it’s the best attempt at being an Xbox gaming headset and an everyday set of wireless headphones I’ve tried yet. It’s compatible with the Xbox Wireless protocol, making it easy to pair with any Xbox One or Xbox Series X / S console. It’s also compatible with Bluetooth (version 4.2, SBC codec), and better yet, it can connect through both protocols simultaneously. So you can take a call or have audio from any app come through from a phone, tablet, or a PC mixed in with the sound coming from your Xbox console.
This is far from the first gaming headset to do this, or even do it well. Microsoft’s latest headset just stands out as being particularly impressive for the number of things it gets right for $99. Its design is stellar, a logical fit in the company’s headphone lineup. Next to the Series X, it looks the part with a touch of glossy green detailing around the ear cup dials, covered in matte black plastic. The little holes in the recessed areas between the faux leather ear pads and the dials seem to be there just for cosmetic reasons, but it looks fantastic nevertheless. 
Crucially, these are comfortable, even though my head size nearly pushes them to their size limits. The sidearms require two hands to make adjustments, which I like. There’s no worry that they’ll resize just from being moved around. And while I wish this model had a bungee-style headband and swiveling ear cups like most SteelSeries headsets, not having these features didn’t equate to comfort issues here.
In addition to how the headset looks, its functionality is similar to the Surface Headphones, with twistable dials on the outside of each ear cup for adjusting elements of the audio. Unlike the company’s more premium headphones, there’s no active noise cancellation here (I’d complain, but they’re $99), though the passive noise isolation is better than average for this price. The left dial acts as a chat and game audio mixer, so you can tune your playmates down a bit during a dialogue-heavy cutscene or vice versa. I appreciate that Microsoft put it front and center. On the other dial is the volume control. Twist to increase or decrease, nice and simple — no buttons necessary.
Over on the right ear cup, there’s a USB-C port for charging. Microsoft includes a USB-C to USB Type-A cable to charge it, but you’ll get all of the same headset features if you plug into a Windows 10 machine with your own USB-C to USB-C cable. That’s not the case when plugged into a MacBook Pro, which won’t work over a wired connection with the headset. You can still connect to a macOS device and use the headset over Bluetooth, though.
There are only two buttons on the headset: one to manually mute the bendable microphone (an LED on the inner section of the boom microphone angled toward your face is illuminated when the mic is hot), and another that serves as the all-in-one pairing and power button, both of which reside on the left ear cup. Most gaming headsets require days of continued use to fully learn their respective button layouts, but this one’s dead simple. I would have taken one more button if it served as a multifunction button to control my device over Bluetooth, but Microsoft has limited the headset to just two buttons. There’s no way to independently control, say, a phone outside of just adjusting the volume.
The sound performance from this headset is better than I expected. During my tests, I listened to Spotify, and the music sounded good enough to stick with this headset instead of automatically reaching for my Sony 1000XM3s. People with a knack for stellar audio quality will find quibbles, like that the sound can come off as muddled at times, and the soundstage isn’t as expansive as you’d find in a more expensive set of headphones. But again, these are $99 and meant for gaming first. And for that price, I’m pleased. 
Hopping over to gaming, I instantly booted up Doom (2016) on the Series X. The soundtrack and all of the various hellish sound effects have an adequate amount of crunch and punch, and I was head-banging to the music while I played. It sounded as it was intended to sound, though, again, the same nitpicks apply here as they do for music. When there’s a lot happening in the mid and high frequencies, the sound can lack clarity if you’re listening closely. I didn’t notice that as much in Yakuza: Like a Dragon, for instance. This headset works with the Dolby Atmos (Microsoft is giving buyers a trial of Dolby Atmos with purchase that will last until the end of September) and DTS: X paid apps available for Xbox and PC, which might enhance the sound. But for the purposes of this review, I tested just the out-of-the-box experience.
The battery life and range are competitive with other gaming headsets I’ve tested in this price range. Microsoft claims 15 hours per charge, and both times I ran the non-replaceable battery down during testing, it lasted for about that long. I was able to roam about my studio apartment, straying about 25 feet or so from the Xbox without experiencing any drop-outs. It started cutting out when the signal had to go through multiple walls, but that’s to be expected. As for charge speeds, Microsoft says it can gain four hours of use out of a 30-minute charge, or a full charge in three hours. In case you were wondering, you can use the Xbox Wireless headset while it’s being charged, but obviously, it’ll then take longer to recharge.
To give you a sense of how this headset handles connections, I first paired the Xbox Wireless headset to my PC with Microsoft’s USB Wireless Adapter (not included with this headset, but it operates on the same Xbox Wireless protocol as the consoles) for music and to take some video calls. Pairing the headset required pressing and holding the pair button for four seconds and doing the same to the Wireless Adapter. To use them on the Xbox Series X, I had to run through the same process. Frustratingly, the headset can’t handle juggling between two previously paired devices that use the Xbox Wireless protocol, so I had to manually re-pair it when I wanted to hop between my PC and the Xbox. I don’t want to overblow this issue, though. Microsoft’s pairing process for Xbox accessories is very simple. This won’t be a problem at all if you connect to your PC via Bluetooth (as I imagine most people will) since the headset can connect to both concurrently.
If you’re someone who’s likely to lean heavily on the concurrent wireless connection feature, I like that this headset automatically lowers the audio streaming from the Xbox Wireless protocol device when a call is incoming so you can hear it. You can adjust the volume of just your Bluetooth device with its own controls, but not from the headset itself. Cranking the volume with the dial makes it louder for both devices you’re connected to.
The level of customization this headset allows is also impressive for the price. Through the Xbox Accessories app for Windows 10 or Xbox, you can adjust the equalizer (movie, music, game, heavy bass, and speech are the presets, or make your own) and boost the bass. Additionally, there’s an auto-mute feature that can mute noises happening in your surroundings. There are three levels (low, medium, and high), and Microsoft says each step up will increase how aggressively the mic mutes things that aren’t your voice. During a video call, it seemed to work as intended, if not better than I expected. The person on the other end said that my speech wasn’t getting cut off, which is something that can happen with these kinds of features, and that happenings in the background weren’t noticeable. Of course, the effectiveness of this auto-mute feature can vary depending on your household situation. If you’re skeptical, it’s easy enough to just tap the mute button to avoid potential embarrassment. 
Two other small but cool features in the Xbox Accessories app let you tweak how bright the mute light is, making it easier to see in your peripheral vision. You can also customize the level of mic monitoring or how much outside sound is fed through the mics and then funneled into your ears.
Up until now, the $150 Razer Kaira Pro was the Xbox-specific headset I told people to get because it’s comfortable, and it supports Bluetooth in addition to the Xbox Wireless protocol. Microsoft’s new Xbox Wireless headset is well ahead of that model in terms of design, ease of use, and functionality — all in a more affordable package. 
If Microsoft is to be judged compared to Sony on how well it designed a headset to accompany its latest consoles — as it inevitably will be — this one handily edges out the Pulse 3D even though they’re the same price. Sony’s model is comfortable and looks equally dashing next to the console it was made for, and it has a 3.5mm headphone jack and 3D Audio support in its court. 
But it’s tough to compete with the Bluetooth support and button-lite design built into Microsoft’s model. I would have loved it if a USB dongle was included for more support with devices, like the Nintendo Switch. But by design, it can’t connect to other gaming consoles. Microsoft is keeping this one in the family. If you’re in the family, though, you’re in for a treat.

Correction: The Xbox Wireless headset can get four hours of use from a 30-minute charge. This review incorrectly stated that a 15-minute charge could get you three hours of use. We regret this error.

PS5 and Xbox Series X bundles are in stock at GameStop [UPDATE: Sold Out],https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22384062/ps5-and-xbox-series-x-bundle-restocks-gamestop,"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Taylor Lyles

Update: April 14th, 2021 3:04PM ET: Bundles for both the PS5 and Xbox Series X are now sold out at GameStop.
Due to the global electronic component shortage, it has been extremely difficult to buy any next-gen hardware. Whether you want Sony’s PS5 or Microsoft’s Xbox Series X, the restocks are far and stock is limited. Fortunately, GameStop is restocking a limited number of bundles for both systems today, while supplies last. 
The PS5 Digital Edition bundle — which includes the console, plus one-year subscriptions for PS Plus and PS Now, an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card — is selling for $600, which may sound like a lot until you factor the retail price for each item separately. 
The second bundle costs $730. At that price, it nets you one PS5 with a disc drive, two $70 games (Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Launch Edition and Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War), an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card.

PS5 bundles are in stock at GameStop [UPDATE: Sold Out],https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363752/sony-ps5-console-bundle-restocks-gamestop,"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Taylor Lyles

Update April 2nd, 2021: 9:47AM ET: GameStop has sold all of the stock available for its three PS5 bundles.
If you have been keeping up with PS5 news, you will know that it is nearly impossible to find this console right now because of the short supply and mostly online-only sales. If you don’t mind buying a bundle, which includes additional items alongside the PS5, GameStop has restocked several PS5 bundles right now. 
There are two bundles we found that may be worth a buy if you are interested in what each package contains. 
The PS5 Digital Edition bundle — which includes the console, plus one-year subscriptions for PS Plus and PS Now, an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card — is selling for $600, or about $200 more than the console alone goes for. Purchasing all of these items individually would tally up to the same $600, so you’re not forced into a marked-up price.
A bundle, which includes the $400 PS5 Digital Edition, plus one-year memberships to PlayStation Plus and PlayStation Now, in addition to an extra game controller and a $20 gift card to GameStop. 
The second bundle costs $730. At that price, it nets you one PS5 with a disc drive, two $70 games (Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Launch Edition and Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War), an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card. Normally, all this stuff would retail for roughly $720 before tax, so there is a small price increase if you were to buy these items separately. 
A bundle that includes the $500 next-gen console, two games (Returnal and MLB The Show 21), an extra DualSense controller, plus a GameStop $20 gift card. 
There is also a third bundle up for sale today at GameStop. For $760, you get the following: a PS5 console, which includes the disc drive; three games (Marvel’s Avengers, Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Launch Edition, and Hitman 3), an extra controller, plus a $20 gift card to GameStop. Adding up all these items together separately retails for about the same, so there’s no price gouging going on here, assuming you want all of these add ons.

The stonks guy is now in Fortnite,https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361908/fortnite-stonks-skin-gamestop-stocks,"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Megan Farokhmanesh
Fortnite has added a new skin to its collection that may look a touch familiar to internet dweebs. Diamond Hanz, introduced in Chapter 2, season 6, is a play on the beloved stonks man, but now on your squad. 
By “stonks,” I am of course talking about this:
For 1,200 V-Bucks, this rugged and weirdly kind of hot version of Mr. Stonks (a Megan Farokhmanesh™ official, do not steal) can be yours. He’s here to dance and ruin my life.
Fortnite has an already admirable collection of skins celebrating pop culture, fruit, and more, but this one is especially... special. Why anyone would suddenly be interested in stocks, I can’t possibly imagine. It’s not like there’s been any reason to talk about stocks lately, particularly in relation to video games. GameStop? Never heard of it!

"Dogecoin is on a run, has escaped the yard, and is headed to the moon",https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387486/dogecoin-run-valuation-cryptocurrency-spike-elon-musk,"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg. 
Oh, super, Dogecoin is spiking. The joke currency, which as recently as January 27th was worth less than a cent, hit 47 cents this morning, according to Robinhood’s tracker. As I type this, the market cap is more than $51 billion.
The currency is based on an au-courant-as-of-2013 meme of a Shiba Inu, and was intended to satirize bitcoin. Well, kids, the joke’s over. It’s now a top-10 cryptocurrency.
Weird year for finance, honestly. There was the Gamestonk thing which made GameStop stock so valuable, a member of the board of directors had to step down so that he could sell shares without restrictions. (Noted investor David Einhorn accused Elon Musk of pouring “jet fuel” on the January rally; a hedge fund called the top of the January rally based on the Musk tweet and raked in the dough.) Keith “Roaring Kitty” Gill stands to make millions, which he will presumably use to buy fancier headbands. NFT mania seized the world, after artist Beeple — aka Mike Winkelmann —  sold an NFT of Everydays: The First 5,000 Days for $69 million. Coinbase went public earlier this week, and closed its first day of trading worth more than the company behind the Nasdaq, the exchange it trades on.
Last night, Musk — a shitposter with a hobby of being CEO of Tesla and SpaceX — tweeted “Doge Barking at the Moon.” For those of you fortunate enough to have avoided internet-related brainworms: a bunch of people probably thought this was a reference to a phrase used by internet traders, “to the moon.” Musk, who is known for coming to memes late, has called dogecoin his favorite cryptocurrency. In February, he called it “The People’s Crypto.”
Look, it’s not my fault that the interest rate is zero percent — that was always gonna make shit weird, because there’s almost nowhere safe to park your money without losing some of it to inflation. That means a lot more money is sloshing around than usual, which is fueling everything from SPACs to Gamestonk. What worries me is that we could be locked into zero interest rate policy world for as long as five years, which is an awfully long time for memes to mess with actual money. As long as there’s this much money sloshing around, anything goes. Anyway, if you are a hedge fund that called the top on Dogecoin based on an Elon Musk tweet, let me know — I’d love to interview you and find out how that call went.

Last week, Humble launched its Spring Into VR Bundle, which includes a pack of games for use with a virtual reality headset. Originally set to end on April 21st, the company has decided to extend the deal until April 28th, giving you more time to take advantage of it. 
You can pay as little as $1 to receive one game or pay at least $15 to unlock all eight games available in the pack — once you’ve paid, you’ll get keys that you redeem on Steam. The bundle contains the following games, all of which are compatible with wired headsets that support Steam VR:

If you have been keeping up with the news about next-gen consoles, you will know that it is extremely difficult to purchase any next-gen gaming system. This includes not only the PS5, but some of its accessories, like the HD Camera.  If you managed to get your hands on a PS5 and are looking to buy this camera accessory, B&H Photo has the product in stock and has knocked $10 off its original price, bringing the price down to $50. 
Sony’s PlayStation 5 HD Camera records and streams 1080p and has a built-in stand for mounting above or below your TV. With the PS5’s software, you can also crop or remove your background for picture-in-picture streams.
While we are on the topic of PS5 accessories on sale, the DualSense controller is back down to its lowest price of $60 at B&H Photo. When you purchase a PS5, it includes one DualSense controller, but if you plan to share this console with other people or play local co-op games with friends and family, you’re going to want to purchase an extra controller. 
The controller designed for the PS5, featuring adaptive triggers, a built-in microphone, and haptic feedback technologies.
Finally, at our sister site, The Strategist's Two-Day (Actually Good) Sale is underway. The two-day event contains deals on over 40 items selected by The Strategist's editors. One highlight is Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones, which are marked down to $268 from $348 at B&H Photo.

Nickmercs is still winning,https://www.theverge.com/22385597/nickmercs-twitch-streaming-mlg-gamebattles-sypherpk,"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Bijan Stephen
Illustration by Alex Castro
The first thing you see is his forehead, because Nick “Nickmercs” Kolcheff is hunched forward and focused on his on-screen opponents. (Gamer stance, for the initiated.) The second thing you see is his crosshair begin to make its way, unerringly, to an opponent’s head. And this all happens live, in what feels like a split-second, broadcast to the tens of thousands who have opened up Twitch specifically to see this — forehead, crosshair — in real time. And he does this hundreds of times an hour, entertaining millions. 
It’s almost like magic, especially if you, like me, have tried streaming or playing first-person shooters. Being good at entertaining people (streaming) has almost nothing to do with the intimate knowledge of mechanics of good crosshair placement (FPS games). You can stream for hours to nobody, and you can put thousands of hours into a game and still fail to break into the highest levels of play. But Nick — always Nick, never Kolcheff, unless you were his commanding officer — is different. 
Built different, you might say. He started out as a Gears of War 2 national champion, back when American esports was figuring out how to professionalize; today, he’s one of the most subscribed-to streamers on Twitch. His journey — from there, if you like, to here — is fascinating, not least because it mirrors nearly exactly how gaming itself went mainstream. In a word: Nick is the blueprint. 
I should say here that we’ve never met — never video chatted, even. So I don’t have any beautiful scenes with him for you, no anecdotes that describe the kind of food he orders for dinner and what that says about his game sense, nothing about what it’s like to play in a squad beside him, or what it might say about his character if he declined to revive me at a particularly crucial moment. Which probably makes me a lot like you, the person reading this. 
I lied about the food thing, though. I can tell you about a steak. “We went to this really fancy LA-like restaurant, and they had all these weird things on the menu,” says Ali “SypherPK” Hassan, when I reach him by phone. The year was 2019; they were hanging out because it was TwitchCon, the annual convention the platform throws for its streamers and viewers. “But Nick is very traditional when it comes to food. He just wanted some steak. And that’s really all he came for,” Hassan says. “And there was no steak on the menu.” 
I can tell you about a steak
Even parsing the menu was difficult, Hassan told me, which is one way to know a restaurant is fancy. “They kept bringing out these strange menu items, like this salad that was frozen in liquid nitrogen or something like that. It was insane,” says Hassan. “And Nick absolutely hated everything. And every time [the waitress] came out, he was like, ‘Excuse me, miss, could you please bring me a steak.’ He just kept asking for a steak.” There was no steak.
By the end of that night, it seemed like the restaurant had finally heard Nick’s pleas: he got a steak. But it was too late. He’d lost his appetite from picking at all of the other more adventurous dishes sent their way. “He was really frustrated. And everybody had to share the steak so that it didn’t go to waste. He was super upset, of course.” He still tipped big on their bill, because obviously. “We ended up going and grabbing burgers, even though we had just spent probably like a couple thousand at this really fancy restaurant.”
Allow me to draw a few conclusions. Nick is intense about his goals (repeatedly asking for a steak), but he’s generous in their pursuit (tipping big), and he always brings his friends along for the ride even if it’s a little annoying (making them get burgers after spending thousands of dollars on a fancy meal). 
I didn’t get to have burgers with Nick, but I did manage to finagle a couple of calls with him. And while I had him on the line, he was very generous with his time. Whether I was talking to Nick or any of the people he knows, I always felt like I was getting the same guy — the guy who wanted a steak and who wasn’t going to stop asking until he got one. The same guy, in other words, as the one you see whenever you open up Twitch. 
Nick pulls in an average of around 50,000 concurrents every stream — meaning every time you tune in, on average, he’s got about as many people watching him as live in Bozeman, Montana (at least according to the 2019 census). His chat is always set to subscriber-only mode because, with that many people, it’s nearly impossible to recognize coherent sentences. Even so, the MFAM — that’s Mercs Family — keeps the chat moving pretty quick. According to the metrics site Twitch Tracker, Nick has more than 67,000 active subscriptions, which is good enough to make him the fourth-most-subscribed-to streamer on Twitch. (He’s currently 18th in terms of viewership.) 
All of this is to say that, in a lot of ways, Nick is Twitch. He’s been streaming on the site since 2010 when it was Justin.tv and when esports and live-streaming were still online novelties to most people. Back then, the biggest going concern was Major League Gaming (MLG), which organized and ran tournaments with significant cash prizes. Nick was playing with a professional team called TH3 NSAN3Z — stylizing theirs — when they won the Gears of War 2 national championship in 2009 and the team walked home $40,000 richer. They kept winning big at other tourneys, too.
But Nick has always been good at games. It’s his talent. His foray into online gaming started when he was 14 years old — a Detroit teen — he says, with Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory’s multiplayer mode, a 2 v. 2 battle between spies and mercenaries. (Because we’re just about the same age, I can tell you the year was 2005.) “And I got really good, man,” Nick says. “I mean, me and my buddy played gamebattles.com, man, and we hopped on the ladder, and we beat the shit out of everybody.” 
Everything changed for Nick that year because that’s when the original Gears of War came out. “I was 15 years old, and I was in high school. I was a freshman or sophomore,” he remembers. “I saw the commercial on TV, I rode my Haro bike up to GameStop to buy it.” Young Nick plays Gears and then plays it more via GameBattles, the best (and, at the time, just about the only) place for competitive online gaming. He falls in love. He meets and befriends fellow streamer CDNThe3rd, and their teams fight against each other in Gears’ 2 v. 2 mode. He wins.
But Nick says it was so competitive that he asked CDN and his teammate to join up to make a four-man squad. To “fast-forward through the boring bullshit,” as Nick says, they crushed. “We went like 80 and 0. I mean, we did not lose a single fuckin’ match. And we took it very seriously,” he says. Their names were on top of the GameBattles page. And because social media was in its infancy — YouTube, as you may recall, launched in 2005 — there was nowhere else to see who was best. To put a button on this capsule of gaming history: MLG buys GameBattles.com, adds Gears to its professional circuit, and suddenly, Nick and his team are flying across the country to compete at LAN events. 
As a team, they didn’t make much money — after everything was split, they had just about enough to cover their expenses — but they got to be pros. “On LAN, I was always real colorful. And if I beat your ass, I would let your mom know that I beat your ass,” says Nick. “Like ‘Yo, is this your son? Is this your fucking son? Who brought him here? Did you fucking bring him here?’” 
In a lot of ways, Nick is Twitch
After he’d convinced his family that he could play and succeed as a pro, he had thousands of dollars burning a hole in his pockets from LAN tourney winnings. He was still in high school. “I remember having to go up to Bank of America, and I had to deposit like 10 grand in cash,” he says. 
He was living the dream, but he wanted to go bigger. “Because at that point, I was watching a lot of the Halo guys playing, like Walshy and Ogres” — some of the best players of all time, playing an even more popular title — “I was really itching to go play at that level in front of a crowd and perform,” Nick says. “Because I felt like, no matter what game I touched at the time, I was that little crackhead, man. I was really fucking good. And I got really good fast.” 
Which is true. I recalled an earlier conversation I had with Nick, where he described his gaming prowess. Let me quote from my transcript: 
I’m like that kid in eighth grade. [You know the kid who] had big balls and a big dick? You know what I mean? Remember? When I was in eighth grade, I’ll never forget it. I grew up a little faster than everybody. I was really good at football, and I was beating the shit out of everybody. [I always thought] I’m kind of like that guy. But listen, eventually, everybody’s gonna catch up to that guy. Because they all mature, their balls drop. And everybody’s on the same fucking playing field. Perfect analogy. That’s how I am. I get on the game, I’m better than everybody off the rip, but give them like a month or two months, and it’s over. 
Anyway, it wasn’t all winning and playing games professionally. Nick told me his family wasn’t initially supportive of his teenage gaming habits; they were sports people. “I hated fucking school, man. I couldn’t stand it. Because, you know, it kept me away from the games. And my dad and mom, they would never let me play,” he says. “So the only time that I could play was when they went to bed. So I’d be up all night playing, and then I’d get in trouble for not going to school or for getting up late or whatever.”  
His dad played college ball and then coached at Michigan under Bo Schembechler and Gary Moeller. Both of his uncles played college ball. His grandfather played in college, too. Today, his little brother is a wrestler in Missouri, and three of his cousins are in the NFL. One starts for the Bears. “Even the girls, man. I got a couple girl cousins that played like, at D1 colleges for volleyball and softball,” Nick says. “They’re just huge chicks man. Big shoulders, big backs. You know what I mean? Big, big chicks.” 
“I hated fucking school, man.”
He had to prove to his family that he was as good at gaming as they were at sports, which was a tall order. (And it should be noted, Nick recalls that he was pretty good at sports himself — though never as good as he was at gaming.) It led to fights, like the one with his mother where she was so mad that he was up late playing games that she put his Xbox into a trash bag, brought it out onto the front lawn, and smashed it into a million pieces. Nick says she was afraid for him. 
“She was afraid of attitude. She was afraid of failure,” he says. “And listen, I was a tough kid to raise, man. Imagine trying to raise a kid that loves something so much that isn’t there yet. Like gaming was not there yet,” he says. “So they were just trying to be good parents. They were doing the right thing.” 
After high school, though, Nick found himself adrift. He’d been a Gears pro through high school, but his parents had been right, sort of: gaming wasn’t really something you could do for a living, at least not then, not unless you worked as a game developer. Nick enrolled in community college for about a year and didn’t finish. “I remember I called my wife” — Emumita Bonita, as he calls her, whom he met when he was 12 and whom he married when he was 29 — “and I was like, ‘I think I’m going to be a nurse.’” He told his dad that he kind of wanted to go to school to be a cop. “I was just a confused 18-, 19-, 20-year-old not really knowing what I wanted to do,” he says. In community college, he spent his Pell Grant and his loans on “gaming shit and gym equipment,” in his words, while pretending he was a diligent student. He was lost. 
“I spent way too much time on the internet, bro,” Nick says. “And I watched the videos. I watched the videos on some sites that you just shouldn’t be watching. Man, I saw people get their fuckin’ heads cut off, little kids doing the craziest shit. A lot of fucked-up stuff out there in the world that just pissed me off.” It made him look into the military. He wanted to do something about the evil he was seeing in the world — and so he joined the Navy on a special ops contract. Nick wanted to be a SEAL. He quit gaming to do it.
He was lost
“It was one of, if not the, hardest thing I’ve ever tried to do in my life,” he says. “I got a lot of friends nowadays. They’re SEALs that made it all the way through.” 
But he didn’t make it. He couldn’t hack the underwater stuff, which is fairly important if you want to be a Navy SEAL. (The “S” stands for “sea.”) He could do everything else — the running, the pushups, the physical conditioning. His only demerits were for the underwater swim specifically. Eventually, one of his superiors called him to his office. “He told me to cut the bullshit. He goes, ‘Listen, man, I’m this guy. You’re Nick. We’re just two dudes talking right now. Cut the fucking shit. What’s going on? How come you can’t pass the underwater stuff?” Nick recalls. “I said, ‘Listen, man. I’m trying. I get underwater, and I get real panicky. I get about halfway through whatever we’re doing, and I try to come up for air or I’m gonna pass the fuck out.’” 
“He goes, ‘Well, pass the fuck out then,’” Nick remembers. And so he got a couple more tries at the underwater swim — tries that he wasn’t necessarily supposed to get. Nick does his best. He stays underwater. And then he wakes up on the pool deck with an instructor screaming wake the fuck up! at him. He’d passed out. His best wasn’t good enough.
Ultimately, that superior let Nick stick around on base as a helper. “I was a janitor. I cleaned toilets at Coronado for like two or three hours a day,” he says. “And then I got cut. It was like a big vacation, man. It was pretty chill.” 
Nick went back to community college, right back where he started. “I was super confused again. I didn’t know what the fuck I wanted to do with my life,” he says. So he started gaming again. His friends who’d stuck around told him to stream — told him that people actually subscribed and donated, like it was a normal thing. “I was going to community college again, and I was streaming on the side. And the stream just took over, man,” he says. “I went from 100 subs to 200 subs to 300 to 1,000, you know, just cruising. And that’s when I realized, you know, that it was gonna be a real thing.” 
You know the story from there. Nick’s stream takes off. He plays different games — Halo, Call of Duty, Fortnite, and then back to Call of Duty. Each is its separate turning point in his career. He signs to 100 Thieves and then leaves after a contract dispute. He signs to FaZe Clan, of which he’s now a part-owner. FaZe, by the way, is happy to talk about Nick. “More than anything else, what really drew us to say we wanted to work with him is what he had built with MFAM and how he interacted with his fans and the way that he treated every single person around him as if they were family,” says Darren Yan, head of talent at FaZe. “He was a jack-of-all-trades.” Yan says Nick is the kind of person FaZe wants its audience to look up to, as a kind of elder statesman in gaming. (Though he, like me, is not old.) “Nick is a very, very unique and special individual. I don’t think someone like him comes often,” says Yan. “He’s definitely a generational talent.”
And I agree; it takes a lot of work and a decent amount of emotional intelligence to corral 67,000 paying gamers into a group that’s coherent, broadly nontoxic, and welcoming. That Nick has managed it is a testament to how long he’s been in the scene. He came up through the toxic LAN parties and Xbox Live lobbies that gamers today define themselves against. I tend to think that communities reflect streamers, and if an audience is toxic, then a broadcaster has, in some ways, encouraged that. (Note that I am not talking about the people who pop into streams to troll women or people of color; I’m talking about regulars who also happen to be shitheads.)
“I cleaned toilets at Coronado for like two or three hours a day.”
But I want to back up a bit. I glossed over Nick’s meteoric rise on Twitch because, from the outside, it seems inevitable. “Former pro player with a hugely competitive streak and an affable bro personality streaming shoot-y games” is as good a recipe for success on Twitch as any — except tons of those people stream, and almost none are as successful as Nick is. Partially, I think it’s structural. The business of gaming changed and matured over the years Nick’s been streaming. The biggest change, probably, was major advertisers and large corporations recognizing that people who played games were a valuable group to target. That meant money began to flow into the scene in the form of bigger tournament prizes and sponsorships even for smaller streamers. At the same time, the rise of social media meant more people than ever could participate — sharing clips, organizing events, and paying gaming creators directly. 
Streaming, meanwhile, exploded. In 2011, Justin.tv bet on gaming and launched Twitch.tv as its own site, which quickly became the main business. The company pivoted, and Twitch was acquired by Amazon in 2014 for $970 million. Competing streaming platforms launched, like Mixer (2016–2020, F), YouTube Gaming (2015), and Facebook Gaming (2018). Streamers became a category of online influencer that was legible to people outside of gaming, and it brought people who played games for a living directly in front of their fans. 
Against that backdrop, I think it’s easier to see how Nick was perfectly positioned to succeed. He had the passion. He had the talent. He was willing to grind out the hours necessary to grow a community. And he switched up the games he was streaming because, he says, he felt like it. “When I’m not having fun, everybody fuckin knows,” he says, by way of explanation. Playing what’s popular matters, but clearly not as much as having fun. 
“If I’m not having fun, it’s just not as good content.”
When Nick switched from playing Call of Duty to Fortnite, just after the game had come out, he says he lost half his subscribers — he went from 5,000 or so to 2,000 or so. When you consider that, generally speaking (because there are exceptions), Twitch takes half of the $5 a viewer pays for a subscription, it works out to a big hit to your income. “When you lose half of that because of a game that you switch to... it’s crazy. It was demoralizing. But that’s happened to me a couple times in my career,” he says. “I knew that, you know what, if I’m not having fun, it’s just not as good content. I’d rather switch games and have fun and be myself and enjoy what I’m playing. And I think they’ll enjoy the stream more.”
Even so, it was a gamble. “I lucked out in the sense where Fortnite blew up and we had no idea it was gonna blow up. And then here I am, this fucking console player, beating the shit out of PC kids,” he says. “And they’re like, how the hell’s he doing this shit? Aim assist. Big, big, big part of it.” (They’ve since nerfed it.)
But if Nick was popular on Twitch before, Fortnite was the game that made him a gamer household name. And he’s thankful because the game also boosted the streaming industry in general. “I’ve played a lot of games. I’ve spent a lot of time in esports,” he says. “It is a fact that there’s just no game like Fortnite.” He even spends some of his time off stream watching competitive play and “beatin’ the shit out of little 12-year-olds on Fortnite every day, baby.” 
That’s how I found Nick on Twitch, actually — through his Fortnite streams, where he played with Ali “SypherPK” Hassan and others. Nick’s Fortnite gameplay is mesmerizing; it gives you the same feeling of seeing a wrecking ball go through a building or watching a controlled detonation happen. Destruction in the service of creation, if you’d like. 
Naturally, it was only a matter of time until Nick got sick of streaming ‘Fortnite’
Playing beside him, however, is another matter entirely. “It’s honestly like playing a professional sport,” says Hassan, who was a basketball player himself back in the day. “Playing with Nick brings me back to the times when we’re, you know, on the court, and I’m playing with my teammates, and we’re yelling back and forth at each other. And it’s super intense, high energy.” Nick and Hassan met after Nick had been lurking in his streams, learning Fortnite tips. (Hassan, a wonderfully compelling streamer in his own right, is something of a Fortnite professor.) In 2018, they played together for the first time after Hassan slid into Nick’s Twitter DMs; the event was the first Friday Fortnite tournament — which was one of the first major Fortnite tournaments ever — and they took first place.
After that win, they started playing together regularly, and they’ve been playing together ever since. “We just really clicked. Our personalities are very different, but they mesh really well,” Hassan says, referring to Nick as “the type of person that you see him and you’re like, ‘Oh, I would be friends with this guy.’”
Naturally, it was only a matter of time until Nick got sick of streaming Fortnite. “I think it was a couple months of that, of me just turning the stream on, like ‘All right, here we go again.’” But then Call of Duty: Warzone dropped. “I just got... you know, all gamers, we all have that thing in common. We get addicted to a game because we love it so much. You know what I mean?” Nick says. “We can’t get off it. Close your eyes, you see the game at night.” He was back. “And like a lot of other games in my career, there was some early tournaments for a lot of money, and we fuckin’ popped off, man.” 
Every time I interview Nick for this piece, he’s driving somewhere. Once to see fellow streamer Tim the Tatman (who couldn’t be reached for comment on this piece); the other time, he was on his way to the Super Bowl. He’s kinetic for a guy who plays video games for a living. If you’ll permit me to opine for a second: I think it’s this sense of motion that drives him forward. When he was coming up on the pro circuit, for example, he’d take two-day Greyhounds from Detroit to Dallas just to be able to compete. “I’ve fucking slept in a bathtub before just to be there,” he says. 
And the funny thing is that all this forward motion has blazed a trail for the people behind him. “When I look back on it now, I’m so lucky to say that ‘Listen, you’re looking at the foundation. You’re looking at the groundwork. And I’m happy that you’re here now — great. Welcome,’” he says. “But at the same time, I was here before any of you motherfuckers, man. Did we know it was gonna be like this? Hell no. And if anybody tells you that, I think they’re fucking lying. Because it was just pure passion.” And there aren’t many old heads like Nick left. Some have put their controllers away; some have gotten quote-unquote real jobs.
“I’m a fucking millionaire, right?”
In our last conversation, I ask Nick what gaming has done for him. “The whole ‘done for me’ thing is pretty explanatory,” he says. “I’m a fucking millionaire, right? That’s kind of fuckin’ cool.” And then he changes tack and tells me that not everyone is lucky enough to get to do what they love every day, which is true. But a more revealing answer comes later, as a response to a different question. 
“You’d be fucking wrong if [you thought] I wasn’t competitive in the stream world, too, man,” he says. “I fucking want more viewers. I want more subs. I want to be the best. I want to be the top guy. I think we all do.” The answer, in other words, has been there all along. Gaming allows Nick to be the person he’s always been struggling to become: the guy who wants to compete. The guy who’s gonna beat your ass and let your mom know about it.

The best video game subscription deals right now,https://www.theverge.com/22348957/best-video-game-subscription-playstation-plus-xbox-game-pass-nintendo-switch-online-deals-price-sale,"Wed, 05 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Taylor Lyles

Online game subscriptions are quite common in the gaming industry. Whether it's a subscription for an online service for multiplayer gaming or Netflix-like services that provide access to a massive library of games to play, gaming subscriptions provide good incentives and a lot of value for many gamers. 
While sales tend to stay steady throughout the year, these subscription services will hold promotions or discounts now and then. 
PlayStation Plus is arguably the most popular subscription service available on PlayStation consoles. Subscribing comes with a few perks outside of occasional discounts on the PlayStation Store and playing (most) games online. Each month, Sony provides a rotation of games you can play for free so long as you have an active subscription. If you own a PS5, you have access to the PS Plus Collection, a digital library of “generation-defining games” originally released for the PS4.
A one-year subscription to PlayStation Plus normally retails for $60, but Eneba tends to sell digital keys for US subscribers for less than half of its usual price. Right now, US players can grab a year for $27 by using the offer code VERGEMAYPROMO at checkout. You can even get two years’ worth of service for $54. Otherwise, it is $60 per year at places like Amazon, Best Buy, and GameStop. The service is also available for $10 a month or $25 for three months. 
A membership to PlayStation Plus Essential allows PlayStation 4 and PS5 owners to play games online, download free titles every month, use cloud save backups, and take advantage of discounts on the PS Store.
PlayStation Now is Sony’s cloud gaming service, allowing subscribers to stream games released on the PS2, PS3, and PS4 on their PS4, PS5, and PCs. The service tends to release new games into the library regularly. 
New users can do a seven-day free trial to get a feel for the service. Otherwise, a monthly subscription costs $10, three months of the service in advance costs $25, and a year-long subscription is $60. Eneba has a one-year subscription available for $59, which is $1 off its usual price although Sony recently had a promotion where new subscribers could get one month free of charge. Alternatively, it is $60 at typical retailers, including Amazon and GameStop. 
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is Microsoft’s flagship gaming subscription right now. Subscribing to this service nets you access to Game Pass Console and Game Pass PC. It bundles Xbox Live Gold, a premium online service. Additionally, Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, is included with Game Pass Ultimate. 
You can choose between a monthly plan for $15 or three months for $45. If you are new to Game Pass, you can get your first month for $1, and it will convert to a $15 monthly charge unless you cancel. If you are not a new user of the service but want to renew your subscription for one month only, Eneba is selling a single month for $20. If you want three months but don’t want to be billed automatically, you can grab it for $40 at Amazon or for its usual $45 price tag at GameStop, Newegg, and Walmart.
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers access to more than 100 titles, including the likes of Halo Infinite, Powerwash Simulator, Pentiment, and surprise hits like Hi-Fi Rush, which you can play on Xbox consoles and PC. The pass also gives subscribers access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming. 
Outside of Game Pass Ultimate, Microsoft has two separate versions of the service, including one specifically for Xbox consoles, which is probably the better choice for gamers who solely play on the Xbox and are not interested in the other incentives offered by the Ultimate Tier. Again, you can get this model for $1 if you are new. Otherwise, it’s $10 a month, $60 for six months, or $120 for a full-year subscription. 
Another subscription available on consoles is EA Play, which provides access to a slew of titles published by Electronic Arts. It’s available on a few platforms, including Xbox and PlayStation, but the service is included with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate now. If you are subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate and buy an EA Play subscription, it will convert to a certain number of days or months. 
Nintendo Switch Online is a good service for owners of Nintendo’s hybrid console if they want to do the following: play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, or get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era. It comes in two forms: an individual membership, which provides access and perks through a single account, or a family membership, which provides access to the service via the same or multiple Switch consoles. 
You can get a seven-day free trial for both. Otherwise, an individual membership costs $4 for one month, $8 for three, or $20 for a full year. You can do it directly through Nintendo’s eShop on the Switch itself; retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Humble, GameStop, and Target also sell three-month or one-year subscriptions. The best deal currently is at Eneba, which is selling three months for $6 or a full year for $19.
A premium online service for Nintendo Switch owners, allowing you to play online with friends and access cloud saves in addition to a slate of retro games released in the NES and SNES eras. 
Family Memberships only include a full-year subscription, which you can buy for $35 at Best Buy and the Nintendo eShop.  
Xbox Game Pass for PC is available as a standalone service for those with a gaming PC who do not want all of the perks available with Game Pass Ultimate. Like the console version, Game Pass PC is available for $10 a month or $1 for your first month if you are a new user. Typically, retailers sell the PC-only service for three months, which is normally priced at $30. Currently, Eneba has one month available for $8 or three months for $22. 
Microsoft’s gaming subscription service aimed toward PC gamers. It includes access to the Xbox Game Pass for PC library. 
EA Play is also available on PC, but the prices vary depending on whether you subscribe on Steam or Origin. If you subscribe to Steam, it is the same price as consoles ($5 per month, $30 annually). Origin has EA Play Pro, which costs $15 monthly or $100 per year. The key biggest difference between EA Play and Pro is the Pro version provides unlimited access to the publisher’s latest releases, similar to how Game Pass provides access to Xbox exclusives on the day those titles release. 
Ubisoft Plus (formally UPlay Plus), like EA Play, is a gaming subscription service with a library of games published and developed by Ubisoft. You also receive access to new releases at launch, over 100 games in the library, and Amazon’s Luna and Google’s Stadia cloud gaming services. You can subscribe to a monthly plan, which is $15 each month. 
Ubisoft’s gaming subscription service, which includes access to over 100 titles by the company, such as Assassin’s Creed Valhalla and Watch Dogs: Legion. It also includes access to Amazon Luna and Google Stadia cloud gaming services.
Originally released in 2019, Humble Choice (formerly Humble Monthly) is a Humble Bundle gaming subscription. Each month, the company allows subscribers to choose from a curated list of 10 or more DRM-free games, which they can keep forever. Unlike some other services by the company, all of the games are revealed upfront. It comes in three tiers: Lite ($5 per month), Basic ($15 per month), and Premium ($20 per month). 
Released in 2019, Apple Arcade has its own dedicated tab located on the App Store. It is available on products that run iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS. It costs $5 per month, or you can get a year for just $50. All of the games available on the service are free of in-app purchases and pesky ads and the option to play these games offline. Subscribers can also share access with five other individuals via family sharing. New users can get a one-month free trial. 
Apple’s online gaming subscription service allows users to play games from the library offline. It also includes no advertisements, and you can share your subscription with up to five other people via family sharing. 
Google Play Pass serves as a direct competitor to Apple Arcade and is available on Android devices. It features over 800 apps and games with no ads or in-app purchases. You can subscribe for $5 monthly or $30 annually.

Where to preorder the new black and red DualSense controllers for the PS5,https://www.theverge.com/22434943/where-to-buy-ps5-playstation-5-dualsense-controllers-black-red-price,"Fri, 14 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Brandon Widder, a senior editor overseeing deals, gift guides, and commerce. He spent six years spearheading buying guides and consumer tech coverage at Digital Trends.
If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.
With the PlayStation 5, Sony opted for a less traditional color scheme, one that ditched the classic jet-black exterior found on earlier PlayStation consoles in favor of a black-and-white finish. For some, the new exterior was an acquired taste, as was the matching aesthetic found on the accompanying DualSense controller.
On Thursday, however, the company announced two new color schemes for the DualSense — at least for those lucky enough to have landed a PS5 console amid the ongoing supply shortages. Dubbed “midnight black” and “cosmic red,” both controllers offer the same features as the standard DualSense, including a built-in microphone, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers designed to make games more immersive.  
 Right now, both are currently available for preorder ahead of their launch on June 18th. 
Like the standard DualSense controller, the midnight black DualSense will retail for $69.99 at launch. It’s currently available for preorder at Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, and PlayStation Direct, the latter of which will ship the controller a week ahead of other retailers on June 11th. It’s not an exact match for previous DualShock controllers — the two-tone design features multiple shades of black and subtle gray detailing — but it’s far closer than the current DualSense, which opts for a white-and-black build. If you’ve wrapped your PS5 in Dbrand’s Darkplates, well now you can have a matching controller.
The black DualSense controller sports the same hardware as the original — haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, etc. — only with a two-tone black design reminiscent of PS2, PS3, and PS4 consoles.
According to Sony, the color palette found on the cosmic red DualSense controller is modeled after the various shades of red scattered throughout the cosmos. That added interstellar inspiration will cost you, however, as the cosmic red edition runs a bit pricier at $74.99. It features a two-tone design like the midnight black DualSense, and it’s currently available for preorder at Amazon, Best Buy, GameStop, and PlayStation Direct.
Like the midnight black model, the red-and-black edition is also slated to ship via PlayStation Direct on June 11th, a week ahead of other retailers.
Like the original DualSense controller, the cosmic red model features adaptive triggers and haptic feedback but with a vibrant red-and-black design.

"Elon Musk on Saturday Night Live, explained",https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22421873/elon-musk-snl-jokes-thud-why,"Sat, 08 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg. 
If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.
Who is Elon Musk?
Oh, come on.
Seriously!
Fine. He’s the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, the founder of The Boring Company and Neuralink, a certified member of the PayPal Mafia, and a well-known internet troll.
He sounds rich.
He is. Depending on where the market closes on Friday, he’s either the first or the second richest person in the world. The other contender is Jeff Bezos. A substantial part of both men’s net worth is tied up in their company stock.
Okay. What is Saturday Night Live?
Saturday Night Live is an American television show that has been on the air since 1975. It is in a sketch comedy format. There is usually at least one good sketch in each 90-minute episode, and it is often the digital short.
SNL features a guest host, usually an actor with a movie to promote, and a musical guest, usually promoting a recently released album. After the “cold open,” a topical sketch about current events, the host gives a monologue. 
What is Elon Musk doing on SNL, though?
Selling Teslas and getting richer.
Musk’s sales acumen is a running theme in Ashlee Vance’s biography of him and in the lore Musk loves to promote about himself: arbitraging Easter eggs with his cousins, running a nightclub out of his frat house, writing a computer program at age 12 and sending it to PC Magazine for $500. A major component of sales, of course, is advertising, and the most powerful form of advertising is “earned media,” or mentions you don’t have to pay for. You know, like the kind you get by guest-hosting Saturday Night Live.
Tesla famously doesn’t do paid advertisements. It doesn’t need to. Appearing on PewDiePie’s Meme Review is free. So is getting papped in a Cybertruck at Nobu. So is squiring musician Grimes to the Met Gala. Parties for people who own Teslas, Boring Company Flamethrowers, or who are just big fans have been part of his promotional efforts for years. He has a spicy Twitter account — spicy enough to earn Jack Dorsey’s endorsement and piss off the Securities and Exchange Commission — and his tweets often make headlines. This is to say nothing of the infamous Joe Rogan blunt-smoking episode.
This isn’t Musk’s first foray into Hollywood, either. He was an executive producer of Thank You for Smoking. He’s also appeared in Rick and Morty, Big Bang Theory, South Park, The Simpsons, and Iron Man 2. 
Most CEOs don’t do this. Tesla gets compared to Apple a lot, and I would like you, for lols, to just visualize Tim Cook appearing on Joe Rogan’s show at all. Okay. Can you even see him drinking whiskey? He’s certainly not gonna pass that dutch. Steve Jobs appeared in only one movie, a 1988 documentary about Bruce Springsteen.
SNL promises to be an hour and a half of Elon-friendly writing, with goofs that burnish his reputation and let him laugh at himself. Plus, he gets to remind everyone Tesla exists and basically re-created the electric car market at a time when a lot of his competitors have jumped into EVs. My only real unanswered question about this is: Why isn’t the musical guest Grimes, tho?
Do you think he’ll pump Dogecoin?
I mean, yes, probably? One hedge fund made very good returns on the GameStonk debacle by selling immediately after Elon Musk pumped GameStop, so that’s something to consider.
Is Tesla involved in Dogecoin?
Not as far as I know, and I love reading their financial documents. Tesla is involved, however, in bitcoin. You can even buy a Tesla with bitcoin.
Why has Elon gotten involved in Dogecoin and GameStonk?
They’re popular online, and he, famously, loves memes — even if he often arrives at them late.
It also seems like he really wants to be liked. Musk has spent a lot of time courting an online fan base — some of his media appearances, like on Rick and Morty and Meme Review, seem designed to appeal to that fan base. While those fans may or may not convert into actual Tesla purchases, they help keep Musk relevant and are useful in hassling his critics online. 
Okay, but what matters more to Musk, money or popularity?
Ahahahaha you are asking me to read Elon Musk’s mind? Fine, great, hold on, let me concentrate. I see… an army of angry squirrels.
No, seriously, though — Musk has been consistent about his admiration for humorists. He considered buying The Onion’s parent company in 2014 but ultimately didn’t put in a bid. Later, he funded a humor effort called Thud, which he briefly suggested would be part of his “intergalactic media empire.” Thud crashed and burned shortly after it launched.
Judging by his past beef with the SEC and his history with Thud, which was never meant to make money, I would argue the thing that matters most to Musk is neither money nor popularity. It’s his ability to do whatever he damn pleases. Arguably, that’s part of what makes him popular — popular enough to host SNL, even. Now the question is, will he send the ratings to the Moon?

"In Epic v Apple, everybody is losing at the game of defining games",https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5,"Fri, 07 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",The Verge,"By  Elizabeth Lopatto, a reporter who writes about tech, money, and human behavior. She joined The Verge in 2014 as science editor. Previously, she was a reporter at Bloomberg. 
If you have ever wanted to see a bunch of mumbly nerds struggle to define what constitutes a “game,” well, is Epic v. Apple the trial for you!
What is the difference between an “app” and a “game?” This sounds like a stoner question but instead occupied a fair amount of the morning in Epic v. Apple. Roblox, explained Apple’s marketing manager Trystan Kosmynka, was an app. See, games have a beginning, an end, and challenges. “There’s experiences within Roblox that we did not look at as a game,” Kosmynka said. We did establish that Minecraft is a game, though, so that’s nice for Microsoft.
Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers did not understand this distinction and neither did I. But here’s the problem for Apple: if Roblox is a game, then it’s fairly easy for Epic to compare Fortnite to it. Also, looking up Roblox in the App Store after Kosmynka testified, it is categorized as a “game.” 
Roblox is free, with in-app purchases. Since apparently no one can define what a game is, I can’t tell whether it’s fair to say that Roblox is a platform with games on it, but it sure looks that way when I log on. Scrolling through, there are a number of small squares where I can join a game, and each appears to have different rules. (The app calls these “worlds.”) 
And when Kosmynka doesn’t get the category on Roblox right, well. That’s an own goal.
“I’ve always looked at Fortnite as a game.”
Anyway, Kosmynka noticeably shrank when Epic’s Lauren Moskowitz began asking questions on the redirect. Were Snapchat’s bunny ear filters games? What about TikTok challenges? (The manner in which this question was asked convinced me that I was possibly the only person in the room on TikTok.) Things got worse for Kosmynka during a speed-run of questions. Had he used Fortnite? Yes. Had he attended a concert there? No. “Fortnite is a virtual world where you build a character, correct?”
“I wouldn’t refer to Fortnite as a world. I’ve always looked at Fortnite as a game,” Kosmynka replied. Had he done Battle Royale? Yes. Party Royale? No. Creative mode? No. He knew that Fortnite held concerts but didn’t know it streamed movies. In the context of “What is a game,” it made Kosmynka sound like he didn’t know what he was talking about. It was a tense, and rather devastating, line of questioning.
At one point, Judge Gonzalez Rogers said she didn’t understand why Minecraft was a game and Roblox was not. (Again, per the App Store: Roblox is absolutely a game.) She asked Kosmynka for an industry definition for a game. Turns out, there isn’t one — although, my colleague Adi Robertson notes, game developers and academics will happily talk you under the table about magic circles, meaningful choices, and the works of Johan Huizinga if you ask.
It seemed like Epic was attempting to establish that Apple is inconsistent
Later, Matthew Weissinger, VP of marketing at Epic Games, explained that Fortnite is a metaverse. “It’s one of the remarkable things about Fortnite, we’re building this thing called the metaverse, a social place,” he murmured softly. (All of the men we heard from today would benefit greatly from elocution lessons.) “One of the ways I’ve tried to explain it is, think about all of us in lockdown, and how we try to stay socially connected. Some of the most meaningful experiences I’ve had were logging into Zoom and we had our friends and parents and we celebrate grandpa’s birthday.”
We also discover that Roblox has a “battle royale” mode, just like Fortnite. Honestly the question to me now is not Is Roblox a game but Is Roblox a metaverse. 
Throughout this line of questioning, it seemed like Epic was attempting to establish that Apple is inconsistent — and passing the buck. Kosmynka testified that developers get to pick what category they belong to, not Apple, making his Roblox digression even weirder. The Roblox thing made Apple look slipshod, and the further testimony about the App Store review didn’t help.
The process behind App Store review is unbelievably boring unless you are a developer who is trying to pass review. We went through it in exhaustive detail. Apple gets 100,000 app store submissions per week, Kosmynka testified. But only 500 people actually do the “human review” — a lot of the rest of the work is automated. It’s impossible to judge how good an automated process is by listening to someone describe it in abstract in the courtroom. Kosmynka seemed confident when he was being questioned by Apple’s attorney, but when Epic got a crack at him, his voice got softer and softer.
“One of the problems with limiting competition is that you don’t get innovation.”
We heard about apps Apple had mistakenly allowed on the store: ones that carried malicious ad fraud code, apps that copycatted Headspace, a “school shooting game,” a game of shooting cannons at protestors, several inappropriate apps (the funniest of which was “Ganja Farm: Weed Empire”) and more. In emails, Kosmynka said, “We are making critical errors.” In reference to the school-shooting game, Kosmynka said he was “dumbfounded at how this could be missed.” These specifics were more damning than the abstract walk-through of the app review process.
At one point, Judge Gonzalez Rogers wondered if anyone was doing better than Apple at app store moderation. Kosmynka punted on this answer. “One of the problems with limiting competition is that you don’t get innovation,” said Judge Gonzalez Rogers. “One of my concerns is that if you aren’t letting parties compete on these topics, things won’t improve.” She then asked if Apple hired third party reviewers. It does not.
There is an implicit contrast here — the Epic Games Store. Steve Allison, VP and General Manager of the Epic Game Store, testified that there have been no known instances of malware or pirated content on the Epic Game Store, though there has been some fraud. It was hard not to notice the contrast. 
Apple’s lawyer, who did not introduce herself, took us through an excruciating narration of the Epic Games website as part of her intensely chaotic cross-examination of Allison. I understand that a lot of things need to be narrated for the court record, but this was silly. We determined that there were a lot of games in the Epic Games Store. We also determined that there were 25 games in the “top 20” games section, which felt kind of bitchy. The first non-game app, Spotify, came to the store in December 2020. Fine, but this didn’t seem to make Epic look bad? Or at least, not the way she’d been hoping.
“Are you aware that itch.io includes so-called adult games such as a game called “Sisterly Lust?”
She lingered on the store-within-a-store on Epic Game Store: Itch.io,a store for indie games that Epic added to its store in April. You can download itch.io’s store from Epic. “Are you aware that itch.io includes so-called adult games such as a game called “Sisterly Lust?” Apple’s lawyer asked. Some of the games on itch.io are “so offensive we cannot speak about them here,” she sniffed. This was a more successful line of argument — it essentially explained why Apple didn’t want stores within its own store.
Of course, the big contrast between the Apple App Store and the Epic Game Store was economic. The 30/70 split that Epic finds so objectionable began with retail — you used to have to buy games at Wal-Mart or GameStop or something, when they were physically packaged, Allison said quietly. As retailers moved away from PC games in favor of console games, Valve created Steam, which mimicked the 30/70 split from traditional retail — but it was viewed as an improvement among developers, since they didn’t have to pay for discs and packaging and so on.
That is, until Minecraft self-published, in Allison’s telling. Then someone taking 30 percent looked steep. In 2018, Epic launched the Epic Games Store, which took only a 12 percent cut. (In order to assuage developers who might fear losing revenue from Steam when they took exclusive deals with Epic, Epic agreed to pay them a minimum guarantee.)
Significantly, developers don’t have to use the Epic in-app payment system — they can use their own, meaning that Epic can theoretically get no money on in-app purchases. Wizards of the Coast, the publisher of Magic the Gathering Arena, and Ubisoft, with multiple titles, use their own payment systems.
Still, I find myself returning to the question that began the day: What is a game? It’s shocking to me that so many people who specialize in apps and games can’t really answer this question. But I guess in some sense, you could imagine the trial is one — it’s got a beginning, a middle, and an end. Lots of money at stake. A winner and a loser. Plus, when the verdict is appealed — as it almost inevitably will be — we’ll get a sequel. Sure, Epic played well today, but you need more than one good turn to win.
