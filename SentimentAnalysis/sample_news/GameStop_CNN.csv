How Trumpism explains the GameStop stock surge,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/27/politics/gamestop-stock-surge-trumpism/index.html,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            At the core of Donald Trump’s angry populist appeal was – and is – this sentiment: The elites think they know better than you. They think they can tell you how to live and what to believe. But guess what? We the people are smarter than the elites!


            Trump elucidated this argument in its purest form at a rally in North Dakota in 2018 when he went on this riff:
    

“I meet these people they call them ‘the elite.’ These people. I look at them, I say, ‘That’s elite?’ We got more money, we got more brains, we got better houses, apartments, we got nicer boats, we’re smarter than they are, and they say they’re elite? We’re the elite. You’re the elite. We’re the elite.”


“So I said the other day, let’s keep calling these people—and let’s face it, they’ve been stone-cold losers, the elite, the elite—so let them keep calling themselves the elite. But we’re going to call ourselves—and remember you are indeed, you work harder, but you are indeed smarter than them—let’s call ourselves from now on the super-elite. We’re the super-elite.”

            What made Trump’s argument so potent, politically speaking, is that he wasn’t just calling out the elites. He was saying that Average Joes needed to rise up and actually show them how wrong they were – that voting him for him was the best way to express their anger and frustration with the condescension of their alleged bettors. Donald Trump offered himself up as a collective middle finger to the elites. And he won.
    

            All of which brings me to the current – seemingly inexplicable – stock surge of GameStop, the video-game seller that has made its money over the years thanks to its locations in malls.
    

            The origins of the surge are in the prevalent belief among Wall Street sharps – professional investors – that GameStop’s stock, even before this recent spike, was overvalued. After all, shopping malls are in a long decline – “Malls are doomed: 25% will be gone in 5 years,” read a CNN headline in 2017 – that has only been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. 
    

            As a result of the belief among the pro investor crowd that GameStop was, essentially, doomed, they began shorting the stock – essentially betting on it to fail. This happens all the time to a variety of stocks with very little fanfare. It is the way of the modern stock market.
    

            Except that this time, amateur investors decided to revolt against the pros. Using Reddit – and a subreddit known as r/wallstreetbets – the amateurs began a coordinated effort of buying GameStop stock to drive its price higher and higher. (It’s worth noting that Reddit was also a gathering spot for some of the most ardent Trump supporters in 2016.)
    

            That effort to screw the pros – people with a short position on a stock that is surging have major vulnerabilities the higher the stock goes – got an unexpected boost from none other than iconoclast-in-chief and Tesla founder Elon Musk, who tweeted “Gamestonk!” with a link to the “wallstreetbets” subreddit on Tuesday.
    

            (Musk has also been a longtime critic of social media censoring and was a prominent Covid-19 skeptic. Sound like anyone else we know?)
    

            And there’s no question that the populist revolt has worked for GameStop stock. On December 28, it was trading at $20.99 a share. On Wednesday, it was a shade under $335 a share.

            What’s the end game for the GameStop surgers? Like, now that they have proven the point that they can take a stock that the pros have declared moribund and revive it – at least for a moment – what do they do now? Because they don’t really believe that GameStop is suddenly the new Amazon or Apple or Google. It’s still mostly a business that derives its value from brick and mortar stores in malls. Which, again, is not exactly a big growth area in the coming years.
    

            The point is that there is no real point beyond showing up the pros – proving to them that they aren’t as smart as they think they are and that they don’t have the ability to control everything.
    

            Which, again, has its roots in Trumpism. The entire notion of Trump’s candidacy and presidency was to stick it to the elites. And then, well, uh, there wasn’t really a plan beyond that. The screwjob was the point. (Montreal screwjob reference!)
    

            That strategy – if that is even a word that can be associated with what this is – has massive limits. Sticking it to the man will only get you so far. It’s not a solution to any problem. It’s just a way to express frustration, anger and a feeling of helplessness.
    

            Think of it this way: Giving someone the finger might make you feel good in the moment. But it doesn’t solve anything.

            Hot Stocks 




            GameStop is expected to lose money this year and next year. Sales growth is sluggish as fewer gamers need to go to stores — or even shop online — when they can download new titles directly from their consoles, PCs, phones or tablets.  So why are shares of the video game retailer up more than 275% so far in 2021?
    

            The company can thank a loyal group of investors on Reddit who continue to back the stock even as many others on Wall Street have argued that the shares are overvalued and due for a sharp decline. 
    

            The stock was extremely volatile on Monday, and it was halted several times. Shares more than doubled at one point, and finished the day 18% higher.
    

            Posters on the WallStreetBets subreddit have been touting the company aggressively. That appears to have helped fuel a so-called short squeeze in GameStop
            
                (GME) stock. 
    

            A large number of investors have bet against GameStop recently by borrowing shares and selling them with the hopes that they can then repurchase the stock at a lower price and pocket the difference.
    

            That’s a risky strategy: If a stock suddenly spikes higher, short sellers may have to rush en masse to buy back shares or risk losing their shirts. The more that a shorted stock goes up, the bigger the losses become if a short seller doesn’t buy back (or cover) their position. That creates the squeeze.

Why stocks that investors love to bet against often go up -- a lot 


Citron Research, an investing firm that often identifies stocks it thinks are overvalued and therefore could be good short-selling candidates, has learned the hard way what can happen when investors squeeze a stock higher. 
    

            Citron founder Andrew Left called GameStop a “failing mall-based retailer” in a report earlier this month and then predicted that the stock would plunge to $20 in a video he posted to Twitter on Thursday. At the time, GameStop was trading around $40. The stock surged to $65 by Friday and is now trading around $100. 
    

            Left has now given up on shorting GameStop, citing harassment by the stock’s backers.
    

            He also tweeted last week that “too many people” were hacking Citron’s Twitter feed, causing him to delay the posting of his video, which was originally planned for Wednesday. Left was not immediately available for further comment.
    

            The victory for GameStop’s vocal bulls on Reddit shows how dangerous it is for investors to bet against stocks that have a significant cult following. BlackBerry
            
                (BB), another favorite among Reddit’s WSB followers, has also surged this year.  
    

            Some gleeful GameStop investors are even looking to cash in by selling merchandise touting the stock rally. 
    

            JonesTrading chief market strategist Mike O’Rourke noted in a report Monday that there is now a commemorative patch listed on Etsy that celebrates the GameStop stock spike. More than 100 have been sold so far.

Is the stock market in a bubble? The debate is heating up


            To be sure, GameStop does have some upside beyond the Reddit love.
    

            Despite its name, the retailer doesn’t sell only games. GameStop is also popular with fans of pop culture collectibles, such as Star Wars toys and Funko
            
                (FNKO) figurines, which help attract shoppers who aren’t hardcore gamers to visit the brick and mortar shops. 
    

            GameStop announced earlier this month that same-store sales rose nearly 5% during the 2020 holiday season and that digital sales skyrocketed more than 300%. 
    

            Overall sales were still down though, due primarily to temporary store closures as a result of a spike in Covid-19 cases in December as well as supply disruptions due to strong demand for new PS5 and Xbox Series X.consoles from Sony
            
                (SNE) and Microsoft
            
                (MSFT).
    

            GameStop had no comment for this story, but the firm is making some changes as it attempts to become a more digitally-focused retailer.
    

            The company announced earlier this month that Ryan Cohen, founder of online pet supply store Chewy, is now on GameStop’s board along with two other former Chewy executives. Cohen’s RC Ventures is one of the largest investors in GameStop. 
    

            “The three new directors collectively bring deep expertise in e-commerce, online marketing, finance and strategic planning to GameStop,” the company said in a press release about the board moves.

            Still, some investing experts are worried that the rise in GameStop has gone too far too fast and could be yet another sign of speculative mania in what has suddenly become a frothy overall market.
    

            “Generally speaking, stocks with high short interest have been some of the top performers this year,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group in a report earlier this month. 
    

            The Bespoke report also noted that struggling retailer Bed Bath & Beyond
            
                (BBBY), mall owner Macerich
            
                (MAC) and hard hit movie theater operator AMC
            
                (AMC) are other examples of heavily shorted stocks that are up substantially in 2021.

            Melvin Capital, a premier Wall Street hedge fund entangled in the frenzy over GameStop
            
                (GME), lost 53% in January, a source familiar with the matter told CNN Business. 
    

            Melvin, a major short-seller of GameStop, bet that the company’s shares would drop. But, on January 11, GameStop announced new board members who could help it with digital sales. That set off a fury on Reddit, namely subreddit WallStreetBets, which catapulted GameStop’s stock more than 1,600%.
    

            Hedge funds like Melvin with huge short positions in GameStop and other stocks targeted by WallStreetBets got burned. The Reddit group specifically targeted stocks that were heavily shorted. At one point, GameStop had more short interest than shares on the market.
    

            The Wall Street Journal first reported Melvin’s losses.
    

            Melvin Capital was founded by Gabe Plotkin, and it started the year with roughly $12.5 billion in assets. It ended the month with more than $8 billion after receiving commitments from current investors for more capital in the final days of the month, the source said. 
    

            Last week, Citadel, a hedge fund owned by billionaire Ken Griffin, provided the firm with a more-than-$2-billion bailout.
    

            “The fund’s portfolio liquidity is strong,” the source said. “Use of leverage is at the lowest level since Melvin Capital’s inception in 2014.”
    

            Melvin found itself at the heart of the GameStop saga after Robinhood suspended trading of the stock and several others Thursday. The move was followed by an onslaught of backlash from individual investors, such as those from Reddit, who felt Robinhood was giving into pressures from Wall Street and the requests of hedge fund managers.
    

            The frustration from Robinhood users was soon followed by a class-action lawsuit against the stock-trading app for its decision of restricting trading of stocks like GameStop.

            There was a lot to unpack in the deluge of news this week about GameStop, the stock market, Reddit groups, trading apps and hedge funds. If it all seemed like too much, we can’t blame you for tuning out.
    

            While we don’t know just how the so-called Reddit rebellion will change the future of investing, it’s safe to say Wall Street will never be the same. 
    

            Here are five key things you need to know about Wall Street’s wild week. 
    

            At the heart of the GameStop saga is a struggle between two drastically different groups of investors: A band of amateur day traders versus a bunch of Wall Street pros known as short-sellers.

Inside the Reddit army that's crushing Wall Street


            The Davids, in this case, are the mostly young day traders who congregate on the Reddit page WallStreetBets — aka the Reddit army, or the Reddit mob, depending on your point of view. “They have seen the rich get extremely rich by taking advantage of cheap money, and they want to get their piece as well,” said Richard Fisher, the former president of the Dallas Federal Reserve. 
    

            Their mission has two main goals: Drive up stock prices to score profits for themselves, and at the same time, force the establishment investors to abandon bearish bets against struggling companies such as GameStop
            
                (GME), AMC
            
                (AMC), Macy’s
            
                (M) and several others.
    

            The Goliaths are mostly hedge funds who are shorting those stocks — in other words, big-shot investors placing bets that those shares will crash. They are also the Wall Street elite upon whom millions of investors rely to make smart decisions to boost their portfolios. But working in an industry associated with the house-of-cards system that created the 2008 financial crisis, these giants are not exactly beloved. Posts on the WallStreetBets subreddit openly relish watching short-sellers lose billions of dollars. 
    

            The WallStreetBets community, which now boasts some 5 million followers, has been around since 2012. Describing itself as if “4chan found a Bloomberg terminal,” the forum’s giddy nihilism, inscrutable language and acerbic memes have fueled a war on a perceived corrupted mainstream.
    

            The group noticed that GameStop, the struggling brick-and-mortar video game retailer, was heavily shorted by hedge funds. (The consensus on Wall Street seemed to be that GameStop would soon go the way of Blockbuster.)
    

            Reddit investors took a different view from the short-sellers, however, and began buying up shares of the company that they believed were undervalued. 
    

            Although it had been building for a while, the rally really took off on Monday, January 11, when GameStop announced three new directors would join its board, including Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen. Investors liked that Cohen brought digital experience to the table, something GameStop desperately needs, as video games go digital and malls continue their unrelenting slump into irrelevance.
    

            GameStop’s stock rose a little less than 13% that day. But this wasn’t a normal, momentary stock surge. Two days later, it rose 57%. Then 27%…and so on. The Reddit crowd also drove huge jumps in AMC, BlackBerry, Macy’s and other stocks that were heavily shorted.
    

            As of Friday, GameStop’s stock was up a jaw-dropping 1,587% since the beginning of January. 
    

            For perspective: One year ago, a single share cost about $4. It’s now about $150.

Analysis: Hedge funds bitching about Reddit can cry me a river  


            The surge ultimately had little or nothing to do with GameStop’s strength as a business. As investors following the Reddit group bought a ton of GameStop options, short-sellers were forced to buy shares to cover their losing bids — thus boosting the share price even further. This is what’s known as a short squeeze. 
    

            Millions of people, including Elon Musk, chimed in. 
    

            It quickly became “a populist uprising armed with no-fee brokerage accounts instead of pitchforks,” as CNN’s Christine Romans put it. And the only ones crying foul were the “sophisticated” Wall Street players.
    

            “The irony is delicious,” Romans writes. “An online flash mob beats Wall Street insiders at their own game.”
    

            On Tuesday, GameStop was the most traded stock on the planet. Then Robinhood crashed the party. 
    

            Thursday morning, citing extreme volatility, the free trading app favored by millions of amateur investors suspended trading of the red-hot Reddit darlings. That left the WSB crowd with just two options: hold or sell. Meanwhile institutional investors, who don’t need Robinhood to execute trades, were able to carry on. 
    

            GameStop shares lost more than 44% of their value on Thursday after surging nearly 40% at one point earlier in the day. 
    

            The backlash was swift. Those who’d been minting money on their GameStop stock positions were, to put it mildly, furious. The consensus on social media seemed to be that Robinhood, which built its brand on “democratizing” investing, appeared to be caving to pressure from powerful institutions on Wall Street.

Class-action lawsuit filed against Robinhood following outrage over GameStop stock restriction


            Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the decision “unacceptable.” One Reddit user swiftly filed a class-action lawsuit, claiming Robinhood rigged the market against its customers. 
    

            Robinhood relented Thursday night, saying it would resume “limited” buys on the stocks the next day. It also tapped $1 billion in cash from its private investors, signaling it was short on cash. 
    

            On Friday morning, the GameStop euphoria was back. The stock opened up roughly 100%. 
    

            There’s an argument to be made that GameStop was undervalued, but hardly anyone believes that GameStop, BlackBerry, Macy’s, AMC or any of the other companies that the Reddit crowd is promoting have the fundamentals to support such sky-high prices. At some point, reality will set in.
    

            But that’s the problem with bubbles — get out too early, and you lose at a chance to cash out on top. So GameStop keeps surging … until it doesn’t.
    

            “Someone is going to get hurt,” said Fisher, the former Dallas Fed president. “As happens with crowd behavior, you end up having people come in at the end at a very high price and getting burned.”
    

            The Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency that regulates Wall Street, said it will “closely review” actions by trading platforms to restrict transactions.

            Hot Stocks 




            Robinhood received a startling 3:30 am call from its clearinghouse during last week’s Reddit-inspired market chaos asking for the free-trading app to put up a staggering $3 billion, co-CEO Vlad Tenev said Monday. 
    

            “This was obviously nerve-wracking,” Tenev told Tesla
            
                (TSLA) boss Elon Musk during an interview on the platform Clubhouse.
    

            For context, Robinhood had raised only $2 billion in total venture capital funding up until that point. That’s why the trading app had to draw down its credit lines last week. 
    

            And that’s why Robinhood announced Monday it has raised an additional $2.4 billion from investors. That is in addition to a $1 billion capital raise announced last week. The fact that Robinhood has felt the need to raise massive sums in such a short time underscores the intense financial pressure facing the company.
    

            Whenever investors buy stocks, brokerages like Robinhood must make a deposit first at a clearinghouse. But Tenev said the $3 billion ask was “an order of magnitude” larger than what Robinhood is typically required by the National Securities Clearing Corporation to put up.

            The $3.4 billion capital raise came in the form of debt, specifically a convertible note, a person familiar with the matter told CNN Business. 
    

            The fact that Robinhood went this route instead of selling equity is another signal of the severe financial pressure facing the startup because of Reddit-inspired market turmoil. A convertible note, a common way early-stage companies raise money, is a type of bond that can be converted to common stock.
    

            Cash-strapped private companies sometimes choose this option because it delays the need to establish a new value for the company. Admitting that a startup’s valuation has gone down can cause negative publicity. And Robinhood’s valuation would have likely been pressured by the turmoil of the past week.
    

            Last week, Robinhood outraged users and lawmakers by prohibiting purchases of GameStop
            
                (GME), AMC
            
                (AMC) and other favorites of WallStreetBets, the Reddit group that disrupted parts of financial markets. Hours later, Robinhood raised $1 billion from existing investors in a move that signaled a cash crunch. 
    

            “We had no choice in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory requirements. The team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers,” said Tenev, who said he was asleep at the time of the early morning call from NSCC on Thursday.
    

            But the decision later on that day to restrict trading also damaged Robinhood’s brand — because the startup has long said its mission is to democratize investing. Some users threatened to quit the app, while Robinhood faced bipartisan calls for investigations in Congress. 
    

            After huddling with his senior executives, Tenev said they persuaded the clearinghouse to lower its request for capital from $3 billion to $1.4 billion.
    

            “We were making some progress, but it’s still a high number,” Tenev said.
    

            During the interview, Musk commented that it “seems weird” that Robinhood suddenly received such a large request from its clearinghouse.
    

            “I wouldn’t impute shadiness to it or anything like that,” Tenev said, adding that NSCC was “reasonable” and “worked with us” to lower the deposit request. “It was unprecedented activity.”

            Indeed, shares of GameStop, AMC and other stocks favored by short-sellers skyrocketed last week after being targeted by WallStreetBets. Some hedge funds that took bearish positions in those stocks endured staggering losses and needed to get bailed out. The market action may have been amplified by other hedge funds and financial players who rode the WallSteetBets wave.


            The Robinhood co-CEO also addressed why traders on the app could sell shares of GameStop, but not buy them.
    

            “People get really pissed off if they are holding stock and they can’t sell it,” Tenev explained.
    

            Of course, they also get angry if they want to buy a stock but can’t.
    

Robinhood announced Sunday that it will further lift restrictions on stock trades — but not entirely. For instance, Robinhood users are able to buy only one share of GameStop and 10 shares of AMC.  
    

            The $3.4 billion round of funding was led by Ribbit Capital and include existing investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia. 
    

            “This funding is a strong sign of confidence from investors and will help us build for the future and continue to serve people through the exponential growth we’ve seen this year,” Robinhood said in a blog post. 
    

            Tenev again denied speculation that its decision to cut off buys of GameStop was aimed at pleasing entities controlled by billionaire Ken Griffin. 
    

            “That’s just false,” he said.
    

            Earlier this week, Citadel, the massive hedge fund owned by Griffin, provided a $2 billion bailout to GameStop short-seller Melvin Capital Management. Melvin Capital had bet that GameStop shares would drop — and the hedge fund was crushed when the opposite happened.
    

            Citadel Securities, the market maker also owned by Griffin, is a major source of revenue for Robinhood. Like other brokerages, Robinhood gets paid to route orders to market makers, a controversial practice known as payment for order flow.
    

            Last week, representatives for Citadel Securities and the Citadel hedge fund denied any role in Robinhood’s decision to halt purchases of GameStop.
    

            Musk asked Tenev if Citadel would have had a say in who was put in charge of the clearinghouse that requested the $3 billion deposit. 
    

            “I don’t have any reason to believe that,” Tenev said. “You’re getting into the conspiracy theories a little bit.”

            A Robinhood customer filed a class-action lawsuit against the stock-trading app Thursday after the company barred traders from buying shares of GameStop promoted by WallStreetBets, a popular Reddit group for investors.
    

            The lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York, claims that Robinhood’s actions rigged the market against its customers.
    

            “Robinhood’s actions were done purposefully and knowingly to manipulate the market for the benefit of people and financial institutions who were not Robinhood’s customers,” the lawsuit states.
    

            Robinhood did not respond to a request for comment. The company imposed the stock-trading restrictions Thursday citing “recent volatility.”  The company said in a blog post it will only allow users to close out their positions in those stocks, which include GameStop
            
                (GME), AMC
            
                (AMC), Bed Bath & Beyond
            
                (BBBY), and Nokia
            
                (NOK). 
    

            Following the decision Thursday, shares of GameStop fluctuated wildly.
    

            The lawsuit claims Robinhood’s decision deprived retail investors of potential gains they could have made by buying when the stock was low and selling when its price rose.

WallStreetBets founder on stock frenzy: I'm enjoying this from the sidelines


            GameStop’s stock has soared since January 11 after it hired several new board members that investors believed could help the stock boost its digital sales. Reddit’s WallStreetBets group began promoting the stock, sending it soaring more than 1,000% over the past several weeks. 
    

            The stock’s surge forced short-sellers who were betting against the stock to buy shares to hedge their positions, sending the stock soaring even higher.  
    

            Many day traders took advantage of Robinhood’s free trades, placing bets on GameStop and other stocks the Reddit group promoted. But those customers are playing a dangerous game. The companies’ fundamentals don’t support such elevated stock prices, and the bubble could burst, wiping out the traders who had placed big bets on GameStop and the like.
    

            “We’re committed to helping our customers navigate this uncertainty,” the company said in a statement. “We fundamentally believe that everyone should have access to financial markets.”
    

            Robinhood published another blog post Thursday afternoon saying it would “allow limited buys of these” stocks starting Friday.
    

            Following Robinhood’s decision earlier Thursday morning, Redditors stood up a new forum, r/ClassActionRobinHood, to coordinate efforts for a lawsuit. It collected more than 31,000 users Thursday.
    

            One law firm that Redditors have engaged with is ChapmanAlbin LLC, based in Cleveland, Ohio, which specializes in investments and financial fraud. The firm’s homepage currently has a prompt titled, “Are you a Robinhood user who has suffered losses?” along with a way for people to submit information. 
    

            The firm has collected information from more than 6,000 people as it investigates Robinhood, attorney Philip Vujanov told CNN.
    

            “This is pretty unprecedented, I’ve never heard of another scenario like this,” Vujanov told CNN in a phone interview. “There’s going to be a lot of people left holding the bag.”
    

            Vujanov specifically called Robinhood’s actions today “disingenuous” while citing a tweet from Robinhood’s official Twitter account in March 2016 that stated, “Let the people trade.”
    

            “Now, all of a sudden, they are changing their position,” Vujanov said regarding Robinhood.
    

            One avid Wallstreetbets user dismayed over Robinhood’s decision was Christopher Kardatzke, 21, a recent college graduate who, along with his brother, have developed free financial software  used by Redditors to guide their investment strategy.
    

            “It seems a bit silly. The people of r/wallstreetbets were buying up GameStop and playing a game of Jenga, but it’s the same game that hedge funds have been playing for decades and decades,” Kardatzke said. “It’s a bit ridiculous.”
    

            This sentiment was echoed on Capitol Hill where Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz were among a group of lawmakers to chastise Robinhood’s decision.
    

            “We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp’s decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit,” tweeted Ocasio-Cortez.
    

            In a subsequent tweet, Ocasio-Cortez said she will be on Twitch tonight to discuss GameStop and today’s developments.
    

  CNN’s Brian Fung, Alexis Benveniste, and Matt Egan contributed to this report.

            Hot Stocks 




            GameStop mania didn’t happen in a vacuum. It’s just the most glaring example of the bubble-like behavior running rampant in the financial markets. 
    

            Long before an army of Reddit traders sent GameStop, AMC
            
                (AMC) and other stocks “to the moon,” evidence of extreme market speculation had been mounting. 
    

            Shares of Airbnb, DoorDash and other unprofitable start ups have gone straight up on their first day of trading. Shell companies with no operating assets have raised gobs of money thanks to a phenomenon known as SPAC mania. Tesla is now worth nearly $800 billion – 
            
                more than every other major automaker combined. 


            None of this is normal. Rock-bottom interest rates are forcing investors to take extraordinary risks – and for some, this will end badly. 
    

        It’s going to be extra humiliating when the bubble pops.” 
    

        economist Robert Shiller
    

            “I think we’ve had a bubble for some time. This is just icing on the cake,” Richard Fisher, the former president of the Dallas Federal Reserve, told CNN Business. “When things get out of control like this, it is a sign that you should be very worried.”
    

            GameStop
            
                (GME) has skyrocketed about 1,700% this year as traders on the Reddit board WallStreetBets helped push it sharply higher – and that’s after losing nearly half its value Thursday. The CEO of the money-losing video game retailer is now worth nearly $1 billion.

            “Someone is going to get hurt,” Fisher said. “As happens with crowd behavior, you end up having people come in at the end at a very high price and getting burned.”
    

            Indeed, the SEC warned Thursday that “extreme stock price volatility” has the potential to cause “rapid and severe losses” for investors and to undermine market confidence. 
    

            Robert Shiller, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, said the Reddit movement is being driven by not just historically low interest rates, but by social trends, too. 
    

            “It has something to do with Trumpism,” Shiller told CNN Business. “There is a pass-it-on mentality. A sense that ‘those experts are just self-important; they don’t know anything.’”
    

            He added that there is a desire to outsmart those experts and prove them wrong.
    

            “I can imagine that story being contagious at this time in history,” Shiller said. “It’s going to be extra humiliating when the bubble pops.” 
    

            Fisher, the Dallas Fed president and a former hedge fund manager, agrees there is a social dynamic and hint of populism at play. 
    

            “They have seen the rich get extremely rich by taking advantage of cheap money – and they want to get their piece as well,” Fisher said. “This is sign that we are getting a blow-off top.”
    

            FOMO (fear of missing out) has helped drive an enormous amount of money into bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. There remains a massive divide over the future of bitcoin, but establishment figures such as BlackRock are increasingly voicing support – and throwing money behind it.
    

            Yet bitcoin can at times move dramatically for reasons that may seem dubious. The leading cryptocurrency surged 20% early Friday, for example, after Tesla boss Elon Musk added the hashtag #bitcoin to his Twitter bio.

            Meanwhile, special purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, are all the rage. Once reserved for the back waters of Wall Street, major companies including Virgin Galactic, DraftKings and Playboy are all going or have gone public through SPACs. 
    

            Collectively SPACs have raised $16 billion during the first three weeks of 2021 alone, easily surpassing the $13 billion that was raised in all of 2019, according to Goldman Sachs. In 2020, 229 SPACs raised a staggering $76 billion.
    

            “Bubble-like sentiment surrounds SPACs,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a recent research report. 
    

            Fisher agreed that SPAC mania is another concerning sign. 
    

            “What you’re doing is throwing money out there – and hoping to find an idea,” he said. “It’s another indicator that money is too cheap.”
    

            Cheap money has set off a V-shaped recovery in the broader stock market as well. Even after a sharp selloff Wednesday and another significant retreat Friday, the S&P 500 is not far off its record highs. That’s despite the fact that the United States remains mired in a once-in-a-century pandemic. 
    

            To be fair, investors are looking through the ongoing health crisis and focusing instead on the prospect that vaccines will allow a swift reopening of the economy. 
    

            Still, market valuations have rarely been as lofty as they are today. Shiller’s CAPE (cyclically adjusted price to earnings ratio) for the S&P 500 is at 35. The only other times it’s ever been above 30 were in 1929, just before the Great Depression, and during the late 1990s dotcom bubble, according to Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm.
    

            The frenzy has gone mainstream. Even sports franchises are tweeting about the market.
    

            “ZACH LAVINE TO THE MOON,” the NBA’s Chicago Bulls tweeted Thursday, with a stock chart-like graph showing the shooting guard’s rising point totals.

            “There are certainly some pockets of the market exhibiting bubble-like behavior driven by retail speculation, but who knows when they’ll pop,” Doug Clinton, managing partner at Loup Ventures, wrote in a report Thursday.
    

            That’s the thing about bubbles: they can continue – and get much bigger – until they don’t. 
    

            “No one can time these things,” Fisher said. 
    

            For his part, Shiller doesn’t think the overall stock market looks all that out of whack, mostly because interest rates are so low. That makes stocks a more attractive option compared to other assets.
    

            “It’s not a great time to buy stocks,” he said. “But it’s maybe OK to stay in.”

            “Saturday Night Live” returned for its first show of 2021, and had one question on its mind: “What still works?”
    

            That’s how the NBC variety show opened its program on Saturday night, with cast member Kate McKinnon hosting a show that asked what still works in America. The first category was “government.”
    

            McKinnon brought out “Marjorie Taylor Greene,” the congresswoman from Georgia who faces backlash over her controversial actions and recently resurfaced social media comments, to see if government still works.
    

            “Our first topic is government and already I have my doubts,” McKinnon said.
    

            Greene, who was played by Cecily Strong, came out and immediately offered McKinnon a gun.

            “So Congresswoman Greene… hard to say those words together,” McKinnon said. “What are some of the theories you believe in?”
    

            Strong’s Greene responded, “How much time you got?”
    

            After hearing some of Greene’s theories, McKinnon asked if she really believed those things and then asked if she’s really a US representative.
    

            “People can Google you and it’ll say she’s a real member of the US government?” McKinnon asked again.
    

            “That may not be the first thing that comes up, but yes,” Strong’s Greene responded.
    

            McKinnon thanked Greene for coming and said, “so government doesn’t work.” She then moved on to the stock market, which had a wild week thanks to Reddit, and brought on the majority shareholder of GameStop, “Derek Boner.”
    

            Boner, who was played by Pete Davidson, corrected McKinnon by saying, “first of all, it’s pronounced ‘stonk’ market.”
    

            McKinnon then asked Davidson’s Boner if the company’s crazy week reflects GameStop’s business.
    

            “Uh, we sell games?” Davidson’s Boner asked.

            McKinnon came to the conclusion that the stock market doesn’t work, either.
    

            After going through topics such as social media and the Covid-19 vaccine rollout (both of which aren’t working either, according to McKinnon), “SNL” finally found something that works in America: Tom Brady.
    

            The Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback, who’s heading back to the Super Bowl with his new team, appeared on the show played by this week’s host, John Krasinski.
    

            “You’re supposed to win football games and you just keep winning football games,” McKinnon said. “You might the only thing in America that still works… So I guess everyone must be rooting for you, right?”
    

            “Almost no one,” Krasinski’s Brady responded. 
    

            McKinnon said she’d be rooting for him because the country can still rely on him and “it’s not like you’re a weird Trump guy or anything, right?”
    

            Krasinski’s Brady immediately thanked McKinnon for having him and left the stage.
    

            McKinnon ended the segment by saying that she’s been slowly losing her mind, and then belted out the show’s signature catch phrase, “Live… From New York! It’s Saturday night!”

China's army of small investors want in on the GameStop mania,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/investing/china-gamestop-investors-intl-hnk/index.html,"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            The frenzy over GameStop has inspired amateurs everywhere to shake up stock markets. Now China’s massive army of retail investors wantsto get in on the action. 
    

            Talk of the video game retailer’s epic share surge has taken over Chinese social media and the eye-popping gains in that stock and others have become the envy of the country’s young day traders. They’re now calling on each other to band together to emulate their American counterparts in driving up the share prices of struggling companies. 
    

            “Market makers are trembling in front of retail investors who grouped together,” wrote one user on the social media website Weibo. “It will soon be China’s turn.”
    

            Just as Millennials and Gen Zers in the United States have bemoaned the hedge funds and short-sellers that are part of the Wall Street elite, many small investors in China have cried foul over what they see as exploitation of the market by the big institutions.

Reddit investors shake up Wall Street


            Mainland China’s financial markets are very different to New York’s. Short-selling is highly regulated and incredibly rare, making it hard forChinese investors toreplicate the US frenzy that has pumped up GameStop sharesas a way to stick it to hedge funds that bet the company’s stock would crash. 
    

            Even so, everyday investors in China have a ton of influence over market activity. There are more than 177 million retail investors, or individual traders, in China. That’s 99% of the investor base, according to December statistics compiledby the China Securities Depository and Clearing Corporation.And they have their grievances, too. 
    

            Mom-and-pop investors often complain that they are being harvested like “leeks” — a common vegetable in the Chinese diet” — by the big players cheating them out of money they think they deserve.  (The government can sometimes be the target of this anger, too, if the broader market is doing poorly.) 
    

            “This is so awesome,” wrote another Weibo user, referring to the GameStop saga. “The ‘leeks’ from all over the world should all unite.” 
    

            Chinese investors could in theory try to collectively push up the price of an individual stock and then dump it before institutional investors do. But that’s a tall order, given the resources and knowledge that big-time stock pickers have. And institutional firms that focus on long trades can ultimately benefit from stock surges. 
    

            Dictating major market swings is “theoretically” doable for Chinese individual investors, said Kenny Tang, CEO of Royston Securities, a Hong Kong-based brokerage firm, given their familiarity with using social media chat rooms to place bets on individual stocks. 
    

            “You can imagine it’s not hard for some of them to gang up and have an influence on individual stocks, especially small caps,” said Tang.
    

            China is no stranger to market volatility driven by frenzied trading. When the Nasdaq-style Star Market launched in Shanghai in 2019, local investors helped some of the stocks skyrocket in value. Shares in one company rocketed by 400% on the first day of trading. 
    

            The Chinese government and state media are also keenly aware of how those individual investors can drive shares. State media, for example, called on local investors to pour money into markets last summer as the economy recovered from the coronavirus pandemic. When the rally appeared to be moving too fast, some news outlets dialed back a bit and encouraged more conservative trading. 
    

            Analysts warn, though, that coordinated trading in a country like China, where everything is highly regulated, is fraught with peril.
    

            “If you catch regulators’ attention, it probably won’t end well for you,” said Tang, who added that people who attempt to organize big market swings risk arrest, should the government suspect them of stock market manipulation. 
    

            Others, like retail investor Luke Chen, aren’t really sold on the idea of an amateur revolution in China because of how much more professional knowledge the established investment firms hold. 
    

            “Individual investors are way less powerful than big investors in terms of capital size, investing knowledge — even some trading apps are exclusively better optimized for big investors,” said Chen, who is based in Shanghai.

Melvin Capital hedge fund lost 53% in the GameStop frenzy,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/melvin-capital-reddit-gamestop/index.html,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Melvin Capital, a premier Wall Street hedge fund entangled in the frenzy over GameStop
            
                (GME), lost 53% in January, a source familiar with the matter told CNN Business. 
    

            Melvin, a major short-seller of GameStop, bet that the company’s shares would drop. But, on January 11, GameStop announced new board members who could help it with digital sales. That set off a fury on Reddit, namely subreddit WallStreetBets, which catapulted GameStop’s stock more than 1,600%.
    

            Hedge funds like Melvin with huge short positions in GameStop and other stocks targeted by WallStreetBets got burned. The Reddit group specifically targeted stocks that were heavily shorted. At one point, GameStop had more short interest than shares on the market.
    

            The Wall Street Journal first reported Melvin’s losses.
    

            Melvin Capital was founded by Gabe Plotkin, and it started the year with roughly $12.5 billion in assets. It ended the month with more than $8 billion after receiving commitments from current investors for more capital in the final days of the month, the source said. 
    

            Last week, Citadel, a hedge fund owned by billionaire Ken Griffin, provided the firm with a more-than-$2-billion bailout.
    

            “The fund’s portfolio liquidity is strong,” the source said. “Use of leverage is at the lowest level since Melvin Capital’s inception in 2014.”
    

            Melvin found itself at the heart of the GameStop saga after Robinhood suspended trading of the stock and several others Thursday. The move was followed by an onslaught of backlash from individual investors, such as those from Reddit, who felt Robinhood was giving into pressures from Wall Street and the requests of hedge fund managers.
    

            The frustration from Robinhood users was soon followed by a class-action lawsuit against the stock-trading app for its decision of restricting trading of stocks like GameStop.

A college student made big bucks off GameStop stock. Now he's donating video games to a children's hospital,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/us/college-student-gamestop-stock-donates-to-hospital-trnd/index.html,"Tue, 02 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            After making thousands off GameStop stock last week, a 20-year-old college student used his newfound riches to pay it forward to a local children’s hospital. 
    

            Hunter Kahn, a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University, donated multiple Nintendo Switch consoles and games to Children’s Minnesota Hospital in Minneapolis after cashing out almost $30,000 in GameStop stock last Wednesday, he told CNN.
    
A post shared by Hunter Kahn (@hkahn3)

            GameStop shares have jumped 1,625% in the past month. The soaring percentages are mostly due to a group of investors on Reddit, who are buying the stock in a movement to hurt short sellers and hedge funds that bet on the stock to go down. 
    

            Kahn, who lives in Stillwater, Minnesota, said he participated in purchasing GameStop stock to join the movement to prove “the big boys on Wall Street” wrong. But, he said, donating a portion of his new fortune toward helping kids at the hospital felt better than waking up to any monetary gain. 
    

            “As a beneficiary of the recent events on Wall Street I think it is important that myself and others pay forward our good fortune,” Kahn wrote in an Instagram post. “These events have highlighted a lot of corruption and with this transfer of power it is important that we don’t become men in suits ourselves.”
    

            Kahn’s donations are valued at more than $2,000, Children’s Minnesota Hospital said. 
    

            “We’re so grateful for this generous donation that will help bring joy to kids at our hospitals, especially during these challenging times,” Jennifer Soderholm, president of Children’s Minnesota Foundation, said in an email statement to CNN. “It’s inspiring to see young people in our community choosing to give back and pay it forward.” 
    

            His donations include: six Nintendo Switch Lites, multiple games and e-shop gift cards, and screen protectors and cases.
    

            The hospital said patients are already using the donations.
    

            “There’s no group of people more deserving of receiving a bunch of video games than some kids going through a hard time,” Kahn told CNN. 
    

            After Kahn shared a photo of his donation on the Reddit page WallStreetBets, many in the online day trading community praised him. He garnered more than 179,000 upvotes on his post. One user lauded his actions, calling him “The real Robinhood.”
    

            Kahn said he encourages others who have profited from the movement to continue to use their good fortunes to pay it forward. 
    

            “If we’re criticizing these people on Wall Street and moving the money from one side to the other side, it would be meaningless if we behave exactly like these people that we were criticizing,” he said. 
    

            He is still holding on to the original 50 shares that he bought at $30, and said he plans to use the rest of his earnings toward paying off his college tuition.
    

  Correction: An earlier version of this story listed the wrong type of Nintendo consoles donated to the children's hospital. Hunter Kahn donated six Nintendo Switch Lites.

            The mania that drove the recent GameStop stock rally should remind all investors of the need to stay diversified. It’s simply not wise to put all your eggs in one basket, whether what’s in that basket is filled with ultra-safe municipal bonds or high volatility cryptocurrency.
    

            Shares of GameStop
            
                (GME) are still up nearly 150% this year. But at its current price of around $45, the stock is about 90% below the peak of $483 it hit late last month during the Reddit-fueled frenzy against short sellers who bet GameStop
            
                (GME) shares would drop. 
    

            Clearly, some investors got in way too late -— and were left holding the bag.
    

            That’s why experts say investors looking to build wealth for such longer-term goals as buying a house, paying for a child’s college tuition or retiring comfortably can’t afford to put a big chunk of their money into a single asset, especially not a risky meme stock or volatile cryptocurrency such as bitcoin
            
                (XBT).
    

            “If it seems too good to be true, then it probably is,” said Lance Ippolito, an ex-hedge fund trader and the lead strategist at Future of Wealth, a division of investing firm WealthPress.
    

            “There’s always a new fad on the block. But they often end badly,” he added. “People lose sight of this and get tunnel vision.”
    

            In a stock market that continues to rise, too many people are starting to think that investing is so easy and risk-free and that they can make enough money to retire by the age of, say, 30. That’s not a healthy attitude, or a realistic one.
    

            “The mindset with investing should be how much can I lose, not how much can I win. You’re not playing a slot machine,” Ippolito said. “You don’t go to Las Vegas with $10,000 thinking that you’re going to leave with $50,000.”
    

            That mentality can even affect how investors approach the supposedly safer big tech stocks that dominate the S&P 500. But investors shouldn’t feel safe putting all their money in the FAANGs, Microsoft
            
                (MSFT) and Tesla
            
                (TSLA), either. Even quality stocks take a hit from time to time.
    

            “The real fear is that the air may be coming out of this speculative bubble and will infect other stocks,” said David Kirsch, a financial historian and professor at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School for Business.

            Kirsch added that the huge rally in Tesla and the current market infatuation with so-called “blank check” special purpose acquisition company stocks, or SPACs, could eventually subside.
    

            This doesn’t mean investors should ignore risky stocks, cryptocurrencies or other volatile assets. After all, bitcoin prices are currently above $50,000 — up from just over $4,000 last March.  
    

            The key, experts say, is moderation. A balanced portfolio will protect investors from holding too many assets that are likely to lose money.
    

            “Do not follow the crowd. It’s all about diversification,” said Vilhelm German, chief technical officer with iSun, a blockchain firm that runs Bitnuk, a Swiss Bitcoin exchange. 
    

            German said that investors should have no more than 10% of their portfolio in one asset. And because bitcoin is so volatile, investors should limit their cryptocurrency exposure to just 2% of their portfolio.

            Going “all in” on cryptos or an individual stock is unlikely to make an investor the next Warren Buffett overnight.
    

            “There is a lack of education out there in the markets,” Ippolito said. “People are seeing photos of others on Instagram, TikTok and Twitter driving a Ferrari because they claimed they made a lot of money on bitcoin.” 
    

            He added, “that is not how most investors make money, but you can make money from the market in the long run.” 
    

            In other words, anyone who is looking to buy or sell a financial asset has to do their homework. 
    

            “It’s good to democratize the stock market, but look where it leads us,” Kirsch said. “There is a need for more market literacy.”

Robinhood CEO details 3:30 am call to put up $3 billion,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/investing/robinhood-gamestop-vlad-tenev/index.html,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Robinhood received a startling 3:30 am call from its clearinghouse during last week’s Reddit-inspired market chaos asking for the free-trading app to put up a staggering $3 billion, co-CEO Vlad Tenev said Monday. 
    

            “This was obviously nerve-wracking,” Tenev told Tesla
            
                (TSLA) boss Elon Musk during an interview on the platform Clubhouse.
    

            For context, Robinhood had raised only $2 billion in total venture capital funding up until that point. That’s why the trading app had to draw down its credit lines last week. 
    

            And that’s why Robinhood announced Monday it has raised an additional $2.4 billion from investors. That is in addition to a $1 billion capital raise announced last week. The fact that Robinhood has felt the need to raise massive sums in such a short time underscores the intense financial pressure facing the company.
    

            Whenever investors buy stocks, brokerages like Robinhood must make a deposit first at a clearinghouse. But Tenev said the $3 billion ask was “an order of magnitude” larger than what Robinhood is typically required by the National Securities Clearing Corporation to put up.

            The $3.4 billion capital raise came in the form of debt, specifically a convertible note, a person familiar with the matter told CNN Business. 
    

            The fact that Robinhood went this route instead of selling equity is another signal of the severe financial pressure facing the startup because of Reddit-inspired market turmoil. A convertible note, a common way early-stage companies raise money, is a type of bond that can be converted to common stock.
    

            Cash-strapped private companies sometimes choose this option because it delays the need to establish a new value for the company. Admitting that a startup’s valuation has gone down can cause negative publicity. And Robinhood’s valuation would have likely been pressured by the turmoil of the past week.
    

            Last week, Robinhood outraged users and lawmakers by prohibiting purchases of GameStop
            
                (GME), AMC
            
                (AMC) and other favorites of WallStreetBets, the Reddit group that disrupted parts of financial markets. Hours later, Robinhood raised $1 billion from existing investors in a move that signaled a cash crunch. 
    

            “We had no choice in this case. We had to conform to our regulatory requirements. The team did what they could to make sure we were available for customers,” said Tenev, who said he was asleep at the time of the early morning call from NSCC on Thursday.
    

            But the decision later on that day to restrict trading also damaged Robinhood’s brand — because the startup has long said its mission is to democratize investing. Some users threatened to quit the app, while Robinhood faced bipartisan calls for investigations in Congress. 
    

            After huddling with his senior executives, Tenev said they persuaded the clearinghouse to lower its request for capital from $3 billion to $1.4 billion.
    

            “We were making some progress, but it’s still a high number,” Tenev said.
    

            During the interview, Musk commented that it “seems weird” that Robinhood suddenly received such a large request from its clearinghouse.
    

            “I wouldn’t impute shadiness to it or anything like that,” Tenev said, adding that NSCC was “reasonable” and “worked with us” to lower the deposit request. “It was unprecedented activity.”

Inside the Reddit army that's crushing Wall Street


            Indeed, shares of GameStop, AMC and other stocks favored by short-sellers skyrocketed last week after being targeted by WallStreetBets. Some hedge funds that took bearish positions in those stocks endured staggering losses and needed to get bailed out. The market action may have been amplified by other hedge funds and financial players who rode the WallSteetBets wave.


            The Robinhood co-CEO also addressed why traders on the app could sell shares of GameStop, but not buy them.
    

            “People get really pissed off if they are holding stock and they can’t sell it,” Tenev explained.
    

            Of course, they also get angry if they want to buy a stock but can’t.
    

Robinhood announced Sunday that it will further lift restrictions on stock trades — but not entirely. For instance, Robinhood users are able to buy only one share of GameStop and 10 shares of AMC.  
    

            The $3.4 billion round of funding was led by Ribbit Capital and include existing investors such as Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia. 
    

            “This funding is a strong sign of confidence from investors and will help us build for the future and continue to serve people through the exponential growth we’ve seen this year,” Robinhood said in a blog post. 
    

            Tenev again denied speculation that its decision to cut off buys of GameStop was aimed at pleasing entities controlled by billionaire Ken Griffin. 
    

            “That’s just false,” he said.
    

            Earlier this week, Citadel, the massive hedge fund owned by Griffin, provided a $2 billion bailout to GameStop short-seller Melvin Capital Management. Melvin Capital had bet that GameStop shares would drop — and the hedge fund was crushed when the opposite happened.
    

            Citadel Securities, the market maker also owned by Griffin, is a major source of revenue for Robinhood. Like other brokerages, Robinhood gets paid to route orders to market makers, a controversial practice known as payment for order flow.
    

            Last week, representatives for Citadel Securities and the Citadel hedge fund denied any role in Robinhood’s decision to halt purchases of GameStop.
    

            Musk asked Tenev if Citadel would have had a say in who was put in charge of the clearinghouse that requested the $3 billion deposit. 
    

            “I don’t have any reason to believe that,” Tenev said. “You’re getting into the conspiracy theories a little bit.”

            No matter what happens next to shares of GameStop and AMC or the price of silver, average Joes and Janes are now an undeniable force to be reckoned with on Wall Street. 
    

            The short squeeze last week that propelled GameStop
            
                (GME) and other momentum investments popular with the Reddit crowd now appears to be on hold. GameStop
            
                (GME) plunged more than 50% Tuesday while AMC
            
                (AMC), silver prices and silver mining companies also fell sharply. 
    

            That’s partly due to trading restrictions from Robinhood and other brokers on how many shares of volatile stocks like GameStop, AMC
            
                (AMC), Express
            
                (EXPR) and Nokia
            
                (NOK) that retail investors can purchase in a single stock at a time.
    

            But heavily shorted stocks could wind up rallying again. In fact, on Tuesday Mark Cuban urged members of Reddit’s WallStreetBets community to stay the course with stocks like GameStop.
    

            “I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB,” the Dallas Mavericks owner and Shark Tank investor said on a Reddit AMA. “I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again.”

            After all, retail investors have proven that they can push hedge funds around – and they are likely to start focusing on other stocks and commodities that they think can (and should) move higher.
    

            “Social investing is not going away,” said Kerim Derhalli, CEO and founder of Invstr, a trading app. “This is a powerful commercial trend and we are just at the beginning of it. People have more information and power.”
    

            Derhalli pointed out that as younger investors increasingly start buying and selling stocks, the market will need to adapt. He said the rise of other popular stocks, such as Tesla
            
                (TSLA) and Beyond Mea
            
                (BYND)t are due partly to Millennials and Gen Zers investing in brands that they know and like. 
    

            “Younger retail investors are in touch with changes taking place. They understand consumer trends because they are the ones making and creating them,” Derhalli said. “There are some Millennials making a lot of money and there are hedge funds pissed off that retail investors have joined the game and are beating them at it.”
    

            Yet a number of Wall Street veterans are concerned that this won’t end well for smaller investors. 
    

            They point to the dot-com/tech stock collapse in 2000 as a sign of what can happen when retail investors get too excited and lose focus of fundamentals such as sales and earnings – not to mention valuations.

            Back then, the trading frenzy was built on message boards like Raging Bull and Yahoo Finance as opposed to Reddit and Twitter. 
    

            “This is troubling and disconcerting. It could be like March 2000 all over again,” said Richard Smith, CEO of The Foundation for the Study of Cycles, a research firm.
    

            “What this has done more than anything is expose how gamified the stock market environment is, and it will hopefully have people ask questions about whether or not this is how we want markets to work,” Smith added.
    

            If average investors wind up getting burned by stocks like GameStop, that could lead to less confidence in Wall Street and the wider market. 
    

            Some lesser experienced investors may just give up on owning stocks altogether –  as many individuals did after the 2000 crash and again when Lehman Brothers imploded in 2008. 
    

            “The market is going to be destabilized. Too many people will lose money. Fewer people will participate in the stock market – not more,” said Sergey Savastiouk, founder and CEO of Tickeron, an artificial intelligence platform for traders and investors.
    

            “What’s going on with GameStop and AMC is like driving without a license,” he added.
    

            But there are some major differences between now and two decades ago – not to mention the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009, a time when social media and free online trading weren’t as ubiquitous as they are now. 
    

            Average investors can now trade more efficiently and in a cost-effective manner thanks to no-fee brokerage firms such as Robinhood – a move that essentially forced all the other major brokerages to drop commissions. 
    

            The rise of fractional trading (i.e. owning a set dollar amount of a high-priced stock like Amazon or Alphabet) and the popularity of index ETFs also makes it easier for investors to buy small pieces of many stocks.
    

            And Reddit’s megaphone is significantly louder and more influential than the old chat boards of the late 1990s.
    

            “This trend will not end anytime soon. There are some investors who play in the individual stock arena just the one time. But there is a fear of missing out,” said Gust Kepler, founder and CEO of BlackBoxStocks, a trading software firm.
    

            “That may not sound much different from the late 1990s with day traders, but now social media augments the ability for groups of investors to band together and share information in real time,” Kepler added.

Barstool CEO on why Robinhood story goes 'beyond business'


            Along those lines, even Smith of the Foundation of Cycles expressed begrudging admiration for the Reddit traders who figured out how to stick it to the short sellers. 
    

            “I have respect for those who saw what was going on, how it worked and exploited it,” he said. “But what value has been created?”
    

            Stocks like GameStop and AMC aren’t increasing in value because they’re producing high revenue and profit, paying big dividends or adding significant juice to the economy by creating thousands of jobs.
    

            But that misses the point. There is no rule that says investors should only buy large blue chip companies. Some investors are growing tired of buying safer, passively run index funds and want to gamble.
    

            “Individual investors are often thought to be risk averse. But not all of them are,” said Josh White, a finance professor at Vanderbilt University and former SEC economist. “Some have a preference for what’s more like a lottery.” 
    

            “They may actually lose often but every now and then they will hit a home run like GameStop,” White said. “As long as there is that one big hit that takes place, people will keep gambling.”

            Hedge funds that bet against GameStop and other stocks have been crushed by the Reddit army – and they’re infecting the rest of Wall Street.
    

            The most heavily shorted stocks have nearly doubled in value over the last three months, according to Goldman Sachs. Those staggering gains created distress for short-sellers, setting off a negative spiral in the broader markets.
    

            “The past 25 years have witnessed a number of sharp short squeezes in the US equity market,” Goldman Sachs strategists wrote in a note published Monday, “but none as extreme as has occurred recently.”
    

            For context, the most heavily shorted stocks with market values above $1 billion rose by a more modest 77% during the second quarter of last year. The current short squeeze also exceeds the 56% rally for those stocks toward the end of the Great Recession and similar ones during the dotcom bubble.

Robinhood CEO details 3:30 am call to put up $3 billion


            A mob of traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets page have sent GameStop
            
                (GME), AMC
            
                (AMC) and other stocks skyrocketing in recent days. GameStop
            
                (GME) lost a quarter of its value Monday but it’s still up nearly 1,200% on the year. 
    

            WallStreetBets successfully triggered an epic short squeeze, where investors that bet against GameStop have been forced to unwind their bets and buy the stock back. That in turn has driven GameStop even higher, creating even more losses for short-sellers. 
    

            Melvin Capital, a hedge fund that bet heavily against GameStop, lost a stunning 53% of its value in January. The hedge fund eventually had to get bailed out by Citadel and Point72, two hedge funds that provided a $2.75 billion lifeline.


            The enormous losses for hedge funds and other short-sellers spilled over into the broader markets last week. The S&P 500 suffered its worst week since October – and some analysts at least partially blamed the Reddit-fueled mayhem. 
    

            Here’s why: Hedge funds that bet against GameStop and other Reddit-favored stocks were forced to take steps to counter their losses. Some faced margin calls, requests to put up more capital when positions weaken. To raise cash, they had to sell completely unrelated but highly liquid stocks such as Apple
            
                (AAPL) and Amazon
            
                (AMZN). And that in turn caused other investors to take chips off the table, continuing the negative feedback loop. 
    

            “This week demonstrated that unsustainable excess in one small part of the market has the potential to tip a row of dominoes and created broader market turmoil,” Goldman Sachs strategists wrote in the note.
    

            Not surprisingly, US stocks bounced back Monday as GameStop tumbled. The S&P 500 rallied 1.6%, its best one-day gain since November. The same pattern was playing out during premarket trading Tuesday.

It's not just GameStop. Market bubble fears are rising


            Goldman’s prime services arm, which caters to hedge funds, said that last week represented the largest active hedge fund de-grossing since February 2009 during the Great Recession. De-grossing means hedge funds unwound their positions – by closing out a bet against GameStop or by selling shares of a company like Alphabet, for example.
    

            Despite those moves, Goldman Sachs said that hedge fund net and gross exposures remain close to record highs, “indicating ongoing risk of positioning-driven selloffs.”
    

            Charlie McElligott, managing director at Nomura Securities, called last week a “crowding gross down shock” and warned that based on volatility metrics, more selling could be ahead.
    

            However, Goldman Sachs strategists remain bullish on the stock market, reiterating its prediction that the S&P 500 will end the year at 4,300. That would translate to an 14% gain from Monday’s close.
    

            The performance of the stock market after short squeezes tends to be dictated by the economy. When the pace of growth was improving, the S&P 500 tended to perform well during the month after short squeezes, according to Goldman Sachs.

            “If growth remains the key driver of stock prices, investors have reason for optimism,” Goldman Sachs strategists wrote.
    

            Others are concerned about how GameStop mania is another example of speculative excess in overly exuberant financial markets. From the red-hot IPO market to SPAC mania, evidence of bubble-like behavior is mounting.
    

            Citigroup’s Panic/Euphoria Model of market sentiment has been signaling caution since November. However, more recently this closely watched gauge has climbed above even the levels of early 2000 during the dotcom bubble, a “particularly troubling” development, Citigroup chief US equity strategist Tobias Levkovich warned clients in a note Monday.
    

            “We believe that too many investors are complacent and worry more about market rallies than pullbacks,” Levkovich wrote.

Robinhood is airing a Super Bowl ad amid its GameStop fiasco,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/03/media/robinhood-super-bowl-commercial/index.html,"Wed, 03 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Hot Stocks 




            Robinhood, the stock trading app that helped fuel GameStop mania and ended up in a PR crisis, is running a Super Bowl ad.
    

            The 30-second spot, which will make its TV debut during Sunday’s game, highlights the company’s branding push that it is “opening America’s financial system to everyone.” The commercial features everyday people living their lives and shows how they can incorporate the Robinhood app into their daily routines. The commercial ends with the slogan “we are all investors.” 
    

            The ad will run at a precarious time for Robinhood. 
    

            Last week, Robinhood outraged users and lawmakers by prohibiting purchases of GameStop
            
                (GME), AMC
            
                (AMC) and other favorites of the WallStreetBets Reddit group that disrupted parts of the financial markets. Hours later, Robinhood raised $1 billion from existing investors in a move that signaled a cash crunch. Days later, the free-trading app raised an additional $2.4 billion from investors — a massive sum underscoring the intense financial pressures suddenly facing the company. 
    

            Robinhood’s decision to curtail certain trades prompted users to file a class-action lawsuit claiming that the company’s actions unfairly rigged the market against its own customers. And Senator Elizabeth Warren this week demanded answers from the company for “abruptly changing the rules” on individual investors by temporarily banning purchases of certain stocks.
    

            The company’s blog post about the Super Bowl ad doesn’t mention the controversy. Rather, Robinhood said the ad was created in “hopes of reaching and empowering millions of people” that have “felt left behind by America’s financial system.” 
    

            “We’re in this for the early morning jogger, the midday study breaker, the late-night nursery rhymer—because we all invest in ourselves every day,” the company said in the post.
    

            The feel-good vibe of the ad, which is costing Robinhood roughly $5.5 million to air during the game, follows a similar playbook used by other companies looking to regain good will from the public and offer a mea culpa. Wells Fargo
            
                (WFC), Uber
            
                (UBER) and Facebook
            
                (FB) all went that route in 2018 following various controversies. 
    

            An effective apology ad addresses the “elephant in the room,” Tony Calcao, executive creative director at ad agency CP+B, said of those 2018 campaigns. 
    

            “If you want to get those customers back,” he said, “you had better acknowledge that you screwed up.” 
    

            Perhaps it doesn’t need to acknowledge anything. Data from SimilarWeb shows that the number of downloads totaled more than 1.8 million last week —  a 400% increase compared to the previous week.

            Robinhood is in hot water for banning investors from buying GameStop during part of last month’s Reddit-driven market mayhem. And now Fidelity is being accused of preventing one investor from selling some Reddit darlings, a move he says cost him $830,000.
    

            Louis Hernandez filed a claim with Wall Street’s self-regulator against Fidelity Brokerage Services on Thursday for blocking his attempts to unload shares of Nokia
            
                (NOK) and AMC
            
                (AMC) on January 28, his lawyer told CNN Business. Hernandez, who lives in Arizona, eventually sold the shares at a steep discount from where they had been trading when he initially tried to sell them, the lawyer said.

            “It caused a huge loss for our client in a matter of days. It was really devastating,” William Lewis, the lawyer representing Hernandez, said in an interview. 
    

            Fidelity said it had not received this specific complaint and does not comment on specific customers. The company said it does not have any restrictions in place, except for customers who trade with borrowed money, known as margin trading. Fidelity said it regularly adjusts margin and risk requirements for individual stocks based on market risks and other factors. 
    

            “Fidelity strongly encourages all investors to review their investments and ensure they align with their overall financial plan,” the company said in a statement.
    

            The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), Wall Street’s self-regulating agency to which Hernandez filed,does not publicly release claims and declined to comment. 
    

            The episode illustrates the chaos caused last month when an army of traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets community sent GameStop
            
                (GME), AMC and other stocks skyrocketing. Brokerages such as Robinhood were forced by clearinghouses to put up staggering sums of capital. Hedge funds like Melvin Capital that bet against GameStop
            
                (GME) had their short positions blown up. And some retail investors lost money when the Reddit-driven stocks imploded. 
    

            Hernandez bought $1.5 million of shares in AMC on January 27, his lawyer said. The movie theater chain’s stock skyrocketed 301% that day, driven up by traders on WallStreetBets.
    

            The next morning, Hernandez bought $1.5 million of shares in Nokia, another favorite of WallStreetBets. 
    

            Hours later, Robinhood outraged customers by temporarily suspending purchases of volatile stocks, including AMC and Nokia. Other brokerages imposed restrictions on the Reddit stocks as well.
    

            Seeking to get ahead of the impending selloff, Hernandez tried to unload his AMC and Nokia shares when they were trading at prices above what he paid for them, his lawyer said.
    

            “Over a period of hours he was trying to sell. The computer program won’t allow him. He called customer service and they told him he should be able to sell,” Lewis said.
    

            The timing was especially critical because Hernandez had used borrowed money through the brokerage, known as margin trading, to buy most of the shares. 
    

            Eventually, the share price of AMC and Nokia plunged so deeply that it triggered a margin call, in which brokerages demand that investors who bought stock with borrowed money deposit additional cash or securities. Hernandez attempted to deposit cash to cover the margin calls, but Fidelity refused to allow him to do so, his law firm said. 
    

            According to the claim, Hernandez was forced to liquidate his shares at a steep discount from where they were trading when he initially tried to sell – losing about $830,000 because of the delay, his law firm said.
    

            AMC closed down 57% on January 28, while Nokia lost 28%.

            “What’s really troubling for me is that when he wanted to sell, they couldn’t execute the orders,” Lewis said. “But as soon as there was a margin call, and they wanted him to sell, he was able to.”
    

            In addition to Fidelity, Hernandez’s claim also names National Financial Services, the company’s brokerage subsidiary. 
    

            Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is expected to testify at a hearing in Congress next week on the Reddit turbulence in financial markets, two people familiar with the matter told CNN Business. Tenev is likely to face questions over Robinhood’s trading restrictions. 
    

Tenev was asked during a recent interview on the platform Clubhouse why the app only restricted purchases and not sales of GameStop and other Reddit stocks.
    

            “People get really pissed off,” Tenev said, “if they are holding stock and they can’t sell it.”

Robinhood and Reddit in the spotlight during GameStop congressional hearing,https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/robinhood-gamestop-reddit-hearing-congress/index.html,"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            After more than five hours of testimony, the hearing has wrapped. 
    

            It seems to have been a tough day for Robinhood and Citadel Securities in particular, with lawmakers from both parties aggressively questioning both executives over whether their businesses do more harm than good. 
    

Reddit and Keith Gill, however, got the opposite treatment.
    

            At times, Gill was even directly praised by members of Congress for his success and his initiative. That may ultimately create a powerful narrative boost for him as he faces down a class-action lawsuit alleging that his YouTube videos constituted bad financial advice, a claim Gill refuted calmly and diplomatically by returning to his core talking point: He likes the stock.
    

Melvin Capital also received some scrutiny, but far less than Robinhood and Citadel. Between CEO Gabriel Plotkin’s bland office backdrop and his rather small size in the video frame, it sometimes appeared as if he were deliberately seeking to blend in with the environment in hopes of being forgotten. If so, it seemed to have worked.
    

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez clashed with Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev over whether Robinhood investors are truly trading for free on the platform, alleging that the company is simply “hiding the cost” from retail investors by subsidizing it with payment for order flow.
    

            “Would you be willing to commit to voluntarily pass on proceeds of payment for order flow to Robinhood customers?” Ocasio-Cortez asked.
    

            Tenev balked at the question several times before ultimately pointing out that payment for order flow “allows for commission-free trading.”
    

            The implication, Ocasio-Cortez said, was that trading on Robinhood isn’t truly free after all.
    

            Tenev conceded that Robinhood is a “for-profit business and needs to generate some revenue to pay for the costs of running this business.” But, he claimed, Robinhood’s model has become the standard industrywide.
    

            During his testimony, Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev admitted that the company made some mistakes during the meme stock trading frenzy. But he was somewhat evasive when Congresswoman Madeleine Dean asked him to elaborate.
    

            “You admitted to making mistakes,” Dean said. “Specifically, what mistakes did you make?”
    

        “I admit to always improving,” Tenev responded. “We’re not going to be perfect. And we want to improve and make sure we don’t make the same mistakes twice.”
    



            Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib and billionaire Ken Griffin got into a fiery exchange over whether or not to tax financial transactions.
    

            Tlaib noted that such a tax would raise nearly $800 billion over 10 years, an estimate that is backed up by a 2018 report by the nonpartisan CBO. The idea is that revenue could then be invested in infrastructure or other programs aimed at reducing inequality.
    

            Griffin, not surprisingly, is not a fan of a financial transaction tax. His high-speed trading firm, Citadel Securities, would be hurt by the levy.
    

“We firmly believe a financial transaction tax would injure Americans trying to save for retirement,” Griffin said. 
    

            Tlaib did not buy that explanation and criticized Wall Street broadly. 
    

“Let’s not gaslight the American people. Y’all will be fine with the tax,” she said. “Our folks are tired of bailing you all out when you screw up.”
    



            Under questioning from Rep. Ritchie Torres, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev disclosed two important stats that shed light on its underlying business model.
    

            Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev admitted that the app did not have the liquidity needed to meet an early-morning demand from its clearinghouse for $3 billion on January 28.
    

            “At that exact moment we would not have been able to post the $3 billion in collateral,” Tenev said. 
    

            Within a few hours, Robinhood managed to persuade the clearinghouse to lower its request to $1.4 billion, and the app imposed controversial restrictions on GameStop and 12 other stocks. 
    

            Congressman Anthony Gonzalez pointed out that if Robinhood did not impose those restrictions, the clearinghouse would have stepped in and liquidated unsettled trades. 
    

“It would not have been a good situation for the firm or the customers,” Tenev said, adding that it would have caused a “total lack of access to markets” for users. 
    

            Gonzalez said this would have been an “enormous catastrophe for Robinhood.”


            “I believe a vulnerability was clearly exposed in your business model and perhaps in the regime that governs your capital requirements,” he said. “We just can’t live in a world where my constituents could have had their shares liquidated without their consent.” 
    

            Illinois Rep. Sean Casten took Robinhood to task with a polite but devastating critique, highlighting the suicide of investor Alex Kearns.
    

        “There is an innate tension in your business model between democratizing finance, which is a noble calling, and being a conduit to feed fish to sharks,” he said.
    



            While the hearing is chugging along, the closing bell rung on Wall Street and it wasn’t a pretty day for GameStop (GME).
    

            The company’s shares tumbled 11.4% and closed at $40.69, near the lowest point of the session. It was a worse performance than the broader market, including the small-cap Russell 2000 index that GameStop is a member of, which also closed in the red.
    

            Melvin Capital learned a very painful lesson when the hedge fund was blindsided by an army of Reddit traders. GameStop shares went to the moon and Melvin Capital turned to rivals for a lifeline.
    

            “Us at Melvin, we’ll adapt. And I think the whole industry will have to adapt,” Melvin Capital CIO Gabe Plotkin said. 
    

            How? Well, for starters, Plotkin is going to pay more attention to the chatter on WallStreetBets. “There will be closer monitoring of message boards,” he said. 
    

            Indeed, Wall Street is keeping very close tabs on WallStreetBets. Thinknum Alternative Data recently built and launched a tool that provides hedge funds and investment banks a ranking of the most-mentioned stocks on WallStreetBets. 
    

            That kind of intel could have allowed Melvin Capital to unwind its bets against GameStop before that company’s shares skyrocketed. Melvin ultimately accepted a $2.75 billion cash infusion (don’t call it a bailout, according to Plotkin) led by rival hedge funds Citadel and Point72. 
    

            At one point, the short interest on GameStop was an unthinkable 140% – a scenario that Plotkin said is unlikely to be repeated.
    

            “I don’t think investors like myself want to be susceptible to these dynamics,” he said. 
    

Congressman Michael San Nicholas, the Democrat from Guam, began his questioning by congratulating retail investors who made money trading GameStop (GME) last month. 
    

            “You guys found a low float, low volume, massively shorted stock and you squeezed it,” San Nicholas said. “I think that investors like Mr. Plotkin, large money managers, probably doubled down on their short positions thinking that they were going to win, and in the end, the massive communication networks that we have these days rallied the small to beat the large.”
    

            San Nicholas called the success of small investors “something to behold” and said, “Robinhood made that possible.” 
    

            Reddit CEO Steve Huffman called out CNBC without saying those four letters.
    

            “People in the United States talk about stocks on Reddit, they talk about it on TV, in magazines – in fact they do all the time on TV encourage people to make what I would call bad investment decisions,” Huffman testified. 
    

            You can trust advice you get on Reddit, though, he argued.
    

        “On Reddit, investment advice is probably among the best because it has to be accepted by many thousands of people before getting that visibility,” Huffman said. “On Reddit you’re seeing retail investors who are giving authentic advice based on their knowledge, and you would not call into question positions they may hold before they talk about it on television.”
    



            Fun moment in the hearing: Congressman Juan Vargas wanted to know if Citadel ever told Robinhood to ban orders of GameStop during the trading frenzy. 
    

            “Are you asking if we have contact with Robinhood?” Griffin asked.
    

            “With respect to GameStop,” Vargas replied. “Did you talk to them about restricting? About buying – not selling – GameStop?”
    

            “Let me be perfectly clear: Absolutely not,” Griffin said.
    

            “So if we depose everyone in your organization we’ll find that?” Vargas asked.
    

            “That is correct,” Griffin said.
    

            GameStop’s short interest was greater than the number of shares on the market. That might not be such a good idea, Robinhood CEO said.
    

            “I do believe the ability for the same share to be shorted an indefinite number of times is somewhat of a pathology that should be fixed,” Tenev said.
    

            To make that fix, Tenev suggested modernizing the settlement infrastructure, which he called “antiquated.”
    

            “We don’t have the ability to properly track what shares have been shorted,” he added.
    

            To prevent Wall Street high-speed traders from gaining such an advantage over retail investors, progressive Democrats have proposed a financial transaction tax.
    

            Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev cautioned that it could hurt customers more than help — but he also acknowledged it could be beneficial overall.
    

        “It could eat into the transaction costs of our customers,” Tenev said. “That would be a cost to the retail investor. Of course that would have to be weighed against the potential benefits of this tax. It’s more complicated than it seems at first.”
    



            But Jennifer Schulp, director of financial regulation at the conservative Cato Institute, thinks it’s a bad idea.
    

            “No, I don’t think a financial transaction tax would have an affect on fraud or manipulation,” she said. “They often fail to raise money and distort trading.”
    

            Robinhood said its customers have made $35 billion with the company. CEO Vlad Tenev  said he has no idea whether his customers have made more or less money in aggregate than they would have if they invested in an S&P 500 ETF.
    

            Tenev said that number includes the value of all customers’ assets, including unrealized gains and positions in cryptocurrencies. But he wouldn’t share data on how much its  customers’ investments have grown compared to other investments. 
    

            “I don’t have that particular cut of the data top of mind,” he said. “Maybe I could get back to you on that.”
    

            When Congressman Jim Himes asked customers’ rate of return vs. investing in the S&P 500, Tenev objected to the question, saying rate of return should be compared to not investing at all – for example “money they otherwise would have spent or consumed.”
    

            Himes said it’s a lot of money, but it’s meaningless unless we know whether Robinhood traders have won or lost.
    

            “It is indeed a large amount of money, especially for our customers who are mostly individual investors,” Tenev acknowledged.
    

            Keith Gill, aka DeepF***ingValue, was early to GameStop mania, sharing his thoughts on the WallStreetBets subreddit that helped fuel the trading frenzy.
    

            But even he didn’t think it was going to hit a high of $483 a share.
    

            “At the time I thought it was possible but a very low probability,” Gill testified. “Early on I felt it was an attractive investment opportunity.”
    

            Gill acknowledged that he discussed short-sellers, who became the target of redditors’ significant vitriol. 
    

            “Yes, the topic did come up,” he said, in the understatement of the year.
    

            Reddit users’ stock trading activity on WallStreetBets likely would not meet the definition of market manipulation, according to Jennifer Schulp, a former enforcement official at the the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
    

            Speaking at Thursday’s hearing, Schulp said the Securities and Exchange Commission should probably investigate to determine if any actors sought to engage in stock manipulation on WallStreetBets. 
    

            But, echoing the remarks of Reddit’s own CEO, Schulp said there is little apparent evidence of misbehavior.
    

            “I do think the SEC should look,” she said, “but to this point I see very little that would meet a test for manipulation, which generally involves falsely deceptive behavior.”
    

Elon Musk isn’t involved directly in the GameStop hearing, but the Tesla CEO’s tweet — Gamestonk!! — in the midst of the January market frenzy caught the eye of Rep. Steve Stivers. 
    

            After the tweet, the red-hot GameStop stock soared even higher in after-hours trading, further squeezing hedge funds that shorted the stock.
    

            “Do you believe that tweet was targeting you because you had shorted Tesla stock in the past?” Stivers asked Melvin Capital’s founder, Gabe Plotkin, during the hearing.
    

            Plotkin demurred, saying he didn’t want to speculate about Musk’s motives or the potential impact it had on GameStop’s rise, which, incidentally, did cause Melvin to lose more than 50% in January.  
    

            Melvin’s short position on GameStop was so devastating the firm took a more-than-$2 billion capital infusion from fellow hedge funds. 
    

            Musk has a long history of taunting Tesla’s short-sellers, and regularly broadcasts his disdain for them on Twitter.   
    

            Robinhood’s CEO was asked about a 20-year-old options trader who killed himself after mistakenly believing he had a negative balance of $730,000.
    

            College student Alex Kearns mistakenly believed he owed that sum of money and took his own life last June after his desperate pleas to Robinhood went unanswered, according to his family.
    

            “First of all, I’m sorry to the family of Mr. Kearns for your loss,” Tenev testified. “The passing of Mr. Kearns was deeply troubling to me and the entire company.”
    

            Tenev testified that the company has taken a number of steps to prevent something similar from happening again, including:
    

            “It was a tragedy and we went into immediate action,” Tenev said.
    

            The Kearns family is suing Robinhood for the wrongful death of their son, who — like a growing number of novice traders — turned to the free trading app for access to sophisticated financial instruments such as options.
    

            Congressional hearings aren’t exactly known for fact-finding and informed inquiry, but we just got a bunch of really good questions directed at Robinhood executives.
    

From Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez:


            – “Robinhood seems to have perfected the gamification of trading providing the user with the perception that investing through the Robinhood app offers recreational gain … with no downside risk. … How does Robinhood balance disclosures about the potential downside risk of investing, including substantial downside loss?”
    

Vlad Tenev’s response: “We know that investing is serious and we’re investing in all the educational tools and support to help people on their investing journey.”
    

From Congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer:


            – “Do you think we need more legislation or did the system actually work? Was it self-correcting? The fact that someone like yourself was able to take advantage of shorting? Maybe there was over-aggressive investing that was taking place … they didn’t work because you outsmarted the system?”
    

Keith Gill’s response: “Increased transparency could help so someone like me could have a better understanding of how those things work could be quite beneficial to retail investors.”
    

            – “You mentioned settling trades in real time … What are the unintended consequences if you did something like that?”
    

Tenev’s response: “Certain market participants rely on next-day settlement to be able to take advantage of intraday netting and run up larger one-sided positions in certain stock with the knowledge they can close those positions by the time settlements happen, and I understand that could be a limitation to some of these institutions. … I don’t think these are insurmountable challenges.”
    

            Congressman Brad Sherman was trying to get Citadel owner Ken Griffin to admit that Robinhood traders get a raw deal compared to Wall Street fat cats. 
    

            Griffin wasn’t having it.
    

            Sherman was referencing Robinhood’s controversial payment for order flow, in which Robinhood is paid for its customers’ trades by market-makers like Citadel. FINRA fined Robinhood $1.25 million in December 2019 for sending customer trading orders to four broker-dealers without guaranteeing the best price.
    

            “Is the Robinhood customer getting the same price as the Fidelity customer?” Sherman asked Griffin.
    

            “Congressman, I believe that’s an excellent question,” Griffin responded. “The execution quality that we can provide as measured by terms of price improvement is heavily related or correlated to the size of the order we receive.”
    

            Sherman interrupted him, saying he was asking a clear question: If the orders are the same size, is it not true that one (Fidelity) is getting a better price?
    

            Griffin wouldn’t say: “Because the Robinhood community tends to be smaller in quantity…”  Griffin started before getting cut off again.
    

            “You’re evading questions by making up other questions,” Sherman shouted.
    

            “The quality of execution varies by the channel of order,” Griffin said. “Channels matter.”
    

            “Who gets the better deal – a broker who pays for order flow or one who doesn’t?” Sherman asked.
    

            “Size of the order is only one factor,” Griffin insisted.
    

        You are doing a great job of wasting my time. If you want to filibuster you should run for the Senate,” Sherman yelled. “When your broker is being paid for order flow you get a worse execution.”
    



            MyBookie.com, an offshore gaming site based in Antigua, was accepting bets on today’s Capitol Hill hearing such as whether hedge fund operator Steve Cohen or Telsa CEO Elon Musk will be mentioned, or how many times terms like “stonks” and “gamification” would be uttered.
    

            The betting started a day ago and closed at the noon ET start of the hearing with a modest amount of wagers in “the high four figures,” according to David Strauss, the site’s chief oddsmaker. Still, he added, “it’s more than I expected.” There was a $25 cap on the amount of any bet.
    

            Strauss said the site regularly takes bets on a wide range of news events, including the inauguration and the State of the Union address. “What’s popular betting on any televised event involving US politicians,” he said. Bets could include everything from what color tie the president would wear at the inaugural to the number of applause interruptions.
    

            The last congressional hearing it took bets on was the hearing with the CEOs of Facebook, Google and Twitter in late October.
    

            “That had much more wagered because the election was in full swing,” said Strauss. The 2020 presidential election itself was the most wagered event ever on MyBookie and other gambling sites.
    

            Vlad Tenev apologized for failing to communicate adequately to Robinhood users, in response to pressure from Rep. Carolyn Maloney.
    

            Maloney accused Robinhood of “vague language” and seeming to “reserve the right to make up the rules as you go along,” saying that the company’s statements to investors as it restricted trading were inconsistent with the explanation it later provided concerning Robinhood’s regulatory requirements.
    

            Tenev acknowledged that the company erred.
    

        I’m sorry for what happened,” he replied. “I apologize, and I’m not going to say that Robinhood did everything perfect, and that we haven’t made mistakes in the past.”
    



            Tenev pledged to learn from the experience so that the company won’t “make the same mistakes in the future.”
    

            Chairwoman Maxine Waters tried to set the tone of the hearing early by using an aggressive style of questioning, zeroing in on Robinhood and Melvin officials by demanding they answer questions in a yes-no format and cutting them off when they sought to provide longer answers.
    

            Waters’ tactics are an indication of how uncomfortable the hearing may soon become for some of the witnesses.
    

            Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev is being forced to explain his app’s decision to only ban purchases of GameStop, and not sell orders as well. 
    

            In short, Tenev said customers would have gotten very angry (even more upset than they were) if sell orders were banned.
    

“Preventing customers from selling is a very difficult and painful experience where customers are unable to access their money,” the Robinhood boss said. “We don’t want to impose that type of experience on our customers unless we have no other choice.”
    

            Tenev repeated that the decision to restrict purchases of GameStop, AMC and other stocks was “purely driven” by surging deposit and collateral requirements imposed by its clearinghouse, not at the behest of hedge funds. 


            He added that buy orders lead to greater capital requirements than sell orders. 
    

            Last week, a trader filed a complaint against Fidelity accusing the company of preventing him from unloading Reddit stocks before they imploded. The trader said this cost him $830,000.
    

            Reddit trader Keith Gill, also known as “Roaring Kitty” on YouTube, kicked off his testimony before the House Financial Services Committee with a few points of clarification. 
    

            “A few things I am not. I am not a cat. I’m not an institutional investor, nor am I a hedge fund. I do not have clients and I do not provide personalized investment advice for fees or commissions. I’m just an individual…”
    

            That kitty clarification, made against the backdrop of Gill’s “Hang in There” cat poster, was a nod to the widely shared (and yet still very funny!) moment in a Texas virtual courtroom when a lawyer unwittingly appeared on screen with a cat face filter.
    

            Gill, who goes by “Deepf—-ingvalue” on Reddit, described his role in the GameStop saga to the committee. He was one of the leading forces on the subreddit WallStreetBets driving GameStop’s stock up last month. He described himself as casual day trader with a genuine belief that GameStop was undervalued, rejecting any accusation he intentionally pushed investors to the stock to influence the market. 
    

Ken Griffin and Vlad Tenev will face questions over payment for order flow, which they will argue benefits retail investors by making it free to trade and giving them access to deep markets.
    

            Payment for order flow is the controversial practice of broker-dealers – including market makers like high-frequency trading firms – paying Robinhood and other free trading apps for executing the trades with them. 
    

            Critics say payment for order flow creates a conflict of interest that allows market makers to trade ahead of retail investors. And that this practice ultimately helped fuel GameStop (GME) mania because it paved the way to free trading and incentivizes brokerages to get people to trade frequently. (More trade orders on Robinhood means more payment for that order flow).
    

Robinhood was fined $1.25 million in 2019 by Wall Street’s self-regulator for “failures” related to routing orders without guaranteeing the best price.
    

        The GameStop frenzy “exposed how rigged the US equity markets are to enrich big Wall Street firms, high frequency trading firms and brokers at the expense of Main Street retail investors,” Better Markets CEO Dennis Kelleher wrote in a statement Tuesday.
    



Jennifer Schulp, director of financial regulation studies at the Cato Institute, lauded retail investing — equities trading by individuals using brokerages such as Robinhood — in her opening testimony during Thursday’s hearing. 
    

            “Investing in the stock market … provides a path to wealth for individual investors,” Schlup said. 
    

            She noted that stock ownership has traditionally been “skewed towards the already wealthy, and it is highly correlated with race, education and age.” But with the increase in popularity of retail stock trading during the pandemic, “investors who opened accounts for the first time in 2020 were younger, had lower incomes and were more racially diverse,” suggesting growing equality in investing, Schulp said. 
    

        These new opportunities for individuals to grow their wealth should be welcomed and expanded, not restricted,” Schulp said. 
    



            The volatility in GameStop (GME) shares are not necessarily an indication that guardrails need to be put up around retail investing, Schulp added.  
    

            “The fact that Gamestop traded temporarily, and perhaps still trades, above fair estimates of the company’s value is not, by itself, a reason for concern,” she said. “Stock prices move in and out of alignment all the time. And markets are no strangers to bubbles.”
    

            Melvin Capital lost 53% last month because of the hedge fund’s massive short position in GameStop. Its founder Gabriel Plotkin testified today that members of Reddit’s WallStreetBets group looking to hurt short-sellers like Melvin sent him and others anti-Semitic hate speech.
    

            Plotkin said one Redditor messaged him: “It’s clear we need a second Holocaust. The Jews can’t keep getting away with this.”
    

            But Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said the company’s moderators found no evidence of the messages Plotkin highlighted.
    

        “This team searched high and low for the specific comment mentioned in the previous testimony – or anything like it,” Huffman said. “The closest we could find was a single comment that received no votes and was deleted within five minutes. Such speech is not tolerated on Reddit.”
    



            Huffman acknowledged that speech on WallStreetBets is often “crass” but “within the bonds of our own policies.” However, the ADL highlighted several posts on the WallStreetBets subreddit that discussed anti-Semitic tropes, including: “Wall Street is run by the jews.”
    

            Shares of GameStop (GME) surged on Thursday as Keith Gill, the Redditor and investor who helped spark the trading fenzy on the stock, began his oral testimony.
    

            GameStop’s stock price rose more than 6% nearly as soon as Gill appeared on camera.
    

            While its bet only recently gained massive attention, hedge fund Melvin Capital has been shorting GameStop (GME) stock since the fund was founded nearly six years ago, chief investment officer Gabriel Plotkin told lawmakers. 
    

        Plotkin said Melvin decided to short GameStop “because we believed, and still believe, that its business model selling new and used video games in physical stores is being overtaken by digital downloads through the internet. That trend only accelerated in 2020 when, during the pandemic, people were downloading video games at home.”
    



            He also defended the overall practice of shorting stocks.
    

            “When our research suggests a company will not live up to expectations, and stock price is overvalued, we might short a stock,” Plotkin said. “We also short stocks because when the markets go down, we have a duty to protect our investors’ capital.” 
    

            The fund closed out its positions in GameStop several days before the surge in trading caused Robinhood and other brokerages to put restrictions on trading of the stock, he said. 
    

Kith Gill is expected to tell lawmakers Thursday that his interest in GameStop (GME) stock was borne simply out of a belief in the company’s potential. 
    

            Gill is somewhat different from the other witnesses testifying in the hearing — he’s an individual investor, and a Redditor and YouTuber (who is also known by online handles including “Roaring Kitty”) whose online investment advice videos helped spark interest in GameStop stock. 
    

            In written testimony provided ahead of the hearing, Gill said he believed GameStop “was dramatically undervalued by the market.”
    

        The prevailing analysis about GameStop’s impending doom was simply wrong,” he said.
    



            Gill says he first purchased GameStop stock, and later call options, in the summer of 2019, when GameStop was trading around $5 a share, and continued to increase his position throughout 2019 and 2020. Even after the recent volatility, Gill still believes “the market remains oblivious to GameStop’s unique opportunity.”
    

            He is prepared to tell lawmakers that his videos were meant to provide education for individual investors, not necessarily to encourage others to buy GameStop stock.  
    

            “The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,” Gill said in the written testimony.  “I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only … Whether other individual investors bought the stock was irrelevant to my thesis.”
    

            As for the massive volatility in GameStop stock several weeks ago, “others will have to explain it,” he said.
    

            During his testimony Thursday, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman will aim to help lawmakers understand the social media site’s content moderation policies and “governance structure,” as well as how the now-famous WallStreetBets community came about. 
    

            Reddit’s content policy prohibits “hate, harassment, bullying and illegal activity,” and is enforced by an “Anti-Evil” team that monitors the site, Huffman said in prepared testimony ahead of the hearing. 
    

            The site is also governed by a structure “akin to a federal democracy, where the aforementioned policies and teams represent the federal government, and the communities themselves represent states,” he said. For example, each community, or “Subreddit,” is created by users who become that community’s moderators. 
    

        Of WallStreetBets, Huffman said: “A few weeks ago, we saw the power of community in general and of this community in particular when the traders of WallStreetBets banded together at first to seize an investment opportunity not usually accessible to retail investors, but later more broadly to defend all retail investors against the criticism of the financial establishment.” 
    



            He added that Reddit evaluated whether “bots, foreign agents or bad actors played a significant role” in the volatile trading of meme stocks and found that “they have not.” 
    

            “It is important to protect online communities like WallStreetBets,” Huffman said. “WallStreetBets may look sophomoric or chaotic from the outside, but the fact that we are here today means they’ve managed to raise important issues about fairness and opportunity in our financial system. I’m proud they used Reddit to do so.”
    

Gabriel Plotkin, the co-founder and chief investment officer of Melvin Capital Management, told lawmakers Thursday that the hedge fund did not get “bailed out” amid its massive losses as GameStop (GME) shares surged. 
    

            Melvin Capital was among the hedge funds with huge short positions in GameStop, betting the share price would fall, ahead of the WallStreetBets-related surge. The fund lost 53% in January, a source familiar with the matter told CNN Business. In the wake of the volatility, Melvin Capital received a more-than-$2-billion capital infusion from Citadel, the hedge fund owned by billionaire Ken Griffin. 
    

            Here’s how Plotkin explained Citadel’s investing: 
    

        “Citadel proactively reached out to become a new investor, similar to the investments others make in our fund,” he said. “It was an opportunity for Citadel to ‘buy low’ and earn returns for its investors if and when our fund’s value went up. To be sure, Melvin was managing through a difficult time, but we always had margin excess and we were not seeking a cash infusion.”
    



            Plotkin also pushed back on the idea that Melvin Capital had any involvement in Robinhood and other brokerages’ decisions to restrict trading of GameStop and other volatile stocks. 
    

            “I want to make clear at the outset that Melvin Capital played absolutely no role in those trading platforms’ decisions,” Plotkin said. “In fact, Melvin closed out all of its positions in GameStop days before platforms put those limitations in place.”
    

Ken Griffin, the billionaire owner of hedge fund Citadel and high-speed trading firm Citadel Securities, is prepared to tell lawmakers Thursday that the trading firm helped meet retail investors’ needs during the surge in trading of GameStop (GME) and other “meme” stocks, but “had no role” in Robinhood’s decision to restrict trading of those stocks. 
    

        “I first learned of Robinhood’s trading restrictions only after they were publicly announced,” Griffin said in prepared testimony. “All of us at Citadel Securities are committed to the healthy functioning of the U.S. equities markets.”
    



            The relationship between Robinhood and Griffin’s financial empire is likely to face scrutiny during Thursday’s hearing. 
    

            According to Griffin’s testimony, Citadel Securities is the largest market maker in the US equities market. On January 27, as GameStop stock price peaked, the firm executed 7.4 billion shares on behalf of retail investors — more than the average daily volume of the entire US equities market in 2019, he wrote. 
    

            Like Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev, Griffin also plans to make a case for shortened equities settlement cycles. 
    

Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev is again pushing back on the idea that the app restricted buying of certain volatile stocks late last month at the direction of hedge funds or other market makers. 
    

            In written prepared testimony ahead of Thursday’s hearing, Tenev said: 
    

        I want to be clear at the outset: any allegation that Robinhood acted to help hedge funds or other special interests to the detriment of our customers is absolutely false and market-distorting rhetoric. Our customers are our top priority, particularly the millions of small investors who use our platform every day to invest for their future.”
    



            Robinhood has said the restrictions were necessary to help the company keep up with clearinghouse deposit requirements amid the volatility. 
    

            Among the things Tenev is expected to explain to lawmakers: the history of Robinhood, how it makes money, what financial literacy features the app provides to users and the events that led up to the company having to restrict trading of GameStop (GME), AMC (AMC) and other meme stocks. He is also set to make the case for real-time equities settlements, a change from the two-day system that currently exists. 
    

            “There is no reason why the greatest financial system the world has ever seen cannot settle trades in real time,” he said. “Doing so would greatly mitigate the risk that such processing poses. Indeed, real-time settlement would have allowed Robinhood Securities to better react to periods of increased volatility in the markets without restricting the purchasing of securities.” 
    

            Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev just revealed a new stat that underscores the free trading app’s enormous influence.
    

            “Today, the total value of our customers’ assets on Robinhood exceeds the net amount of money they have deposited with us by over $35 billion,” Tenev said. 
    

            A Robinhood spokesperson said that figure includes both real and unrealized gains since the company launched in 2013. 
    

            “While markets fluctuate, this tells me that our business model is working for everyday Americans,” Tenev said.
    

            Of course, some Robinhood users are angry over the app’s trading restrictions during the GameStop trading frenzy. And others worry Robinhood’s business model puts individual investors at a disadvantage to Wall Street firms.
    

            The House Financial Services Committee’s top Republican says Washington thinks you’re dumb. 
    

            Congressman Patrick McHenry in his opening statement said the people who were investing in GameStop during its Reddit-fueled frenzy knew what they were up to — they knew the risks and potential rewards. And Democrats calling for investor protections are trying to create inequity between the privileged people on Wall Street and day-traders they deem too stupid to trade on their own.
    

            “I believe Americans are far more sophisticated, informed and capable than people in DC give them credit for,” he said.
    

            He accused Democrats of trying to pass new regulations that protect retail investors who, “in their minds don’t know the difference between dogecoin and the Dow Jones without Congress telling them.”
    

            In reality, McHenry said he believes Americans know much more about how to invest than Democrats believe.
    

            How will lawmakers question Keith Gill? That’s what one Reddit user and GameStop investor most wants to know.
    

            Following Gill’s footsteps, AJ Vanover, a former battery store employee from Missouri, turned a $5,000 initial GameStop investment into more than $1.2 million. He’s still hanging onto the stock, he told CNN Business, and the value of his holdings now hovers at around $300,000 after he sold some to pay off debt and purchase a new computer.
    

            “It’s still considerable,” he said of his portfolio. “I’m going to get my wife a new car. We’ve had a lot of snow lately, so we want something with all-wheel drive.”
    

            Vanover thinks how lawmakers treat Gill will be extremely telling. He argues that Gill “clearly didn’t do any insider trading.”
    

        “He saw a valuable play before anybody else did,” Vanover said, “and took full advantage of it.”
    



            Watch his interview below.

            We’re streaming the hearing live, starting now. 
    

            Senator Elizabeth Warren is pushing for answers from Wall Street’s self-regulator over the Robinhood fiasco.


            Among other concerns, Warren calls out that, as CNN Business first reported, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev does not have a license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.   
    

            In a letter to FINRA, Warren asks the regulator to describe what determines whether individuals must be registered, what the registration requirements are for executives at broker-dealers and whether it’s “unusual” that the head of a broker-dealer is not registered.
    

            Some legal experts have expressed concern to CNN Business about Tenev’s lack of a license. 
    

            Robinhood pushed back: A footnote in Tenev’s testimony said FINRA requires that only those individuals engaged in the firm’s securities business need to be registered. And Tenev is the CEO of Robinhood Markets, the parent company that owns broker-dealer subsidiaries. 
    

            In bigger-picture issues within her letter, Warren raised questions about Robinhood’s business model — specifically the controversial practice known as “payment for order flow,” in which brokers route retail trades to high-speed trading firms. 
    

“I am concerned that current oversight of broker-dealers,” Warren wrote, “does not sufficiently prevent conflicts of interest caused by payment for order flow.”


            Republican Congressman Patrick McHenry wants everyone to slow down before rushing to push new regulation in the wake of the GameStop trading frenzy.
    

            “It’s premature,” McHenry, the ranking member on the House Financial Services Committee, told reporters during a call Thursday before the GameStop hearing. “A slow and methodical approach is right, especially when talking about our capital markets.”


            The Republican also pushed back against criticism of payment for order flow, the controversial practice where brokerages route retail orders to high-speed trading firms like Citadel Securities. 
    

            “As long as there is disclosure, it does not appear to me that there is investor harm,” McHenry said. “In fact, you’ve been able to crash fees to negligible or zero based off this practice.”


            Although no system is “perfect,” he said it appears the “good outweighs the bad” when it comes to payment for order flow. 
    

            Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the House panel, told CNN Business she plans to hold multiple hearings on GameStop.


            McHenry said he’s had no discussions with Waters about future hearings, although he left the door open to it.
    

            “I welcome the debate,” he said. 
    

            There may need to be “extra protections” and information disclosures for less-sophisticated investors who are day trading, particularly those investing in certain risky products, House Democrat Gregory Meeks told CNN’s Julia Chatterley ahead of today’s hearing before the House Financial Services Committee.
    

        “I’m looking to listen and hear and try to figure out whether or not the rules and regulations that we have in place have kept up with technology of today,” Meeks said. 
    



            A senior member of the House Committee on Financial Services, Meeks said he understands Robinhood’s aims to make trading more accessible, but he wants to know if the platform is steering people towards risky products and disclosing enough information to investors.
    

            Meeks wants to understand more about the role of short sellers, including hedge funds, in the recent market volatility and to probe the financial relationship between the Robinhood’ App and the market makers like Citadel. 
    

            “We don’t want to wait until something catastrophic happens at the end and say, oh, we should have looked at it earlier,” Meeks said.
    

            Here’s a very quick primer on the key players and issues in today’s hearing. 
    

            Today’s hearing is sure to be a spectacle. But as regulators debate their next steps, lawmakers have an opportunity to press key actors on issues of importance for anyone who buys or sells stocks on public markets.
    

            Representatives could go in a lot of directions. Here’s what remains top of mind:
    

            Lawmakers don’t expect to get to the bottom of all this in one day. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who chairs the committee, told CNN Business she will likely hold a total of three hearings on the matter.
    

Congresswoman Maxine Waters plans to thoroughly investigate the GameStop (GME) trading frenzy by holding multiple hearings on the matter.
    

            Waters, the chairwoman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, told CNN Business she will likely hold three hearings, with the first one occurring Thursday. 
    

            In a second hearing, Waters said she plans to bring in experts, including from Wall Street’s self-regulator, who can talk about the role of hedge funds and the democratization of trading.
    

            A third hearing would likely be focused on potential legislation, although Waters declined to pre-judge what new laws might be required.
    

            Waters said in an interview:
    

        The size of the occurrence is such that we need to put substantive time on it. to make sure we understand exactly what happened, how it happened and whether or not there are conflicts of interest, collusion or other things that need to be taken care of.”
    



            Lawmakers are expected to press for details about the relationship between Robinhood and billionaire Ken Griffin’s financial empire, particularly hedge fund Citadel and high-speed trading firm Citadel Securities.  
    

            At issue is whether either entity influenced Robinhood’s decision to halt trading. 
    

            Like other brokerages, Robinhood gets paid to route orders to market makers, a controversial practice known as payment for order flow. 
    

            Disclosure forms indicate that in December alone Robinhood generated about $12.4 million by routing orders to Citadel Securities, the high-speed trading firm owned by Ken Griffin.
    

            Another entity owned by Griffin, the hedge fund Citadel, provided a $2 billion bailout to GameStop (GME) shortseller Melvin Capital Management after its bets blew up. 
    

            Citadel Securities and Citadel the hedge fund have denied any role in Robinhood’s decision to suspend GameStop purchases. And Robinhood, under fire from angry users, has explained the trading restrictions were driven by staggering capital demands from its clearinghouse, not by hedge funds.
    

            Today’s hearing will feature testimony from five individuals with distinct backgrounds and interests. Here’s who to look out for:
    

Vladimir Tenev, Robinhood CEO 


Steve Huffman, Reddit CEO 
    

Ken Griffin, the billionaire CEO of Citadel (Griffin also owns the high-speed trading firm Citadel Securities)
    

Gabe Plotkin, Melvin CIO 
    

Keith Gill, a trader whose posts on the WallStreetBets subreddit helped fuel the GameStop (GME) boom
    

            The hearing is being driven by concerns in Washington about the fundamental fairness (or unfairness) of the modern market. 
    

            The GameStop (GME) trading frenzy shined a bright light on the free trading boom set off by Robinhood, the role of high-speed trading firms like Citadel Securities and the populist angst at the heart of the Reddit mob.
    

            “Markets advance faster than Congress,” said Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James. 
    

        This is Congress trying to hit the pause button to consider updates to regulation and legislation to match where the market has moved.”

            Hot Stocks 




            The WallStreetBets community is moving beyond GameStop and AMC. But its latest investment target isn’t a stock, bitcoin or even NFTs. 
    

            It’s gorillas. 
    

            That’s not monkey business. Members of the Reddit group — who gained national attention for their role in pumping up the January trading frenzy of GameStop
            
                (GME), AMC
            
                (AMC) and other meme stocks — rallied over the weekend to use their earnings to symbolically “adopt” gorillas through donations to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund.
    

            Why gorillas? It’s a bit of an inside joke: WallStreetBets members refer to themselves and others on the page as “apes,” as part of the group’s internal lingo.
    

            It all started Saturday, when a member of WallStreetBets adopted a baby gorilla named Urungano from the organization on behalf of GameStop. Since then, Dian Fossey has received thousands of new adoptions and more than $333,000 in donations, compared with around 20 adoptions in a typical weekend, according to a spokesperson. 
    

            “Used unrealized GME gains to adopt a gorilla,” one WallStreetBets poster said on the site.
    

            “Apes saving apes,” another said. 
    

            WallStreetBets investors sent GameStop’s stock soaring more than 1,500% at one point earlier this year, squeezing hedge funds that had shorted the stock and sparking a conversation about whether individual retail investors’ access to Wall Street is equal to that of large institutional investors. 
    

            One WallStreetBets poster said on Monday that the surge in donations to help save gorillas pointed to the benefits of making stock trading more accessible to individuals. Some members of the group have in recent days also discussed donating some of their “tendies” (or earnings) from trading GameStop stock to workers in the gaming retailer’s stores. 
    

            “Apes on Reddit will use (gains) to donate to good causes, pay medical bills, help the needy in their communities,” the user said. “I can’t wait for wealth to be given back to the little guy and have everyone benefit from it.”
    

            GameStop stock fell quickly following its peak around $350 during the January trading frenzy. But in recent weeks, the stock has begun climbing again and was trading around $200 on Monday, up more than 66% since the start of this month. Many WallStreetBets members say they’re still holding onto the stock, in hopes that the gains will continue.

            The Dian Fossey fund said in a tweet thread that gorillas are, in fact, “a great investment,” adding that funds will go toward tracking, monitoring and studying wild gorillas and their habitat. The fund says it is the “world’s largest and longest running” gorilla conservation organization.  
    

            “Gorillas live in the Congo Basin, the second largest rainforest in the world and a natural defense against #climatechange,” the group said. “When we save gorillas, we save the planet. How’s that for #ROI?”
    

            The organization’s CEO, Tara Stoinski, also posted a video to WallStreetBets, thanking the Redditors who were helping to fuel the donations. 
    

            “Hi WallStreetBets … I was just made aware that you have been adopting gorillas through our website,” Stoinski said in the video. “I just wanted to say thank you so much for this incredible support.”

            Hot Stocks 




            The names of the key players are different, but the lessons similar. The spectacular implosion of hedge fund Archegos Capital Management, much like the GameStop saga earlier this year, serves as a reminder of the dangers posed by extreme leverage, secret derivatives and rock-bottom interest rates.
    

            ViacomCBS
            
                (VIACA), Discovery
            
                (DISCA) and other media titans’ stocks crashed Friday as Wall Street banks that lent to Archegos forced the firm to unwind its bets. The epic firesale wiped out more than half of Viacom’s value last week alone.
    

            Major banks face billions of dollars in losses from their exposure to Archegos. Both Credit Suisse
            
                (CS) and Nomura tumbled Monday after warning of significant hits to their earnings.  
    

            The most startling part about the tale of Archegos is that it is a firm that few people had ever heard of before this weekend. And yet in this era of easy money, Archegos was able to borrow so much that its failure created shockwaves large enough to ripple across Wall Street — and impact everyday Americans’ retirement accounts.

            “It’s a wake-up call. With leverage, comes risk,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities Corporation. “This is the second time we’ve learned a lesson this year about leverage.”
    

            In January, another hedge fund, Melvin Capital Management, nearly collapsed after its massive bets against GameStop
            
                (GME) were blown up by an army of traders on Reddit. Investors were surprised to learn about the sheer size of the short positions anticipating the video game retailer’s stock price would fall.
    

            When GameStop shares instead went to the moon, Melvin Capital suffered staggering losses and was forced to reach a $2.8 billion bailout with larger rivals.


            “We saw it on the short side when GameStop blew up. Now we are seeing it on the long side,” Hogan said. 
    

            Archegos Capital was using borrowed money — apparently a ton of it — to make outsized bets that propped up media stocks. This type excessive leverage is made possible by extremely low interest rates from the Federal Reserve. 
    

            The full scale of these bets wasn’t clear until now. 
    

            Perhaps in an effort to avoid making public disclosure filings, Archegos reportedly used derivatives known as total return swaps to mask some of its large investment positions. Investors using these swaps receive the total return of a stock from a dealer and those returns are typically amplified by leverage. 
    

            Archegos could not be reached for comment on Monday.
    

            Typically, investors who own more than 5% of a stock are required to report that stake with the SEC. These filings do not appear to have been made this time.
    

            “Anytime a derivative is involved, you don’t really know how deep the tentacles go,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-head of trading at Themis Trading. 
    

            This complex strategy backfired last week. 
    

            Seeking to capitalize on its skyrocketing stock price, ViacomCBS announced plans for a $3 billion share sale. Up until that point, ViacomCBS shares had nearly tripled on the year. But the share sale appeared to be too much for the market to handle and the media boom morphed into a rout.

            Archegos faced margin calls from its Wall Street lenders. A margin call by a broker requires a client to add funds to its account if the value of an asset drops below a specified level. If the client can’t pay up — and in this case Archegos apparently couldn’t — the broker can step in and dump the shares on the client’s behalf. 
    

            Goldman Sachs, one of Archegos’ lenders, seized collateral and sold shares on Friday, a person familiar with the matter told CNN Business. This so-called forced liquidation set off a bloodbath Friday that drove down shares of ViacomCBS and Discovery more than 25% apiece. 
    

            Credit Suisse said that the default by a “significant US-based hedge fund” would cause a major hit to its earnings. A person familiar with the matter told CNN Business that Archegos was the firm causing the losses for Credit Suisse. 
    

            Nomura said its losses could be as much as $2 billion from “transactions with a US client.” 
    

            The episode demonstrates the intricate web linking firms across Wall Street — and the risks to the banks providing large amounts of leverage.
    

            “Systemic risk from secret and interconnected leverage, trading and derivatives in astronomical undisclosed amounts continue to permeate the shadow banking system,” Better Markets CEO Dennis Kelleher said in a statement.
    

            Hogan said investors must remember the inherent risks involved in the business lines of banks. 
    

            “They watch the creditworthiness of clients, but it’s not always perfect,” he said.

            The creditworthiness of Archegos is a central question here. Bill Hwang, the firm’s founder and a protégé of hedge fund pioneer Julian Robertson, was previously enmeshed in an insider trading scandal at Tiger Asia Management, a hedge fund he founded. 
    

            In 2012, the SEC alleged Tiger Asia made nearly $17 million in illegal profits in a scheme involving Chinese bank stocks. Hwang pleaded guilty that year on behalf of Tiger Asia to one count of wire fraud. Tiger Asia was sentenced to one year of probation and ordered to forfeit more than $16 million.
    

            In the wake of the insider trading scandal, Goldman Sachs
            
                (GS) stopped doing business with Hwang for a period of time, a person familiar with the matter told CNN Business. However, Goldman Sachs
            
                (GS) later resumed a relationship with Hwang, serving as one of his firm’s lenders.
    

            The blow-up of Archegos Capital brings back bad memories of Long-Term Capital Management. That massive hedge fund’s collapse in 1998 threatened the financial system, forcing the federal government to intervene.
    

            “This is likely not Long-Term Capital,” Hogan said, citing reforms that mean banks hold less risk than before the 2008 crisis. “I don’t think this is the tip of the iceberg.”
    

            Saluzzi, the Themis Trading executive, is not sure yet, pointing to how markets initially shrugged off the collapse of Bear Stearns hedge funds in the summer of 2007. 
    

            “We don’t know how far the tentacles go,” Saluzzi said. “Early in the Bear Stearns crisis, the market was fine — until it wasn’t.”

            The founder of the WallStreetBets is heading to Hollywood.
    

Jaime Rogozinski, the investor who started the subreddit that shook up Wall Street, has signed with United Talent Agency, the company confirmed to CNN Business on Wednesday. 
    

            The news was first reported by Bloomberg. 
    

            The agency reps some of biggest stars in Hollywood including Kevin Hart, Jessica Alba and Seth Rogen.
    

            WallStreetBets, which has more than 9.5 million followers on Reddit, sparked a trading frenzy earlier this year that sent share prices of stocks such as GameStop
            
                (GME) and AMC
            
                (AMC) to unprecedented highs — and devastating lows. 
    

            The boom or bust nature of the group’s investing tactics has perplexed many on Wall Street while spurring on a long-running battle between everyday investors and some of the market’s biggest short-sellers.
    

            Sounds like a great plot for a movie, doesn’t it? Well, that’s why the phenomenon has also sparked interest from several Hollywood studios.

                (NFLX)  and one from producers Jason Blum and Andrew Ross Sorkin for HBO, which is owned by CNN’s parent company, WarnerMedia.
    

            Rogozinski also reportedly sold the rights to his life story to RatPac Entertainment. The deal was in the “low six figures,” according to the Wall Street Journal.
    

            Rogozinski, who founded the Reddit group in 2012, told CNN in January that he never envisioned WallStreetBets becoming what it is today.
    

            “I predicted the trajectory where things were going, but by no means did I predict the timing or the magnitude,” Rogozinski told CNN’s Julia Chatterley. “I can’t imagine that I ever envisioned this happening.”

            Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown is strongly in favor of rolling back the Trump tax cuts for corporations — despite warnings from the business community that it could disrupt the economic recovery.
    

            “It was a giveaway to corporate interests and the richest people in the country,” Brown, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, told CNN Business on Thursday. “Of course we should scale some of that back.”
    

            The comments hint at the brewing fight between business leaders and Democrats over a fair corporate tax rate and how to pay for ambitious programs such as infrastructure spending. 


            Brown, speaking hours after President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan into law, voiced support for raising revenue by lifting the corporate tax rate, which Congress cut in 2017 from 35% to 21%.

            During the 2020 presidential campaign, Biden proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28% and administration officials have indicated they will look at increasing that rate as a way to help pay for a massive infrastructure package.
    

            “Taking away some of the tax breaks corporate interests got will only help the economy, it won’t hurt it,” Brown said. “It will increase the ‘whine quotient’ from corporate leaders, but they always whine and always want tax cuts. Their $3 million, $4 million and $10 million compensation is never enough.”
    

            The remarks underscore the sea change in leadership at the powerful Senate Banking Committee, which until January was led by pro-business Republican Mike Crapo. 
    

            Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, argued that the affluent reaped most of the benefits of the 2017 tax overhaul.
    

            “Look at the contrast between what we did this week. We cut taxes on the lowest income people,” he said. “It’s clear that corporations got an even bigger tax break from their billionaire president than they even asked for.”
    

            Business groups are vowing to fight any efforts to unwind the Trump tax cuts.

            The Business Roundtable, a powerful alliance of CEOs, warned this week that raising the corporate tax rate would make US businesses uncompetitive on the world stage just as the economic recovery gathers momentum. 
    

            “The Roundtable will be actively opposing efforts to raise corporate taxes,” Josh Bolten, the group’s CEO, said Wednesday during a press briefing. 
    

            Bolten argued that the Trump tax cuts set the stage for a strong stock market, historically low unemployment and strong business investment. 
    

            But for many Americans, the Trump tax law failed to deliver, with many companies sharing the windfall with shareholders via large stock buybacks instead of increasing wages or hiring more workers.
    

            Meanwhile, a debate has reignited over the wisdom of imposing a financial transaction tax that could help ease Washington’s monstrous budget deficits. 
    

            A 0.1% tax on stock, bond and derivative transactions could raise $777 billion for the federal government over a decade, according to a 2018 estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. (That estimate assumes trading volumes wouldn’t shrink after the tax was imposed.)
    

            This idea, long a goal of progressives, gained momentum earlier this year after the GameStop
            
                (GME) trading frenzy raised concerns about the health of financial markets. 
    

            Brown, whose committee held a hearing on the GameStop controversy earlier this week, expressed support for a financial transaction tax as a way to curb predatory trading practices. 
    

            “That’s one of the things we can do that makes the system fairer,” Brown told CNN Business.  
    

The White House previously said a financial transaction tax on trading deserves additional study — particularly in the wake of the GameStop frenzy — and could be part of a greater evaluation of how such a tax might boost both government revenue and market stability. 
    

            However, the financial industry argues that even a 0.1% tax on transactions will hurt retail investors and make it harder to buy and sell securities by sapping liquidity.

            “This approach has a long history of unintended consequences that will penalize workers, pensioners and American families,” a spokesperson for the Coalition to Prevent the Taxing of Retirement Savings told CNN Business last month. 
    

            That coalition includes the New York Stock Exchange and UBS
            
                (UBS), as well Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial
            
                (VIRT), two high-frequency trading firms that could be hit particularly hard by a financial transaction tax.
    

            Brown also expressed a desire to rein in high-speed trading.
    

            “High frequency trading is Wall Street recklessness at its worst,” he said. “It poses a real threat to workers and the economy. Adding [a transaction tax] ensures that Wall Street pays its fair share and probably behaves better.”

Stock rally continues as investors breathe a sigh of relief about inflation,https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/stock-market-news-031021/index.html,"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            Stocks closed higher on Wednesday, boosted by Congress passing President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package.
    

            Another Thursday, another batch of devastating jobless claims. 
    

            For nearly a year, the weekly first-time claims for unemployment benefits have been higher than they were even during the peak of the Great Recession. Tomorrow’s report will be no exception.
    

Economists expect another 725,000 initial claims, a slight improvement from 745,000 in the week prior. Continued claims, which count those submitted for at least two weeks in a row, are forecast at 4.2 million, down from 4.3 million.
    

            Neither of these numbers include benefit applications filed under the government’s pandemic programs, including the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program for those who can’t get regular jobless aid, such as the self-employed.
    

            With inflation concerns eased for now, investors are turning their focus to positive news for the economic recovery. 
    

            The Dow was up more than 520 points and on track for a record close after the House of Representatives approved the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan — paving the way for President Joe Biden to sign his top legislative priority into law later this week and deliver aid to most American households. 
    

            Key features of the plan include:
    

            The stock market is a mixed bag today.
    

            At the opening bell, the Nasdaq Composite rallied the most, but that moment has come and gone. The tech-heavy index is down 0.1% in the early afternoon.
    

            Meanwhile, the Dow has rallied some 450 points, or 1.4%, putting it on track to reach a new all-time high.
    

            The S&P 500 is up 0.6%.
    

            Going electric is all the rage in the car manufacturing world. Subaru is no exception. 
    

            “If the market clearly goes that way, we certainly do,” said Tom Doll, CEO and President of Subaru of America. “Clearly, the [Biden] Administration is signaling that they would like us to go more towards electric vehicles and infrastructure will help to do that.”
    

            “By 2030 at least 40% of our business is going to be electric or hybrid,” Doll said.
    

            The car maker is off to “a fantastic start” in 2021, Doll said on the CNN Business digital live show Markets Now, even after its production was briefly shut down during the height of the pandemic last year.
    

            “[The pandemic] didn’t affect our long-term planning but it affected our short-term production,” Doll said.
    

            Subaru expects to sell more than 16 million vehicles this year.
    

            Inflation is the bogeyman of Wall Street at the moment.
    

            Investors worry that a sudden jump in consumer prices is going to force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates out of nowhere. This would be bad news for stocks and good news for bond yields. But maybe this worry is a bit overdone…
    

            “People have to remember to apply some perspective when they look at interest rates,” said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets.
    

            With the Fed’s benchmark rates still near zero and the 10-year US Treasury bond yielding 1.52%, calling rates ‘high’ isn’t really accurate.
    

            “When interest rates rise from an exceedingly low level the economy is improving. And if the economy is improving, [company] earnings improve,” Belski said. So maybe higher inflation could actually be good for stocks.
    

            “I think people jump to conclusions when they hear a scary word,” Belski added. “We’re nowhere close to any kind of inflation pressures. The Fed will continue on what it’s doing well into 2023 until we see massive, massive gains in employment. And again we’re several quarters away from that.”  
    

            The Senate has passed President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package and the House is due to vote on it shortly.
    

            Greg Valliere, chief US policy strategist at AGF Investment calls the stimulus package “lavish,” but also thinks there will be attempts to have some of pandemic benefits last longer.
    

            “I feel confident in saying not since [President] Lyndon Johnson have we seen such a dramatic increase in spending,” Valliere said on the CNN Business digital live show Markets Now.
    

            “The problem is the Lyndon Johnson Great Society spending ended with stagflation,” which is defined as rising inflation but stagnating economic growth, he said.
    

            Even though Valliere believes that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will know the warnings signs, there is a real risk that inflation will spike, Valliere said.
    

            As for raising interest rates, Valliere said that “I have to take [Powell] at his word. I think the rest of this year the Fed will continue with asset purchases…I think it’s 2023 before they seriously begin considering hiking rates.”  
    

            Remember GameStop? From last month’s madness? If you thought we were done with that chapter of trading, you’re not alone.
    

            But little did we know.
    

            As the market is rallying, GameStop (GME) and other “meme stocks” haven’t been left behind. Shares soared enough — more than 41% — that the New York Stock Exchange had to briefly halt their trading. 
    

            GameStop’s peak today was $348.50, just above its record closing high from late January. And then it fell again, down nearly 20% midday. Phew.
    

            Why’s the market up today? This morning’s consumer price report soothed investors’ worries about a sudden inflation spike. Instead the market has time to focus on good news, like the stimulus package passed over the weekend.
    

            The Business Roundtable, an alliance of US CEOs, warned Wednesday it will fight the Democrats’ push to unwind the Trump tax cuts. 
    

            “The Roundtable will be actively opposing efforts to raise corporate taxes,” Josh Bolten, the group’s CEO, said in response to a question from CNN Business during a press briefing. 
    

            During the campaign, President Joe Biden proposed raising the corporate tax rate to 28%. That would be up from 21% currently but below the 35% it stood at prior to the GOP tax overhaul.


Biden officials have indicated they will look at the corporate tax rate as a way to raise revenue for an infrastructure package.  
    

            “After decades of decades of having an uncompetitive tax rate, we have finally arrived at a competitive US tax rate,” said Bolten, who served as a chief of staff to former President George W. Bush, as well as his director of the Office of Management & Budget.  
    

            Bolten pointed to the “good fruits” of the Trump tax cuts, including a strong stock market, historically low unemployment and strong investment.
    

            The Trump tax law failed to live up to the hype, however, with many businesses sharing the windfall with shareholders via large stock buybacks. 
    

            The debate over a fair corporate tax rate will heat up later this year, pitting Democrats against the business community.
    

            Today’s consumer prices report was in line with expectations and soothed worries among investors that inflation will spike and force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated.
    

            But economists still believe that the spring, and the full reopening of the economy, will bring an increase in prices.
    

        The most likely outcome is that after a spring peak, inflation will fall back while remaining above 2% for longer than at any other time over the past decade,” wrote Gregory Daco, chief US economist at Oxford Economics.
    



            There are three reasons for the expected price jump, according to Daco: First, comparisons to the prior year will make the relative increase bigger. Energy prices, which already accounted for the much of the price increase in February, will likely stay elevated. On top of that, spending and investing will pick up as the economy reopens. That’s a potent mix to boost prices.
    

            Another aspect is the way the inflation index is calculated, said Nancy Davis, founder of Quadratic Capital Management.
    

            Shelter, which is mainly accounted for through urban rents, is distorted because “people have scorned city life for suburbs,” according to Davis.
    

            “Right now, some housing markets are booming, but some aren’t and that is keeping the CPI down,” she said.
    

            Corporate America is growing more confident about the economic recovery as vaccinations continue to accelerate.
    

            The Business Roundtable said Wednesday that its CEO Economic Outlook Index jumped by 21 points during the first quarter to the highest level since early 2018 after the Trump tax cuts were enacted.
    

            Business leaders signaled plans to accelerate hiring and capital spending, and they expressed optimism about the outlook for revenue.
    

Nearly three-quarters (72%) of CEOs say conditions for their companies have already recovered or will have recovered by the end of 2021. That’s up from 67% of CEOs who said that at the end of last year.
    

            CEOs also upgraded their economic outlook, though not to the degree that Wall Street economists have. 
    

            The CEOs surveyed by the Business Roundtable project 3.7% GDP growth for 2021, up from 1.8% previously. However, Goldman Sachs is calling for 6.9% GDP growth, which would be the fastest pace since 1984.


            Business leaders are calling for Washington to take further steps to enhance the economic rebound: CEOs expressed support for recovery legislation that prioritizes investment in traditional infrastructure, broadband and steps to encourage business investment and R&D. 
    

            President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion rescue plan is getting high marks from business leaders.
    

Seventy-three percent of the CEOs and business leaders polled during Wednesday’s virtual Yale CEO Caucus support Biden’s American Rescue Plan. That includes 37% who indicated “strong” support for the package. 
    

            This suggests the C-Suite is even more supportive of the plan than Americans at large, as a CNN poll released Wednesday showed 61% of the public supports the legislation. 
    

            “This is a big day and we’re very thankful for what the administration is getting done and what Congress is getting done with this bill,” American Airlines CEO Doug Parker said during the Yale event.
    

            But business leaders are also concerned the Biden plan may be too expensive: Of the leaders polled by Yale, 61% say the $1.9 trillion package goes too far, while just 27% say it is just right.


            “But they still like it. There’s a paradox,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder of Yale’s Chief Executive Leadership Institute.
    

            Parker, the American Airlines CEO, said there will always be those who think something can be done for less. 
    

            “That’s not the bigger point,” he said. “The bigger point is there is broad public support for this bill. And that’s certainly true among those of us that are running airlines.” 
    

            Not even an hour into the trading day, two of the three major stock indexes are sharply higher.
    

            The Dow rose 1%, or some 320 points, building on the strong open.
    

            The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, pulled back a bit, but is still up 1%.
    

            The broadest market indicator, the S&P 500is the sole laggard so far, “only” up 0.7%.
    

            The House is about to vote on the final version of a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill that aims to juice the American economy. 
    

            Some critics have said the giant spending bill poses a dual threat to the US economy: overheating and inflation. White House Council of Economic Advisers member Jared Bernstein told CNN’s Poppy Harlow today that he shares those concerns — but the risk of not doing anything outweighed the risk of spending too much.
    

        “When you’re a White House economist, there’s absolutely nothing you’re not concerned at all about. I literally obsess on inflation statistics, including looking at the ones that came out this morning which show core prices, which is the most important gauge, year-over-year, 1.3%. That’s backward looking. You have to look at inflation expectations. They remain well anchored…. The Federal Reserve said people expect inflation to stay in the kind of range that it’s been. That’s very helpful for actually keeping it there. But let me tell you, it’s not that there is no risk of down-side problems. It’s that we’ve balanced the risk and the bigger risk is not doing enough.”
    



            White House senior adviser Cedric Richmond defended the size of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion rescue plan Wednesday as the appropriate response given the scale of the health crisis.
    

“It’s a humongous package. No one is pretending $1.9 trillion is not a lot,” Richmond said during the Yale CEO Caucus.
    

            But Richmond, the former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, pointed to the enormous challenge in vaccinating 300 million Americans. “It’s a logistical nightmare,” he said. 
    

        “We went big because we thought it was a big problem. And we’re going to go out now and educate people about the benefits of it so they can take part in it,” Richmond said. 
    



Of CEOs and other business leaders polled during the Yale event, 61% said they think the American Rescue Plan goes too far. 


            But Richmond compared the pandemic to the devastation in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. 
    

            “Sometimes in this country people get knocked down to a point where it’s beyond their capacity to get up,” he said. “If it’s beyond their capacity, no matter how hard they work or what they do, at some point the government has to be there to help you.”
    

            Stocks opened higher on Wednesday, continuing their rally from the day before.
    

            Inflation, the bogeyman of Wall Street, increased in line with economists expectations in February, keeping the good mood going for the market. The 10-year US Treasury bond yield was modestly weaker at 1.54% around the time of the opening bell.
    

            Consumer prices are getting higher — especially for gas.
    

            Overall, US consumer prices climbed by 0.4% on a seasonally adjusted basis in February, just as economists predicted, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said today. That’s slightly higher than January’s 0.3% rise.
    

Year-over-year, prices rose 1.7%, also in line with expectations and up from 1.4% in January. 
    

The main culprit: gas prices. The gasoline price index jumped 6.4% in February, accounting for more than half of the overall jump.
    

            Investors have grown nervous about a potential spike in inflation when the economy fully reopens this summer. The worry is that this dynamic could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, and that’s sparked a recent rally in government bond yields.
    

            The 10-year US Treasury yield inched up 0.01% to 1.56% following the release this morning.
    

            But stocks, which don’t like the idea of higher interest rates, aren’t fussing. Futures for all three major stock indexes were in the green ahead of the opening bell.
    

            Clorox (CLX) will partner with airline United (UAL), ridesharing leader Uber (UBER), rental car company Enterprise and movie theater chain AMC (AMC) as part of a new program to use only Clorox wipes and other of the company’s cleaning products, 13 of which are branded on its website with the tagline “kills Covid-19 Virus.”
    

            “We’re focusing on best practices as people go back out in the world,” said Tony Matt, the company’s chief growth officer, in an interview with CNN Business.
    

            Clorox has ramped up production of its wipes to avoid running out of products – a problem it faced last year due to unprecedented demand.
    

            Matt said Clorox has added significant capacity and now can ship 1.5 million packages of wipes per day, up from 1 million a year ago. The company is planning to increase production further to meet a goal of 2 million daily packages over the next few months.
    

            Investors worry that demand may have peaked, however. Shares of Clorox are down 7% this year and are nearly 25% below the all-time high they reached last year during the worst of the pandemic.
    

            The topsy-turvy stock market continues to search for direction. After a stunning tech stock boom Tuesday – the Nasdaq’s best day since November – stocks are more muted ahead of a potentially market-moving inflation report at 8:30 am ET. 
    

            Investors have been fearful that all that stimulus from Uncle Sam could boost prices, eating into corporate profits. With stocks already historically expensive, a little inflation could send Wall Street running for the exits.
    

            Here’s where things stand as of 6:15 am ET:
    

Disney+, the focal point of Disney’s media empire, has achieved a significant milestone.
    

            The streaming service has surpassed 100 million global subscribers in just 16 months, Disney CEO Bob Chapek announced at the company’s annual shareholders meeting.
    

        The enormous success of Disney+… has inspired us to be even more ambitious, and to significantly increase our investment in the development of high-quality content,” Chapek said in a statement.

            A generation ago – or even a decade or two ago – what happened on Sunday night was unthinkable: A royal taking on the monarchic “institution” and exposing its intolerant and unkind underbelly.
    

In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, Meghan Markle suggested that there were questions raised about the skin tone of Archie, the child she and her husband Prince Harry had. She admitted that she considered suicide amid her alleged mistreatment. And she laid it all at the feet of the massive operation of people who have grown up around the British monarchy to purportedly protect it at all costs.
    

            “I don’t know how [the Royal Family] could expect that after all of this time, we would still just be silent if there is an active role that the firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us,” Markle told Winfrey at one point. At another, she said this of her mental health struggles: “I went to the institution and said I needed to go somewhere to get help, said that I’ve never felt this way before … and I was told that I couldn’t, that it wouldn’t be good for the institution.”
    

            (Sidebar: The “firm” is reportedly the name the British royal family itself uses to refer to its mix of public relations pros, handlers, aides and the family itself. The “institution” is another moniker for this group.)

            The Duchess of Sussex’s decision to speak out against one of the best-known, most highly regarded and, well, efficient firms in the world is a striking reminder of our current global moment. Consider a similar series of rebellions against once-untouchable entities in recent years:
    

            * The #MeToo movement that has exposed the conduct of powerful men across the entertainment, media and political worlds
    

            * Brave victims have come forward to speak against the rampant sexual abuse in the Catholic church over decades
    

            * African American professional athletes have led a movement to expose ongoing inequities in policing in this country
    

            * Large pharmaceutical manufacturers have paid billions to settle claims that they pushed opioids to vulnerable populations knowing their addictive potential
    

            * The GameStop stock surge revealed the power of the small-time investor to disrupt the activities of massive financial institutions
    

            * Big tech companies – most notably Facebook – have come under increased scrutiny for their enabling of hate speech 
    

            There are more examples, but you get the idea. In virtually every part of our culture, we’ve seen individuals – or small groups of people – take on corporate, religious and athletic behemoths and win. Or at least force a public reckoning over long-accepted practices that, when seen under the light of public scrutiny, look really, really bad.
    

            These individuals charging at the proverbial windmill reflect a broader change in the way we perceive the institutions that were once the pillars of American society. In Gallup’s annual poll of the views held of 16 major institutions, a majority of Americans say they have a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of trust in just three: small business (75%), the military (72%) and the medical system (51%).
    

            The other end of the spectrum is far more crowded. As Gallup’s Megan Brenan writes:
    

            “Between roughly one-quarter and one-third of U.S. adults overall are confident in the criminal justice system, newspapers, organized labor and large technology companies, the last of which was measured for the first time this year. In addition to the aforementioned police, church, and public schools, banks, the presidency and the U.S. Supreme Court all receive middling confidence scores from the public.”
    

            (The least trusted institutions? Congress, with just 13% of people having a “great deal or “quite a lot” of confidence in it and cable news with 18%).
    

            In many cases, these institutions are at or near their low ebb in terms of public trust – damaged not just by scandal but also by a creeping public sense that these megaliths are actively bad for the culture – feathering their own nests at the active expense of the regular Joe. (Not for nothing: Donald Trump’s entire presidential campaign in 2016 was premised on the idea that the “elites” were purposely hurting the little guy to benefit themselves.)
    

            As I wrote about this phenomenon (which is even more pronounced among young people) all the way back in 2015:
    

“The erosion in confidence is impossible to blame on any one factor because it is so widespread. I believe that the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, made clear in a very powerful and frightening way that those tasked with protecting us might not always be able to do it. That led to a general sense of unease amid the populace that the bad behavior of Wall Street, the faltering economy, an ineffectual Congress and the string of high-profile killings of black men by police have all heightened.”


            The pace of those doubts – and the mistrust – has only accelerated in recent years, as large institution after large institution has been shown to have failed in major ways.
    

            The ability of a single person to directly question the motives and actions of an institution as long-lasting and staid as the British monarchy has far-reaching consequences.
    

            There is no question that it has meant that large companies and organizations have been forced into self-examination as to why they do what they do. And in some cases, it has forced change on them – change that would not have been thinkable even a decade ago. This is, obviously, a very good thing.
    

            What the collapse of trust in these once-unquestioned pillars of culture has also meant, however, is the increasing realization that we are operating without any real safety net. If we slip, there may be no one or nothing we can trust to catch us. What that leads to is an increased sense of unease and anxiety, the idea that we are simply on our own – adrift in a world in which there are no more trusted referees.
    

            This is the reality we collectively face at the end of the second decade of the 21st Century. Yes, we are more empowered and more able than ever before to question authority – and be listened to. But the institutional failures that have been exposed have left us more isolated, more fragmented and less happy.

A financial transaction tax may be aimed at hurting Wall Street. But it will hit Main Street investors instead,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/perspectives/financial-transaction-tax-investors/index.html,"Thu, 04 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

Editor’s Note: Fred Tomczyk is the former president and CEO of TD Ameritrade. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.


            In the wake of the GameStop stock trading frenzy, the Biden administration recently said it’s worth evaluating the impact of a tax on financial transactions, which would include the purchases and sales of stocks, bonds and derivative contracts, such as options and futures. Some claim such a tax could stabilize markets and raise revenue. They say it’s a simple and easy way to raise billions of dollars at the expense of Wall Street and the wealthy. However, history suggests that a financial transaction tax will not raise anywhere near the amount of funds its proponents suggest. And what money it does raise will largely come from Main Street investors, even as it also raises the cost of capital for American corporations.
    

            The US capital markets are the largest, most liquid and most efficient capital markets in the world. According to a study by Aaron Klein of the Brookings Institution, these markets finance more than 60% of the US economy. The US capital markets became this way through a combination of smart regulation, robust competition and advances in the use of technology. Imposing a financial transaction tax into this intricate ecosystem is like throwing sand into the gears of a finely tuned machine. The result will reduce market liquidity, given the higher cost to conduct transactions. And less liquidity, in turn, traditionally widens bid/ask spreads, which would increase the cost of capital for American businesses and slow US economic growth. 
    

            To be sure, proponents of a financial transaction tax come from a reasonable place. They want to raise revenue for critical investments like infrastructure, and at the same time, protect retail investors from volatile markets. But in a host of countries, like Sweden, Italy and Japan that initiated such taxes, investors shifted capital to new investment products that were not covered by the policy or moved their transactions out of country altogether.

            Also, it won’t just be Wall Street that bears the burden of this tax.  In my experience, taxes on Wall Street rarely, if ever, remain a tax on Wall Street. Just like a gas tax is passed from oil companies on to people at the pump, taxes on financial transactions will be passed from financial services firms on to individual investors – in this case as a higher cost to retail investors when the firms execute a trade or increase fees on mutual funds, ETF’s, 401k plans or pension plans. More than 65 million US households own stocks, according to the Investment Company Institute, including more than 100 million participants in 401(k) plans which primarily use mutual funds and ETFs to help save for retirement. And according to the Urban Institute, more than 20 million state and local government employees participate in a public pension plan. All of these hard-working Americans will wind up bearing the cost of any financial transaction tax as a tax on their savings and retirement nest eggs.
    

            As the former president and CEO of TD Ameritrade I can assure you that today’s retail investor has never had it better with lower costs, expanded investment choices and more powerful technology. Today a retail investor can buy a stock with a low or even no trading commission and have that trade executed in milliseconds. Yet, Sen. Bernie Sanders, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has proposed a financial transaction tax proposal of .5% on all trades. 
    

            Most countries that have implemented a financial transaction tax have found out the hard way that the tax did not raise anywhere near the amount its proponents claimed it would given the ease with which investors are able to move to different products or offshore trading venues. Sweden imposed a 1% financial transaction tax in 1984. Within six years of its implementation, 50% of Swedish stock trading volume had moved to other countries and the market dropped 5.3%. That’s what smart people do in efficient markets. Sweden abolished the tax in 1991, and share prices rebounded by 9.7%. 
    

            A financial transaction tax may be a great soundbite for politicians – hitting Wall Street to help pay for current economic deficits. But it will increase the cost of capital for American companies and it will wind up as a tax on Main Street investors – hard-working Americans who are saving for their retirement. It may be good politics, but it is not good policy.

            The recent pullback in tech stocks followed a spectacular surge at the start of the year. That should have longtime market observers worried about the similarities between now and the height of the dot-com bubble in 2000. 
    

            For all those Millennial Robinhood traders who were just kids 20 years ago and are relative newbies to the market, the recent volatility should serve as a lesson. For all the times that people say that “this time is different” that’s usually a telltale sign that it actually isn’t.
    

            The rise of meme stocks like GameStop
            
                (GME), the flurry of initial public offerings and special purpose acquisition company mergers as well as the stunning runs in Tesla
            
                (TSLA) and bitcoin
            
                (XBT) are nothing more than another case of the forces of market speculation running amok. 
    

            Investors are buying companies with significant challenges and ignoring the weak fundamentals. GameStop isn’t the only “meme” stock out there. Movie theater chain AMC
            
                (AMC), clothing retailer Express
            
                (EXPR) and headphone maker Koss
            
                (KOSS) have been soaring.

            And all the talk about “stonks” and cryptocurrencies on Reddit and in TikTok videos isn’t really that much different than people chattering about how high they thought Qualcomm
            
                (QCOM) and Cisco
            
                (CSCO) were going to go in the late 1990s on Raging Bull and Yahoo Finance message boards.
    

            There are numerous other echoes to the tech craziness of the late 1990s. 
    

            Blank check SPAC mergers may not have been popular more than twenty years ago. But there was another hot financial trend at that time that was also a sign of market froth – companies spinning off their online divisions or setting up so-called tracking stocks for them.
    

            Barnes and Noble, for example, trying to fight off competition from a still relatively new Amazon
            
                (AMZN), spun off its Barnesandnoble.com unit into a separately traded company in 1999. It was eventually folded back into the parent company.
    

            Tracking stocks were even more ridiculous than dot-com spinoffs. 
    

            With a tracking stock, a company would sell shares of a business unit that merely tracked the performance of the division. But investors who owned the stock didn’t have the right to vote on company matters like investors in other public companies did.

            Disney
            
                (DIS) used to have a tracking stock named Go.com for its online operations. NBC had an internet tracking stock as well. NBCi launched in 1999 – back when GE
            
                (GE) owned NBC. Comcast
            
                (CMCSA) is now the parent of NBC. 
    

            CNN owner AT&T
            
                (T) had a tracking stock for its new (at the time) wireless unit in the early 2000s. So did Sprint (now owned by T-Mobile
            
                (TMUS)) for its PCS wireless division. 
    

            None of these tracking stocks exist anymore.
    

            There were also plenty of unprofitable companies rushing to go public, despite having little in the way of revenue let alone profits. 
    

            The spectacular collapse of Pets.com stock after its IPO in February 2000 – just before the Nasdaq peaked – is still the poster child of wretched market excess. 
    

            The good news for investors today is that many of the big unicorns going public via IPOs, SPACs or directly listing their shares on exchanges are not Pets.com 2.0. Airbnb, Palantir, DoorDash and many other recent stock debuts are industry leaders. 
    

            Still, the valuations for many of these stocks are certifiably insane considering that many of the companies are still not profitable – even though their revenues are substantial and growing rapidly.
    

            The prices for top tech stocks, even the FAANGs, Microsoft
            
                (MSFT) and Tesla that currently dominate the S&P 500, might be unjustifiably high as well.

            According to data from FactSet, the S&P 500 is currently trading at more than 21 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months. That’s above the five-year average of just under 18 and the 10-year average of nearly 16. 
    

            It’s also approaching the peak March 2000 levels of 24 times earnings estimates. In other words, the market is priced for perfection. 
    

            That’s problematic. If (or when) the most bubbilicious stocks finally start to pull back, the sell-off can last a long time and the damage could be severe. 
    

            After all, when the Nasdaq first topped the 5,000 level in March 2000, it did so after surging past the 3,000 and 4,000 levels just a few months earlier. It was a mania. But once the dot-com bubble burst, the Nasdaq did not climb back above 5,000 again until March…2015. 
    

            So last year’s brief bear market pullback following the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak in March could be just a small taste of what’s to come for tech and momentum stocks.

Robinhood is getting rid of one of its most controversial features,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/31/business/robinhood-confetti-app-changes/index.html,"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

Robinhood is getting rid of the confetti animation that appears on users’ screens after they conduct their first trade and achieve other milestones. The change comes as the app faces growing scrutiny over what critics say is a gamification of trading that masks the potential for real losses in the financial markets.
    

            The design changes, announced in a blog post Wednesday, will roll out next week as part of “new, dynamic visual experiences that cheer on customers through the milestones in their financial journeys,” the company said.
    

            Robinhood currently displays confetti after a number of “firsts” for each trader, including when they initially deposit money into the app, make their first trade and upgrade to a premium membership. The confetti imagery will be replaced by new graphic elements featuring shapes and colors that are comparatively more sedate.
    

            The company recently filed to go public following a controversial start to 2021. 
    

            Robinhood set off a firestorm in January when it temporarily banned users from buying shares of GameStop
            
                (GME) and other stocks driven up by an army of traders on Reddit. Robinhood blamed the controversial restrictions on a demand from its clearinghouse to put up as much as $3 billion due to the market volatility.
    

            The company was sued earlier this year by the family of a 20-year-old trader who died by suicide after he saw a negative balance of $730,000 in his trading account and mistakenly believed that was the sum of money he owed. The tragedy drew attention to the gamified nature of the Robinhood platform, as well as the startup’s customer service policies, which it has since changed.
    

            And last December, Massachusetts securities regulators slammed the app for the colorful confetti and other marketing techniques. The complaint accused the company of violating state law and regulations by failing to take steps to protect its customers. It also said that Robinhood relentlessly bombards users with gamification strategies, including “colorful confetti raining down” on their screens after executing trades.
    

            However, controversies haven’t dented Robinhood’s popularity. Recent data from SimilarWeb shows that the app “receives more traffic than any of the traditional retail brokerages.” For example, January visits surpassed 50 million — about 10 million more than Charles Schwab’s website.

            On the audio-based app Clubhouse, people are gathering in virtual rooms to make whale moaning noises or to participate in silent meditation together. Hundreds of people on the popular gaming platform Discord started a server where they just send each other the letter “h” all day every day. And a new Twitter account created this week shows the same short clip of Tony Soprano crying in his car with different sad songs playing in the background and has quickly racked up thousands of followers. 
    

            After several years of concerning headlines about misinformation, election meddling, filter bubbles, online harassment and more, there are flickers of a more carefree – and weird – internet. At times it felt like a throwback to a more innocent web, when Dancing Baby filled our inboxes, Second Life took on a life of its own and Rickrolling was an ever-lingering threat. And all it took was a devastating pandemic that forced many in the United States and around the world to live their lives almost exclusively online for much of the past year.
    

            Make no mistake, those long-simmering problems remain. A year into the pandemic, we’ve seen both the dark and light sides of people spending more time online: Women, people of color and the LGBTQ community continue to face disproportionate harassment online. Boredom, anxiety and fear during the pandemic have driven people into dangerous conspiracy theories like QAnon or baseless anti-vaxxer beliefs. 
    

            But that same reliance on constant screen time has also given way to fun, creative and quirky behaviors online, which are testaments both to our need to feel connected with others and our urgent desire for escapism in a turbulent time.

            “It’s a sign of optimism and of the amazing flexibility and resiliency of human beings in terms of keeping ourselves healthy and connected to other people,” said Shira Gabriel, a psychology professor at the University of Buffalo. “This last year has been super depressing and difficult, but it’s also been really inspiring to me seeing what a great job human beings have done to find ways to make the best of this tough situation.”
    

            There is no shortage of colorful examples or online communities. Discord, which has become a popular place to hang out virtually during the pandemic, especially for Gen Z, has a server called “ChilledCow,” where members study, talk or make art while ambient music plays in the background. (It’s racked up more than 470,000 members since its creation last May, and also has a popular YouTube channel.) Another server named “Waffle House” has amassed more than 1,500 members and serves as a way to meet new friends in a virtual cafe setting. 
    

            People are now collecting wacky NFT artwork for millions of dollars and even bidding for tweets: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey put up his first ever tweet from 2006 on the NFT trading platform Valuables, where the current highest bid is $2.5 million. The mania around the Reddit page WallStreet Bets and the GameStop frenzy – which has its fans and critics – is also a product of people seeking out online communities. Even Dogecoin, a meme-influenced cryptocurrency dating back to the years before the dark sides of social media and the internet writ large became so evident, is once again back in the news and gaining traction. 
    

            Indeed, meme culture is going strong. On Monday, social media lit up over whether California or New York has the best bagels, spurring much debate and funny memes. On Inauguration Day, a photo of Senator Bernie Sanders wearing a mask and big mittens broke the internet and spurred endless memes for weeks, giving many a much-needed laugh and reprieve two weeks after the deadly riot at the US Capitol.

The hot new thing in tech: speaking into your phone


            Isra Ali, a clinical assistant professor of media, culture and communication at New York University, said Americans have been bombarded with “intense information” over the past year and have lived through major events from Covid-19 to Black Lives Matter protests and the US presidential election. “All of these events have forced us to really scrutinize and think about who we are all the time, and who we are in relationship to one another,” Ali said. 
    

            That may leave people craving moments of “mindlessness,” such as joining a virtual space where they can connect around something simple or silly, like making a noise together. “Just sitting together in an online environment and being together without having to think … is a relief,” Ali said. 
    

            The desire to lean into something lighthearted has also propelled TikTok into the mainstream during the pandemic.

            It’s game over for GameStop CEO George Sherman. The video game retailer and meme stock announced Monday that Sherman will be stepping down on July 31 — or earlier if a successor is found. 
    

            The news is not a major surprise given that Ryan Cohen, the co-founder and former CEO of online pet supplies retailer Chewy
            
                (CHWY), has been cementing his control over GameStop. 
    

            Cohen, whose RC Ventures firm owns a nearly 13% stake in the company, will become GameStop
            
                (GME) chairman following its next shareholder meeting in early June. 
    

            Shares of GameStop rose 6.3% Monday. 
    

            Sherman, a veteran retail executive who has only been CEO of GameStop since April 2019, inherited a tough job when he took over two years ago. 
    

            “I am very proud of what we have accomplished at GameStop over the past two years, including during the difficult Covid-19 pandemic,” Sherman said in a statement. “We have helped bring stability and strength to the business.” 
    

            Sherman was charged with turning around GameStop at a time when many gaming console sales were declining and people were increasingly downloading new games instead of buying them from stores. Shortly after Sherman joined the company, he announced plans to close up to 200 stores.
    

            “GameStop appreciates the valuable leadership that George has provided throughout his tenure. He took many decisive steps to stabilize the business during challenging times. The Company is much stronger today than when he joined,” Cohen said in a statement.
    

            But Sherman never really got much of a chance to execute his turnaround plan. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 upended the economic landscape for the entire retail industry. GameStop was forced to temporarily close stores.

            Enter Cohen. He took a stake in late 2020, news that excited a revolution of traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets board who believed that Cohen could get GameStop back on track. 
    

            GameStop became the quintessential meme stock in January, as social media fans battled hedge funds who were betting the stock would go down. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill even held hearings about the stock’s surge and how it was handled by online trading giant Robinhood.
    

            GameStop’s stock is up more than 700% this year – although shares are trading nearly 70% below the Reddit-infused all-time high from late January.
    

            Cohen has been asserting more control over GameStop since he invested in the company. In the past year, GameStop has hired several executives from Chewy and Amazon to help lead the company’s transformation into more of an online retailer.
    

            Te transition is showing some early signs of success. 
    

            Although overall sales in GameStop’s most recent quarter were down 3% from a year ago and below Wall Street expectations, online sales more than doubled. E-commerce now accounts for more than a third of total revenue, up from just 12% in the fourth quarter of 2019.

            George Sherman may still be the CEO of meme stock poster child GameStop. But it looks like Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen is really running the show. 
    

            GameStop 
            
                (GME)said Thursday that it planned to nominate Cohen, whose investment firm RC Ventures owns a nearly 13% stake in the company, to be its next chairman following GameStop’s annual meeting on June 9. 
    

            The company also said Thursday that following the annual meeting, all board directors will be compensated entirely in stock – which presumably will motivate them to take action to boost the price further. Board members will also have their compensation reduced by nearly 30% from a year earlier.

            Shares of GameStop were down 5% in late afternoon trading following the news. 
    

            The stock has been incredibly volatile this year thanks to a push from fans on social media site Reddit, who have been betting on a turnaround and battling short sellers that are betting the stock will go down. 
    

            GameStop shares are up 800% in 2021 – but are currently trading 65% below their peak price from late January. 
    

            Bulls hope that Cohen, who helped build online pet supplies store Chewy
            
                (CHWY) into a digital commerce juggernaut, will be able to work his e-commerce magic with GameStop too.
    

            GameStop named Cohen as the head of a strategic planning and capital allocation committee in early March. As part of that role, Cohen was expected to strengthen GameStop’s online commerce operations.
    

            The company has already taken several steps to do that, hiring several executives from Chewy and Amazon
            
                (AMZN) to help lead the company’s transformation.

            GameStop, like many retailers, has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Sales in its most recent quarter were down 3% from a year ago and below Wall Street expectations. 
    

            But GameStop had been struggling even before coronavirus, in large part because of a shift to more online and mobile games that could be downloaded directly to phones, consoles, PCs and tablets.
    

            Enter Cohen, who first took a stake in GameStop in September 2020. His influence on the retailer is bearing fruit. Although overall sales were down during the holiday 2020 period, online sales more than doubled. E-commerce now accounts for more than a third of total revenue, up from just 12% in the fourth quarter of 2019.

This $800 million whistleblower program is losing its top cop,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/16/investing/wall-street-whistleblower-sec/index.html,"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Hot Stocks 




            The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s highly-successful whistleblower program is stepping down at a delicate moment for the market watchdog.
    

Jane Norberg is leaving the SEC on Friday, after presiding over a four-and-half-year period during which the whistleblower office handed out a staggering $702 million in awards to 114 individuals who aided the agency’s investigations.   
    

            Her departure comes as former Obama-era official Gary Gensler takes over the SEC and as regulators come under fire from progressives – and even some famous investors – for failing to do enough to protect investors.
    

        Some people are uncomfortable and fearful. That’s why we take protecting confidentiality incredibly seriously.”
    

        Jane Norberg, chief of the SEC's whistleblower office
    

            “The program is in a really fantastic place,” Norberg told CNN Business. “If the staff keeps doing what they’re doing, it’s going to continue to be incredibly successful.”
    

            Norberg, a former Secret Service agent, admitted that she had some doubts about just how successful the whistleblower office would be when she joined the SEC in 2012. 
    

            “With anything new, you just don’t know at the beginning,” said Norberg, who previously served as the office’s deputy chief.


            Flash forward nine years and it’s clear the whistleblower program is instrumental in helping Wall Street’s top cop crack down on financial crime, everything from Ponzi schemes and insider trading to bribery and market manipulation.
    

            The SEC says it has fielded more than 40,000 tips from over 130 countries since the whistleblower program’s inception in 2012. Those tips have led to $3.9 billion in financial remedies, including more than $1.1 billion of ill-gotten gains that were returned or scheduled to be returned to investors, according to the SEC.
    

            “We knew the tips were coming in. The question is whether the information would be actionable and lead to solid enforcement actions,”Norberg said. “The answer to that is clearly yes.”

A government agency just paid a record $114 million to an anonymous whistleblower


            During the first seven months of this fiscal year alone, the SEC awarded more than a quarter of a billion dollars to whistleblowers, surpassing last year’s record sum. That means the agency has awarded a total of about $812 million since its 2012 launch. The awards are funded through sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators. 
    

            “It just felt like the right time for me. I’m looking forward to a new challenge and I know the office is in great hands,” said Norberg, who declined to share her career plans after leaving the agency. 
    

            Last fall, the SEC awarded a stunning $114 million to a single whistleblower who tipped the government off to misconduct and provided “extraordinary” assistance in an investigation. The agency has never identified what case was connected to the award. Norberg told CNN Business at the time that she hoped the record-breaking award would encourage more tips – and serve as a warning to Corporate America.
    

            The SEC protects the identifies of whistleblowers to shield them from reprisals – and it is likewise charged with punishing companies that retaliate against employees that serve as whistleblowers.

            “The monetary awards get all the press, but the anti-retaliation protection and confidentiality are just as important,” Norberg said. “If you take away any one of those, the program may not be as successful.” 
    

            Awards range between 10% and 30% of the fines imposed in SEC actions that result from whistleblower tips. The money can help motivate people to come forward, although sometimes they reach out for other reasons, including revenge. 
    

            “They may be taking a serious professional risk by coming forward,” Norberg said of whistleblowers who work at companies and decide to tip off the SEC. “Some people are uncomfortable and fearful. That’s why we take protecting confidentiality incredibly seriously.”
    

            Despite the success of the whistleblower program, the SEC’s critics worry the agency isn’t doing enough to catch financial criminals.
    

            Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a strong backer of new SEC chief Gensler, called out regulators last month over how a little-known hedge fund was able to borrow so much money that its implosion caused chaos on Wall Street. 
    

            “Regulators need to rely on more than luck to fend off risks to the financial system,” Warren said in a statement to CNN Business at the time. 
    

            Even some big shots on Wall Street are worried that regulators are asleep at the wheel.

Hedge fund meltdown: Elizabeth Warren suggests regulators should've seen it coming


            David Einhorn, the famed hedge fund investor, took regulators to task in a shareholder letter this week over the GameStop controversy and Elon Musk’s 2018 run-in with the SEC.
    

            “For the most part, there is no cop on the beat. It’s as if there are no financial fraud prosecutors; companies and managements that are emboldened enough to engage in malfeasance have little to fear,” Einhorn wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN Business. “For the most part, quasi-anarchy appears to rule in markets.”
    

            The SEC declined to comment on the Einhorn letter, but it’s clear the whistleblower program will be central to any efforts to step up enforcement.
    

            One way to make the program even more effective would be to speed up the process of paying out awards, which can be painfully slow.  
    

            Stephen M. Kohn, a whistleblower attorney and partner at Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto, said he has had clients that have waited more than six years after coming forward for their money.

            “It can be like pulling teeth. The delays are highly destructive,” said Kohn, who did not blame Norberg or the office itself for the delays.
    

            Instead, he pointed to a lengthy process that allows the SEC to drag out determining the validity of whistleblower claims long after the agency has punished the wrongdoers. 
    

            Still, Kohn applauded Norberg for making the SEC’s whistleblower office a “model” for the rest of the nation. 
    

            “She has totally got it, and put together a remarkable program,” said Kohn, who has worked with Norberg. “There is a real understanding of the stress these whistleblowers are under.”

            Hot Stocks 




            Bitcoin and its many peers have surged to new levels of popularity over the past year,but they’re still a mystery to many investors. 
    

            With new “coins” cropping up all the time, it’s hard to keep track of what’s worth paying attention to and what might not be here to stay.
    

            Meanwhile, major companies are jumping on the bandwagon: Tesla announced earlier this year that customers may buy vehicles with bitcoin. Digital payment platform Square
            
                (SQ) and PayPal
            
                (PYPL), which also owns transfer app Venmo, now also allow customers to use cryptos.
    

            Ranked by their market capitalization in US dollars, the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world are bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance Coin, XRP and Tether, according to CoinMarketCap.


            Their market caps range from more than $1 trillion to around $50 billion. But that doesn’t tell us anything about how they work and how valuable the single coins might be in a broader context.
    

            Here’s your guide to the biggest digital currencies today.
    

            Bitcoin is the biggest and most recognized fish in the crypto sea, with a market cap of more than $1 trillion.
    

            Created anonymously in 2009, the digital currency runs on blockchain technology, another buzzword from the past decade. Essentially, the blockchain is a decentralized ledger system where records of transactions are stored. That’s a key difference between bitcoin and traditional fiat currencies like the US dollar or the euro, which are controlled by central banks. 
    

            Bitcoin reached a record high of $63,000 per unit this month, which makes it by far the most valuable cryptocurrency.
    

            Many bitcoin bulls call it a store of value — a label that has historically been reserved for safe haven investments like gold — and argue that that the digital currency is a good investment to hedge against inflation. 
    

            It’s also prone to wild swings in value, so it may not the best option for risk-averse investors. Just a few days after hitting its record high this month, it suffered a flash crash, dropping some 14% in under an hour. 
    

            Part of bitcoin’s value is determined by the finite number — 21 million — of coins that can be created. Not all of the coins are in circulation, and bitcoin “miners” use computers to solve complex puzzles to create a new “block” on the chain. That process is in turn rewarded with bitcoin, though the reward halves for every 210,000 blocks mined. These “halving” events have in the past led to volatility in the bitcoin price.
    

            The mining process eats up a lot of computing power and electricity, which has led to concerns about bitcoin’s environmental impact.
    

            Ethereum is an open-source blockchain-based software, which has its own cryptocurrency called Ether. It is the second-largest digital currency by market cap at nearly $300 billion.
    

            The software was created with the idea to expand the use of the blockchain beyond bitcoin and use it in wider applications, which makes it more than “just” a cryptocurrency.
    

            Ether supply isn’t capped and new tokens are created constantly through a similar mining process as with bitcoin. It climbed to an all-time high of more then $2,500, according to CoinDesk data. 
    

            Ethereum was launched in 2015.
    

            The third-largest crypto with a market cap of nearly $90 billion, Binance Coin is a bit of a different beast. 
    

            The Binance Exchange is the largest cryptocurrency platform by volume traded, and created Binance Coin, or BNB tokens as a means to pay for fees on its platform.
    

            It has a top cap of 200 million tokens, but tokens are regularly destroyed — or “burned” — to reduce the total supply and stabilize the their value over time.
    

            Another way Binance Coin is different is that it can only be exchanged into other cryptocurrencies.
    

            Most recently, Binance hired Brian Brooks, the acting head of Office of the Comptroller of the Currency during the latter years of the Trump administration, to head its US business.
    

            XRP is the digital currency on payment platform Ripple. The neat thing about Ripple is that any currency — digital or otherwise — can be exchanged for another. That means users can pay someone in bitcoin without owning bitcoin, simply by using XRP as the bridge between the currency they own and the one their recipient wants to be paid in. This makes it a very fast means of payment.
    

            Banks have caught on as well: Bank of America
            
                (BAC), Banco Santander
            
                (BCDRF) and PNC Financial Services
            
                (PNC) are partnering with Ripple.
    

            XRP also doesn’t run on the blockchain but on a data structure called HashTree, which makes it different from other digital currencies. It can’t be mined, and its total number of coins is set at 100 billion.
    

            Despite the finite supply, the unit cost per XRP token is still pretty low, with its all-time high at $3.40, according to CoinDesk data. Its market cap is just above $60 billion.
    

            In December 2020, the US Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against Ripple, its CEO, and its chairman, over the alleged illegal selling of unregistered securities worth $1.3 billion. Ripple CEO Bradley Garlinghouse rejected the premise of the suit and in December called it “an assault on crypto at large.”
    

            The suit is a reminder that there is still a lot of regulatory uncertainty when it comes to cryptos, which could spell volatility in the years ahead as governments and institutions figure out what to do.
    

            Tether rounds off the top five of biggest digital currencies, with a market cap nearly $50 billion.
    

            It’s an example of a so-called “stablecoin” because it is pegged to the US dollar. This keeps Tether relatively stable compared with other cryptocurrencies, which can be very volatile. When it was first created in 2014, the value of each token was set at $1. 
    

            Tether’s all-time high was $1.32, according to data from CoinDesk.
    

Dogecoin started in 2013 as a joke based on a viral dog meme. Its market cap briefly grew to more than $40 billion and it’s competing with Tether for spot number five on the list of biggest cryptos. Such are the times.
    

            The digital currency’s popularity and value soared over the past year as bitcoin’s value climbed and Tesla CEO Elon Musk repeatedly tweeted about it. This year alone, its value skyrocketed more than 7,800%, according to data from CoinDesk. It even briefly overtook XRP as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap in April.
    

            It’s also popular with Reddit users, who have taken on a notorious role among retail investors following the rise and fall of the shares of gaming retailer GameStop
            
                (GME).
    

            Dogecoin hit an all time high in mid-April at $0.43. That’s right, the currency is still super cheap.
    

            There are 129 billion coins in circulation now and new ones will be available to mine every year. That’s what keeps the value of each coin relatively low — especially compared with bitcoin, which is a scarce resource in comparison.

            The total value of the dogecoins in circulation is nearly $50 billion — not bad for a digital currency that started as a joke.
    

            It is the No. 5 most-valuable cryptocurrency on the market, according to CoinMarketCap, having increased more than 6,000% this year. 
    

            The price of a dogecoin doubled again Friday after Tesla
            
                (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk tweeted about it for the umpteenth time (more on that in a bit). Demand for Dogecoin spiked so much in April, it briefly broke Robinhood’s cryptocurrency trading system. 
    

            Like all cryptocurrencies, dogecoin is a digital currency that can be bought and sold like an investment and spent like money.
    

            Although each crypto is unique, it shares some similarities with its better-known peers — its code is based off the script for litecoin, for example. But it has a couple key differences. 
    

            Unlike bitcoin, which has set 21 million as the finite amount of the digital currency, dogecoin has 129 billion coins in circulatIon and will continue to make new blocks of coins available to mine each year. That’s part of the reason one dogecoin is currently valued at about three dimes and a bitcoin is worth about $62,000.
    

            Although cryptos are gaining more acceptance as a currency for purchasing goods, dogecoin doesn’t have much mainstream real-world use. It has a few niche markets, including using dogecoin to tip online artists. 
    

            And its main differentiator — its active online community — is what makes the odd-ball currency so fun. The group, which is active on Reddit, has raised money (in dogecoin, of course) for charitable causes, and in 2014 it successfully crowdfunded a sponsorship to get Nascar driver Josh Wise to advertise dogecoin on his car.
    

            “Dogecoin is not so much an alternative deflationary numismatic instrument as it is an inflationary leisured exploration of community-building around a cryptoasset,” wrote Usman Chohan, economist at the University of New South Wales Business School, in a paper updated in February about the digital currency.
    

            Dogecoin was created December 6, 2013, by a pair of software engineers as a joke.
    

            Billy Markus, an IBM programmer from Portland, Oregon, set to differentiate his crypto from bitcoin, which was steeped in mystery with an anonymous creator and at the time attracted a small, niche group of miners. Markus wanted his cryptocurrency to be open to the masses, according to Chohan.
    

            Markus looked for help making his weird dream a reality and found Jackson Palmer, who worked for Adobe
            
                (ADBE). Palmer purchased the domain dogecoin.com — a nod to the “doge” meme that was all over the internet at the time.
    

            The website nods to its joke origins at the very top: Its Shiba Inu mascot is the first image on the page, mimicking the meme that inspired it, which features the same dog surrounded by a bunch of Comic Sans text in broken English. 
    

            On dogecoin.com, its mascot is captioned: “Dogecoin is an open source peer-to-peer digital currency, favored by Shiba Inus worldwide.”
    

            Dogecoin is no longer a joke. Its popularity has soared — astronomically, this year — buoyed in part by the mainstream adoption of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
    

            But Elon Musk is the loudest and most prominent supporter of dogecoin. One of his bizarre tweets to his 50 million followers can send the crypto surging. That’s what happened in April, when Musk tweeted “Doge Barking at the moon” and shared a photo of a painting by Spanish artist Joan Miró, which is titled “Dog Barking at the Moon.”

            Dogecoin has also enjoyed something of a cult status on internet message board Reddit, where a popular group — not unlike the WallStreetBets group behind GameStop’s rally — decided earlier this year to propel its value “to the moon.” Dogecoin soared over 600% in the wake of that push.
    

            Whether or not its a smart investment remains an active question. The more-actively traded and more-widely accepted bitcoin is subject to extreme volatility, so dogecoin, too, could crumble without warning. But its rise this year has been stunning.
    

            Not benefiting from the coin’s soaring growth is Markus, who sold all his dogecoin when he was laid off in 2015. He used it to buy a Honda Civic.

The last Roaring Twenties ended in disaster. Should investors be worried?,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/25/investing/stocks-week-ahead/index.html,"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            If this is a new Roaring Twenties for stocks and the economy, do we need to worry about how the 1920s ended?
    

            There has been a lot of talk about how the combination of massive economic stimulus and vaccines for Covid-19 could bring about a lengthy financial boom — just as there was during the 1920s after the end of the influenza pandemic.
    

            But if you follow this analogy to its conclusion, there could be a major cause for concern. After all, the 1920s ended with the Black Tuesday stock market crash in October 1929 — right at the onset of the Great Depression.  
    

            “The Roaring Twenties were a great period of time for investors but they didn’t end well,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Schwab Center for Financial Research.

Are you ready for the Roaring '20s?


            Some experts worry that similar excesses could be building now in the stock market and economy. You see it with the rise of meme stocks like GameStop
            
                (GME), the surge in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and the unrelenting runup in US housing prices. 
    

            Still, that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s time to panic and start preparing for another significant upheaval.
    

            “Another Great Depression scenario is hard to see,” said Troy Gayeski, co-chief investment officer of SkyBridge Capital. 
    

            Gayeski noted that many big businesses and consumers have stockpiled cash. The personal savings rate in the US is currently hovering just under 14% — compared to 7.6% in January 2020. 
    

            This cushion should prevent the economy from going into free fall even if there is more volatility in stocks. 
    

            “I don’t think a short-term hangover will lead to a multi-year downturn,” Gayeski said. 
    

            Frederick agreed that investors are not worrying about a meltdown, in part because stocks already took a massive hit last year due to the pandemic — and quickly recovered.
    

            Wall Street is also hopeful that economic policymakers, most notably Treasury Secretary (and former Federal Reserve chair) Janet Yellen and current Fed chair Jerome Powell, will not do anything rash that risks jeopardizing the recovery of the economy or market. 
    

            “There is a lot of confidence in Yellen. She knows what she’s doing. And the Fed won’t raise rates aggressively,” said Louis Navellier, chief investment officer of Navellier & Associates. 
    

            That should keep the economy and financial markets humming along. Of course, there will likely be corrections along the way. That’s only natural. 
    

            But Gayeski said it’s hard to imagine inflation roaring back in such dramatic fashion that it would lead the Fed, which meets again on Wednesday, to change course. 
    

            Absent that, the Fed can stay on hold and investors won’t have to worry that the central bank will grind the economy to a halt with big rate hikes.
    

            “Covid dealt such a massive body blow to the economy but there has been unprecedented monetary and fiscal stimulus and the markets have responded to that. At some point, the Fed may have to gradually let up on the accelerator. But not right now,” he said.
    

            Warren Buffett’s “Woodstock for Capitalists” will be a virtual affair for the second straight year due to the pandemic. 
    

            Instead of tens of thousands of people flocking to Nebraska, investors must settle for tuning into Yahoo Finance’s webcast of the Berkshire Hathaway
            
                (BRKB) shareholder meeting on Saturday May 1. 
    

            And this year, it will be a Hollywood affair. Buffett will be holding the meeting in Los Angeles — the hometown of Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger.

            Expect Buffett (and Munger) to talk about the stock market comeback and top Berkshire holdings like Apple

                (KO). 
    

            They also could discuss the rise of meme stocks and short-term investing, the possibility of higher taxes on the wealthy and any updates on Berkshire Hathaway succession planning. 
    

            Buffett turns 91 in August. Munger is 97. Berkshire’s two other vice chairmen, Ajit Jain and Greg Abel, will also be on the webcast — and they are both expected to take on even more responsibility in the eventual post-Buffett era.

Small investors are taking an unexpected break. Here's why,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/12/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Hot Stocks

            After a raucous start to the year, Wall Street expected non-professional traders to pump chunks of their $1,400 stimulus checks into the stock market, supporting popular names like Tesla
            
                (TSLA) and Apple
            
                (AAPL). So far, that doesn’t appear to be happening.
    

            Breaking it down: Retail investors who helped power GameStop mania haven’t been rushing to buy their favorite tech names, meme stocks or short-dated call options with the ferocity they exhibited in late January and early February. Daily net purchases of US equities by retail traders dipped in late March, just as stimulus checks were hitting bank accounts, data from Vanda Research’s VandaTrack shows.
    

            Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said this is a major reason that the VIX, a measure of US stock market volatility, recently fell to its lowest level since February 2020.
    

            “The drop in the VIX is in part due to less retail speculation and call buying,” Boockvar told me.
    

            What’s caused these traders to take their foot off the pedal? As inflation fears ricocheted across markets, stocks that had exhibited lots of momentum, benefitting the retail crowd, started to reverse course. Apple dropped 8% in February, while Tesla shed more than 15% in February and March.
    

            That spooked small investors, who are very sensitive to these changes, Vanda Research cofounder Eric Liu said. When the value of retail portfolios falls back, that often leads to changes in buying habits.
    

            “There’s a clear relationship between how retail performs today and their proclivity to invest tomorrow,” Liu said.
    

            He doesn’t expect retail to stay on the sidelines indefinitely, though there’s a sense now that investors are looking for their next obsession. Recently, there’s been significant investment in broad exchange-traded funds, which indicates there’s not a lot of conviction about the Next Big Thing, Liu added.
    

            If Big Tech starts to consistently rally again, the calculus could change, and February’s fears may be cast aside. FAANG stocks — Facebook
            
                (FB), Apple, Amazon, Netflix
            
                (NFLX) and Google — plus Microsoft make up about 28% of the typical retail portfolio, according to Vanda Research.
    

            “If you get those big growth names outperforming again … then you see retail come back in again,” Liu said.
    

            On the radar: This could happen before long. Apple, Amazon and Microsoft have already gained 9% in April, while Google parent Alphabet
            
                (GOOGL) has added more than 10%. With earnings season coming up, strong results could help these stocks move higher, encouraging retail to rejoin the fold. 
    

            But they also remain exposed to concerns about higher prices once the economic recovery takes off — a trend that hurts fast-growing shares.
    

            “If there’s one thing that upsets the apple cart, it’s a move higher with rates and inflation,” Boockvar said.
    

            Alibaba
            
                (BABA) is trying to draw a line under accusations that it behaved like a monopoly after Chinese regulators hit the online shopping giant with a record fine over the weekend. But that doesn’t mean the crackdown on tech in China is over, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports.

Alibaba's record fine is a 'warning shot' in China's tech crackdown


            The latest: Joe Tsai, Alibaba Group’s co-founder and executive vice chairman, told investors on Monday that the company will not appeal the 18.2 billion yuan ($2.8 billion) penalty that China’s State Administration for Market Regulation imposed on the business.
    

            Regulators had investigated Alibaba for “exclusive dealing agreements” that prevented merchants from selling products on rival e-commerce platforms. 
    

            The fine is equivalent to 4% of Alibaba’s sales in China in 2019, state news agency Xinhua reported, and dwarfs the previous record penalty of $975 million handed out to American chipmaker Qualcomm in 2015.
    

            It could have been worse, and the outcome has removed a key source of uncertainty for Alibaba and its investors. Shares rallied 6.5% in Hong Kong on Monday, though the stock is still down more than 20% since last November, when regulators pulled affiliate Ant Group’s highly-anticipated public offering. The company’s stock in New York is up 6% in premarket trading.
    

            But Wall Street shouldn’t get complacent.
    

            The fine is a “warning shot across the bow for the entire big tech sector in China,” said Alex Capri, a research fellow at Hinrich Foundation and a visiting senior fellow at National University of Singapore.
    

            Brock Silvers, managing director of Chinese private equity firm Kaiyuan Capital, said the incident is an example of how “opaque policy and private political maneuvering” can suddenly erase shareholder wealth.
    

            “Regulators are now preparing to increase their battle against China’s corporate titans, which should be quite worrisome to global investors who may be increasingly exposed to China risks that have long been unseen and remain unquantifiable,” Silvers said.
    

            Stock in Levi Strauss
            
                (LEVI) is soaring as people get ready to squeeze into their denim again.
    

            The latest: Shares of the company, which went public in 2019, are at an all-time high after the company reported earnings last week, my CNN Business colleague Paul R. La Monica reports. 
    

            Overall sales were down due to store closures tied to the pandemic. But the company said digital sales soared more than 40%, and now account for more than a quarter of overall revenue.
    

            Levi Strauss CEO Chip Bergh told analysts that a “denim resurgence” is boosting the entire casual clothing industry. It helps that for many, workwear is expected to stay relatively casual even after people return to the office.
    

            “I feel much more confident today than I did even a month ago about our ability to come through this pandemic in a much stronger position,” Bergh said.
    

            Investor insight: Levi’s stock has rallied 28% this year. Rival Kontoor Brands
            
                (KTB), which owns Wrangler and Lee, has jumped more than 40%.
    

            Coming tomorrow: The US Consumer Price Index will shine a light on whether prices are increasing as the recovery gathers steam.

Is Dubai-based Baraka the Middle East's answer to Robinhood?,https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/18/middleeast/baraka-dubai-middle-east-robinhood-spc-intl/index.html,"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            The world of investment is evolving fast, with amateur trading becoming increasingly mainstream.
    

            The power of the amateur became apparent in January, when millions of Reddit users and finance outsiders began a coordinated investment in US video game store GameStop pushing up the share price by 1,700% and angering professional hedge fund managers who were betting against the stock. 
    

            The growth of non-professional traders is partly the result of online trading platforms such as Robinhood and eToro, which provide inexperienced investors with commission-free access to stock markets.

            “There is a liberalization or democratization of the access to markets,” says Yaser AbuShaban, senior investments adviser at asset management firm Mercer Consulting. “Technological innovation has allowed this disruption into the trading systems.”
    

            But it’s still hard for most people to compete with professional traders. Amateurs often lack the necessary knowledge of the market and its risks, while accessing reliable real-time financial data through subscription services can be prohibitively expensive.  
    

            Now Dubai-based start-up Baraka wants to change that. It’s launching a mobile app that will let users across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) directly trade around 4,000 stocks (including all Nasdaq and Dow Jones companies) and exchange traded funds in the US market – without paying commission.
    

            It is similar to established trading apps, but Robinhood is only available to people with a US social security number, and Baraka says it has a bigger focus than e-Toro on providing financial news and financial education resources. Through podcasts, infographics, short videos and daily newsletters in English and Arabic, Baraka wants to help inexperienced traders understand financial markets and trading risks.
    

            “We want people to feel empowered, to know what they are investing in,” says Baraka’s CEO and founder, Feras Jalbout. “We provide a lot of free content that relates to financial markets.”
    

            Although the app is free, there is an option to pay to access additional analytics and research.
    

            With his platform, Jalbout is targeting Millennials in the region. “There is a massive gap in the market related to educational content or current events that speak to our demographic,” he says. Jalbout adds that many younger people in the region “don’t even know what a stock is and they don’t necessarily follow the news the same way as previous generations.”

            It’s already been dubbed the Middle East’s answer to Robinhood, but Baraka has a distinctive feature: to protect inexperienced users, it doesn’t allow some of the high-risk trades – such as derivatives and margin trading options – that have drawn criticism on other platforms.

            Robinhood was recently sued for the wrongful death of a 20-year-old student who died by suicide after mistakenly believing he owed $730,000 on his trading account balance. The student’s parents accused Robinhood of luring inexperienced investors to take big risks in sophisticated financial instruments such as options trading, without providing the necessary customer support and investment guidance.
    

            In a statement at the time, Robinhood said it had made a series of improvements to its options offering, including providing guidance to help customers, updates on how it displays buying power and live voice support for customers.
    

            AbuShaban says traders need to understand how to invest in what can be a stressful environment, and have a long-term goal of financial and mental well-being.
    

            “With the democratization of access comes the responsibility of individuals in terms of educating themselves, but it’s also the responsibility of companies  to educate and inform on the financial and mental risks associated with trading on the markets,” AbuShaban explains.
    

            Jalbout remains confident his platform could bridge the gap between hedge fund managers and amateur traders. “We don’t expect anyone to be a professional investor,” he says, “we just want to get people invested, and empower them.”

            Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway
            
                (BRKB) vice chairman Charlie Munger are not big fans of short-term trading and the popular Robinhood app. But it appears that Robinhood has no time for Buffett or Munger either. 
    

            Buffett said in Saturday’s annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meeting that the rise of Robinhood is “a very significant part of the casino aspect” of the stock market in the past year. 
    

            “There’s nothing illegal about it, there’s nothing immoral. But I don’t think you build a society around people doing it,” he said. 
    

            Buffett is not a fan of the company’s business model, he added. The app allows people to make multiple stock trades a day for free, instead making money from options trading and order flow revenue that big market makers pay Robinhood to execute trades. 
    

            Munger went a step further, saying that it is “God-awful that something like that would draw investment from civilized men and decent citizens. It’s deeply wrong.”
    

            Robinhood quickly fired back.

            “There is an old guard that doesn’t want average Americans to have a seat at the Wall Street table so they will resort to insults,” said the company in a statement Saturday that did not mention Buffett or Munger by name.
    

            “Adversaries of this future and of change are usually those who’ve enjoyed plentiful privileges in the past and who don’t want these privileges disrupted,” Robinhood added, saying that the “criticisms are unfortunate” and the “new generation of investors aren’t a ‘casino group.’”
    

            Robinhood went a step further Monday morning, putting out a lengthy blog post headlined”The old guard of investing is at it again” — this time specifically citing Buffett and Munger. 
    

            “Two of the most iconic investors insulted a new generation this weekend. Why? Because we are doing things a new way,” wrote Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay, Robinhood’s head of public policy communications, in the post. 
    

            Ramsay added that “people are tired of the Warren Buffetts and Charlie Mungers of the world acting like they are the only oracles of investing. And at Robinhood, we’re not going to sit back while they disparage everyday people for taking control of their financial lives.”
    

            She noted that “Robinhood has made investing simpler and more accessible to more people” and that “it is clear that the elites benefited from a stock market that kept many families sidelined from participating while they amassed huge wealth from decades of investing.”
    

            The comments are another sign of how Robinhood has been on the defensive as of late.
    

            Robinhood has already faced the spotlight for its role in the “meme stock” revolution earlier this year. The company was criticized for temporarily not allowing customers to buy shares of GameStop
            
                (GME) and other stocks popular with the Reddit WallStreetBets community.
    

            And Robinhood is bracing for even more scrutiny as it plans to go public later this year. Buffett said Saturday that he’s looking forward to eventually reading the company’s regulatory statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

            A bubble could be brewing in steel stocks.
    

            The pandemic brought the American steel industry to its knees last spring, forcing manufacturers to shut down production as they struggled to survive the imploding economy. But as the recovery got underway, mills were slow to resume production, and that created a massive steel shortage.
    

            Now, the reopening of the economy is driving a steel boom so strong that some are convinced it will end in tears.
    

            “This is going to be short-lived. It’s very appropriate to call this a bubble,” Bank of America analyst Timna Tanners told CNN Business, using the “b-word” that equity analysts from major banks typically avoid.
    

        The correction will be very intense. It’s just a matter of when and how it happens.” 
    

        Phil Gibbs, director of metals equity research at KeyBanc Capital Markets
    

            After bottoming out around $460 last year, US benchmark hot-rolled coil steel prices are now sitting at around $1,500 a ton, a record high that is nearly triple the 20-year average.
    

            Steel stocks are on fire. US Steel
            
                (X), which crashed to a record low last March amid bankruptcy fears, has skyrocketed 200% in just 12 months. Nucor
            
                (NUE) has spiked 76% this year alone.
    

            While “scarcity and panic” are lifting steel prices and stocks today, Tanners predicted a painful reversal as supply catches up with what she described as unimpressive demand.
    

            “We expect this will correct — and often when it corrects, it over-corrects,” said Tanners, a two-decade veteran of the metals industry who authored a report last week headlined “Steel stocks in a bubble.”
    

            Phil Gibbs, director of metals equity research at KeyBanc Capital Markets, agreed that steel prices are at unsustainable levels.
    

            “This would be like $170-a-barrel oil. At some point, people will say, ‘F this, I’m not going to drive, I will take the bus,’” Gibbs told CNN Business. “The correction will be very intense. It’s just a matter of when and how it happens.”

            Gibbs said he is “more confident the steel price is in a bubble,” rather than that steel stocks themselves are in a bubble.
    

            The steel bubble buzz is just the latest debate about the sustainability of booming pockets of the market in this era of rock-bottom interest rates. Bitcoin, ethereum, dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies are on fire. GameStop
            
                (GME), AMC
            
                (AMC) and their fellow Reddit-fueled stocks skyrocketed earlier this year. And blank-check companies, some backed by celebrities, are raising gobs of money.
    

            Even Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has acknowledged the risk of overspeculation. 
    

            “You are seeing things in capital markets that are a bit frothy,” Powell said during last week’s press conference. “That’s a fact. I won’t say it has nothing to do with monetary policy, but also it has a tremendous amount to do with vaccination and reopening of the economy.”
    

            Steel is just the latest shortage to hit the US economy as it recovers from a pandemic that scrambled supply chains and set off sharp shifts in demand. 
    

            Everything from computer chips and lumber to chlorine and tanker truck drivers are in short supply. Manufacturers, restaurants and other businesses are also desperate for workers. 
    

            Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency warned this week that there isn’t enough  copper, lithium and other raw earth minerals available to make global clean energy ambitions a reality. The world risks “running out of copper,” Bank of America strategists said in a recent note to clients.

            Much like lumber, the steel industry was caught off guard by the rapid recovery in demand that began last summer — especially in the auto industry.
    

            “All of a sudden people were buying lots of cars,” said Tanners, the Bank of America analyst. 
    

            And it took time for America’s aging steel mills to resume the production they had sharply cut at the onset of the pandemic. Steel inventories shrank rapidly and shipments were delayed, just as steel buyers began ordering more than usual.
    

            The good news, for steel buyers at least, is that analysts say all of the US steel production capacity that was idled during the pandemic has returned. 
    

            That’s why Tanners said she’s very confident the shortage will soon end, causing steel prices to collapse. History shows that steel stocks “tend to peak” a month or so before steel prices, Tanners wrote in her report. 
    

            She said US Steel in particular is vulnerable to a commodity downturn because it has the most amount of debt and the greatest need to spend to upgrade its plants.

            But for now, steel stocks may continue to look attractive to investors because the industry is minting money at the moment. The North American flat steel sector is expected to generate record earnings in 2021, according to Citigroup. 
    

            “Current steel prices are peak (or close to it) … and will correct sharply lower at some point,” Citi analyst Alexander Hacking wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. “The current scenario presents investors with the classic peak earnings dilemma.”
    

            Hacking warned though that steel stocks can’t escape a commodity downturn. “We can recall exactly zero examples where steel equities have gone up during 25%+ metal price corrections,” he wrote. 
    

            Of course, those predicting a steel downturn may be underestimating the strength of the global economic recovery. A longer lasting boom could lift steel demand enough to keep prices lofty. Another risk is whether tougher environmental regulations in China will limit steel supply there.
    

            One big wildcard is the fate of the tariffs on most imported steel the Trump administration imposed in 2018 to boost the domestic industry. 
    

            If the Biden administration rolls back even just some of those tariffs, it would ease supply constraints and weigh on steel prices.  
    

            Tanners thinks that is likely to happen in the next 12 months. 
    

            “We are protecting an industry where there is scarcity and prices are almost triple historical averages,” she said.

So your teen wants to be the next Warren Buffett? Fidelity has an account for that,https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/18/investing/fidelity-teens-investing/index.html,"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Hot Stocks 




            Warren Buffett, the world’s most famous investor, is 90. But there are plenty of people  much, much younger who are interested in stocks. Fidelity is going after that market.
    

            The brokerage giant announced Tuesday that it is setting up a new Fidelity Youth Account plan for 13- to 17-year olds. The teens’ parents must already have Fidelity accounts, and the moms and dads will have full access to monitor their kids’ spending and investing activity. 
    

            A spokesman for Fidelity said in an email to CNN Business that parents and children both must sign customer agreements but “ultimately the parent is responsible for the activity in the account.” Teenage investors will have some autonomy, however, as parental approval is not required to make transactions.
    

            Fidelity said that teenage clients will be able to buy and sell stocks, ETFs and mutual funds. They’ll also have the option to purchase fractional shares of higher-priced stocks for as little as $1. And once the teen turns 18, the youth account automatically transitions into a standard one. 
    

            The new accounts will have no commissions or other fees, no minimum balance requirements and come with a debit card. 
    

            The teens’ accounts don’t include any access or links to their parents’ accounts. So moms and dads won’t have to worry about junior tanking their retirement portfolios with rogue stock picks.

            “Fidelity is committed to responsibly supporting young investors,” Jennifer Samalis, senior vice president of acquisition and loyalty at Fidelity Investments, said in a press release. “Importantly, our goal for the Fidelity Youth Account is to encourage young Americans to learn through action and foster meaningful family conversations around financial topics.”
    

            It may seem admirable that Fidelity is promoting financial literacy and encourage teens to invest in their future. 
    

            Still, the announcement comes at an interesting time given what’s happening in the stock market -— particularly among younger Gen Z and millennial investors. 
    

            Fidelity rival Robinhood, which is looking to go public soon, has come under scrutiny for allowing, and perhaps even encouraging, risky behavior among some individual investors. 
    

            The rise of meme stocks like GameStop
            
                (GME) and AMC
            
                (AMC) also have fueled concerns that average traders are making reckless choices with their money.
    

            The Fidelity spokesman said that parents who are worried about what their kids are buying and selling can sign up for mobile transaction alerts. He added that per IRS gifting rules, only $30,000 can be deposited into the teens’ accounts each year. 
    

            Teens also will not be allowed to trade on margin or in super-risky investments such as options or leveraged ETFs, the spokesman said. Teen clients can also withdraw money from their Fidelity accounts and transfer it to a 529 account for college savings.

            Fidelity maintains that it’s better for people to learn about investing at an early age. 
    

            “The account is charting a new course by providing the ability for teens to build healthy money habits through learning by doing,” Samalis said. 
    

            When you think about it, Fidelity makes perfect sense as a company that would look to let teens — who are often economic and retail trendsetters — cash in on their generation’s prodigious purchasing power.  
    

            After all, Fidelity is the company that is famous for employing superstar fund manager Peter Lynch, who espoused the investing mantra “buy what you know.”
    

            I’ll have to wait a while until my older son — who’s 11 going on 16 — is old enough to take a crack at making his own stock picks. But I’d venture his buy-what-you-know portfolio would include Apple
            
                (AAPL), Chipotle
            
                (CMG), Disney
            
                (DIS), Netflix
            
                (NFLX), Roku
            
                (ROKU) and YouTube owner Alphabet
            
                (GOOGL). 
    

            For what it’s worth, those stocks have all done pretty well over the past few years.

            You’ve probably heard of the FAANG stocks: Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google owner Alphabet. But it’s the BANG stocks of Reddit WallStreetBets meme fame that are now taking the investing world by storm.
    

            BlackBerry. AMC. Nokia. GameStop. This quartet, along with others such as insurance startup Clover Health, mobile shopping app developer ContextLogic and fast food chain Wendy’s, have become darlings of the Reddit crowd.


            So why do some stocks go from being unloved on Wall Street to diehard favorites of the Reddit army? 
    

            What all these stocks have in common is that a fair number of short sellers are betting against them. 
    

            And that riles the passions of the Reddit crowd, many of whom view short-selling -— when an investor borrows a stock and sells it with hopes of buying it back at a lower price and pocketing the difference as a profit — as a rigged part of the investing game designed to benefit fat cat hedge funds.

            The Reddit crew is looking for underdogs that Wall Street pros think are relics: BlackBerry
            
                (BB) and Nokia
            
                (NOK) got left behind when everybody started buying iPhones and Androids, while AMC
            
                (AMC) and GameStop
            
                (GME) have both been hit hard by the pandemic, plus shifts in how people watch movies and play video games.
    

            “Shorts have some tricks for us today. But today we set it up,” wrote one Redditor on Thursday about AMC, GameStop and Tilray
            
                (TLRY), a cannabis company that is also heavily shorted. “We battle the shorts. We stay strong; Monday we’ll be in orbit and complete control.”
    

            The term “meme stock” may sometimes be used pejoratively, but the fact is Reddit investors are sophisticated enough to realize that by targeting stocks that are heavily shorted and don’t have a sizable amount of shares available for trading, there’s a chance to help fuel what’s known as a short squeeze. 
    

            A squeeze takes place when short-sellers have to rush to repurchase shares they borrowed because the price is rising. 
    

            The higher a shorted stock goes, the more money the short-seller stands to lose. So they have to often quickly buy the stock back to avoid losing their shirts — thus pushing the price even higher.

AMC shares soar to an all-time high


            If a short-seller borrows a stock trading at $50 and sells it but the stock then climbs to $75, that’s a $25 loss. If it goes to $100, the short is $50 in the red, and so on. They want to get out quickly to reduce their losses, and that creates the squeeze.
    

            “This is the perfect storm for an epic short squeeze: the mother of all short squeezes,” said one Reddit user about AMC on Thursday. The poster even went on to declare that AMC is the “safest bet” on Wall Street — and emphasized that by using several rocket emojis. 
    

            Of course, AMC is not a “safe” stock per se. A lot can go wrong with the reopening of the economy. And even if things go smoothly, some argue the shares, which are now up more than 2,000% already in 2021, could eventually cool off.
    

            Still, investors who bet against the meme stocks need to realize that the so-called apes, a term that many investors on Reddit use to describe themselves, are playing the long game. They are not necessarily looking to always cash in after making a quick buck.
    

            “We are in this for the long haul,” said one Reddit user in a post about GameStop, BlackBerry, AMC and ContextLogic, adding that the stocks are “absolutely primed for a squeeze.”
    

            The support of the Reddit crowd is grabbing attention from the meme stocks’ management teams, too.
    

Clover Health CEO Vivek Garipalli gave them a shoutout on  the company’s earnings call with analysts last month: “We are also including some questions from the strong community of Clover investors on Reddit. As a quick aside, we are a big believer in the retail investor community.”

            AMC has even launched a rewards program for loyal retail investors. 
    

            “I’m quite optimistic about the new shareholder base of AMC,” said AMC CEO Adam Aron on its earnings call last month. “Just go on Twitter, just go on Reddit, just go on YouTube. Read what these people write. They love AMC.” 
    

            “These are not people who are just going to be investors in AMC. These are going to be customers of AMC who come to our theaters and enjoy watching movies at our theaters as paying guests,” he added. “So I love the idea that we have a passionate, committed, enthusiastic shareholder base.”
    

            Meanwhile, not all Reddit-approved stocks are wrapped up in a battle between retail investor longs and hedge fund short sellers. Just look at Wendy’s
            
                (WEN). Hedge fund Trian, run by Nelson Peltz, is the top shareholder.
    

            So it seems the key to finding a stock primed for a Reddit bump is to identify companies that don’t have a lot of shares available for trading. It’s easy to propel those stocks higher.
    

            That was the case with Wendy’s earlier this week, as one Reddit user noted that “frenzy+scarcity+low volume means minimal buys could push the price quickly.”

            Hot Stocks 




            Move over, AMC and GameStop. Wendy’s is the latest hot stock with the WallStreetBets crowd.


            Shares of Wendy’s
            
                (WEN) surged more than 25% in late afternoon trading Tuesday after Reddit investing communities started circulating bullish comments about the fast food chain, talking up the company’s irreverent social media feed and its “chicken tendies” that make it  “literally the perfect stock for this sub.” 
    

            But Wendy’s isn’t like quite the same as AMC
            
                (AMC), GameStop
            
                (GME) or most other stocks favored by the Reddit traders. Notably, it’s not a company that many short-selling hedge funds are betting against. 
    

            In fact, Wendy’s top shareholder is hedge fund Trian, run by Nelson Peltz. Trian holds about a 12% stake in the company while Petlz personally owns another 7% of the firm. Top mutual fund companies Vanguard and BlackRock each have more than 7% stakes, too.

            Still, that could be a recipe for a big stock surge. One investor on Reddit noted earlier this week that the fact that the stock is so widely owned by insiders and big institutional firms could make it ripe for a pop.
    

            “Frenzy+scarcity+low volume means minimal buys could push the price quickly,” the Reddit user wrote.
    

            Other Reddit users noted that the Wendy’s social media team has a knack for dunking on McDonald’s
            
                (MCD) and other competitors on Twitter. That irreverence could help gain the company new investors as well. 
    

            Wendy’s relishes in the social media notoriety, describing its Twitter feed like this: “We like our tweets the same way we like to make our hamburgers: better than anyone expects from a fast food joint.”
    

            And some Reddit users also were quick to point out the delicious irony of the fact that Wendy’s investors were generating big “tendies” — a term that is both WSB code for trading profits as well as a nickname for Wendy’s chicken nuggets.

Robinhood slapped with biggest-ever penalty by Wall Street regulator,https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/investing/robinhood-trading-fine-finra/index.html,"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Robinhood is being ordered to pay about $70 million for harming millions of customers. It’s the largest penalty ever imposed by Wall Street’s self-regulator.
    

            The controversial trading app was accused Wednesday by the Financial Industrial Regulatory Authority of “systemic supervisory failures” and hurting investors by giving them “false or misleading information.”
    

            FINRA’s sanctions on Robinhood focus on large-scale system outages that hit the platform in March 2020 as well as the options trading procedures at the heart of a lawsuit filed by the family of a 20-year-old Robinhood trader who died by suicide last year. 


            “The fine imposed in this matter, the highest ever levied by FINRA, reflects the scope and seriousness of Robinhood’s violations,” Jessica Hopper, head of FINRA’s department of enforcement, said in a statement.

            FINRA fined Robinhood $57 million and ordered the startup to pay about $12.6 million in restitution, plus interest, to thousands of harmed customers. 
    

            Robinhood neither admitted to nor denied the charges.
    

            Alluding to Robinhood’s Silicon Valley roots, Hooper said that compliance with FINRA’s rules “is not optional” and can’t be sacrificed by a willingness to “‘break things’ and fix them later.”
    

            In a statement, Robinhood noted that it has heavily invested in improving the platform’s stability, educational offerings, customer support and legal teams.
    

            “We are glad to put this matter behind us and look forward to continuing to focus on our customers and democratizing finance for all,” a Robinhood spokesperson said in the statement.
    

            FINRA said that “despite Robinhood’s self-described mission to ‘de-mystify finance for all,’ its investigation found that the startup has “negligently communicated false and misleading information” related to critical issues since September 2016. 
    

            Examples include whether customers could place trades on margin, how much cash is in customers’ accounts, how much buying power customers have and the risk of loss customers face in options transactions.

            FINRA specifically pointed to Alexander Kearns, the 20-year-old trader who died by suicide in June 2020 after he saw a negative balance of $730,000 in his trading account and mistakenly believed that was the sum of money he owed. The tragedy drew attention to the gamified nature of the Robinhood platform and the startup’s customer service shortfalls. Robinhood executives have said they were “devastated” by Kearns’ death and have made a series of improvements to options trading since then.
    

            The FINRA investigation found that thousands of other customers suffered more than $7 million in total losses “due to Robinhood’s misstatements.”
    

            FINRA also concluded that since late 2017 when Robinhood launched options trading, the company “failed to exercise due diligence” before approving these sophisticated transactions. 
    

            Specifically, regulators said Robinhood relied on algorithms that “often” approved customers to trade options based on “inconsistent or illogical information.” Despite apparent “red flags,” Robinhood approved thousands of customers for options trading, FINRA said.
    

            At the same time, FINRA alleged that between January 2018 and February 2021, Robinhood “failed to reasonably supervise” the technology it relied on to execute trades. 
    

            The regulator noted that Robinhood experienced a serious of outages and system failures between 2018 and late 2020, including one in early March 2020 that caused individual customers to lose tens of thousands of dollars. FINRA said it is requiring Robinhood to pay more than $5 million to those impacted customers. 
    

            Robinhood set off a firestorm in January when it temporarily banned users from buying shares of GameStop
            
                (GME) and other stocks driven up by an army of traders on Reddit. Vlad Tenev, Robinhood’s CEO, was hauled before Congress for a hearing where he blamed the controversial restrictions on a demand from its clearinghouse to put up as much as $3 billion due to the market volatility.
    

            The FINRA sanctions remove one of the major black clouds hovering over Robinhood ahead of what could be a blockbuster initial public offering for the startup. Despite a series of public relations nightmares, Robinhood filed confidentially for an IPO in March. The offering could allow Robinhood to capitalize on its torrent growth and record high stock prices.

            But Robinhood is still facing scrutiny from regulators and politicians. 
    

            In particular, Gary Gensler, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, has repeatedly expressed concerns about the “inherent” conflicts of interest that exist in the payment-for-order flow business model used by Robinhood and other brokerages that don’t charge commissions.

            Retiring a millionaire isn’t as farfetched as it may seem. With a bit of saving, investing, and a proper plan, you can be well on your way to hitting $1 million – or more – by the time you reach retirement age. 
    

6 steps to avoid running out of money in retirementSelling your home? Here’s how accurate online estimates areBitcoin? Ethereum? Dogecoin? Your guide to the biggest names in crypto


            In fact, the number of retirement millionaires have reached record levels, according to data from Fidelity Investments, the nation’s largest provider of 401(k) savings plans. Retirement savers with a 401(k) balance of $1 million or more increased to 365,000 during the first quarter of 2021, while the number of those with an IRA with a balance of $1 million or more jumped up to 307,600. 
    

            Here’s how you can retire a millionaire: 
    

            Saving is the key to reaching almost any financial goal, especially if you want to retire with a million-dollar portfolio. But the trick isn’t necessarily how much you save, but when you start. 
    

            “One of the huge keys to success here is to take advantage of your biggest asset: time,” said Tony Molina, CPA and senior product specialist at Wealthfront.

            Most experts recommend contributing at least 10% to 15% of your income to your retirement fund. But if you’re not able to contribute that much, don’t let that discourage you. Saving any amount can put you significantly ahead in reaching your retirement goals, thanks to compound interest.
    

            Compound interest means that the money you initially invest will grow over time, on top of the interest that you incur moving forward.  
    

            That’s why starting early is so important. 
    

            “Compounding can lead to significant wealth building,” said Molina. “Even if it’s just a few hundred dollars each month, this adds up.”  
    

            The earlier the better, but it’s also important to map out a plan to reach your goals. 
    

            “Too often I see people saving for retirement without a plan in place. They are just putting money into an account without knowing if they are on track to save too much, too little, or just the right amount,” said Matthew Fleming, CFP and senior financial advisor with Vanguard Personal Advisor Services.
    

            So how much do you need to save? It all depends on when you start. Here are a few scenarios provided by Daniel Demian, financial advice expert at Albert,of how you can reach a million in retirement, depending on when you start: 
    

Starting at age 20: 


Starting at age 30: 


Starting at age 40: 


Starting at age 50: 


            Saving early and investing regularly is the key to hitting your retirement fund goals, but what you do with the money you save will help determine how fast you build wealth. 
    

            Most bank savings accounts are currently paying an average of just 0.03% APY, according to the FDIC. Your money will go a lot further if it’s invested. For example, stocks can provide the growth you need to build a large enough nest egg for retirement. The S&P 500 has returned an annualized average of roughly 10% in the last century. Most financial advisers recommend diversifying your retirement portfolio with a combination of stocks and bonds.

            Another important factor is what type of account you invest in.
    

             A tax deferred account – such as a 401(k) or IRA – allows you to postpone paying taxes on money you’ve invested until it is withdrawn from the account, typically in retirement. Another benefit to a 401(k) is that your employer might boost your retirement savings by kicking in some extra money. Check if your company offers matching contributions, and if so, you want to ensure you’re contributing enough to receive the full employer match. An option like a Roth IRA allows you to make contributions you’ve already paid taxes on, but then grow and withdraw the money tax-free. 
    

            But with any account or investment you choose, the younger you are, the more you can benefit from saving and investing your money. 
    

            “The more time you have in the markets, the more you benefit from the powers of compounding, so an early start is always advisable,” Fleming said.

            US stock indices remain in record territory. But in recent weeks, they’ve been stuck in a holding pattern as investors hunt for the next big catalyst that could send shares higher.
    

            In Europe, there’s no such hesitance.
    

            What’s happening: The STOXX 600 index hit an all-time high on Monday and is pushing higher again on Tuesday. Strategists think that after a decade of skepticism, European shares could continue to be solid bets in the months to come.
    

            “This is not 4 a.m. [at] the European party,” Jeffrey Sacks, head of investment strategy in Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Citi Private Bank, told me. “This is 9 p.m., so there’s a lot further to go.”
    

            For the past 10 years, investors have been wary about pumping money into Europe, which has been beset by low economic growth, a weak euro, political risk and a struggling banking sector, Sacks said.
    

            Now, he sees a different dynamic starting to play out, as EU member states start to spend money allocated through the bloc’s recovery fund and vaccination programs gather steam.
    

            JPMorgan predicts that €390 billion ($475 billion) in grants and €360 billion ($438 billion) in loans will start to be rolled out this year and money could continue to feed through until 2026.
    

            There are also structural reasons Europe appears poised for a breakout. The region has a high proportion of stocks like auto companies and banks that perform well when the economy is on the upswing. Many pay healthy dividends. The market relies less than the United States on shares of high-growth tech companies like Amazon and Apple
            
                (AAPL), which look less appealing when investors are concerned about interest rate hikes.
    

            “We upgraded our tactical view on European equities to neutral in February, and are seeing more reasons to be optimistic about this asset class for the next six to 12 months,” BlackRock strategists told clients on Monday.
    

            There are risks. Like the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank — which meets Thursday — is vulnerable to a policy mistake that could hamper the economic rebound. Fears about Covid variants are also stymying the summer tourism season for the second year in a row.
    

            But Sacks thinks that after many years of “disappointment,” this could be Europe’s time to shine, resulting in a US-style wave of mergers and acquisitions and even a retail trading frenzy.
    

            Not just the European Union: The United Kingdom could also experience growth after investors stayed on the sidelines for years due to Brexit, while Asian shares stand to benefit as the trade environment improves.
    

            Wall Street has long dominated markets. Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has rallied 236%, while Europe’s STOXX 600 rose roughly 86%, the FTSE 100 in London climbed about 27% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 56%. That means there’s lots of ground to make up.
    

            Wall Street thinks Biogen’s new Alzheimer’s drug is poised to be a huge success.
    

            On Monday, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the experimental drug aducanumab for early-stage Alzheimer’s patients. It’s the first treatment for the disease to receive a green light from the regulator in nearly 20 years.
    

            Shares of Biogen
            
                (BIIB), which developed the drug also known as Aduhelm with Japanese partner Eisai, surged 38% Monday.
    

            The drug was developed for patients with mild cognitive impairment, not severe dementia. It’s intended to slow progression of Alzheimer’s disease, not just ease symptoms, and could be used to treat millions of people.
    

            Massachusetts-based Biogen needs a new blockbuster medicine after generic versions of Tecfidera, its multiple sclerosis drug, arrived in the United States last year.
    

            Biogen’s revenue dropped 25% last quarter compared to the previous year. Chief Financial Officer Michael McDonnell said this decline “was mostly driven by the continued impact of Tecfidera generics in the United States.”
    

            Watch this space: Aduhelm, which received accelerated approval, will still be studied, and there is debate over its efficacy. An advisory committee concluded last year that there was not enough evidence to support the effectiveness of the treatment.
    

            “FDA will continue to monitor Aduhelm as it reaches the market and ultimately the patient’s bedside,” Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in Monday’s announcement.
    

            There are also concerns around cost. Biogen announced on Monday that the wholesale cost of treatment with aducanumab, which requires an infusion once every four weeks, carries an annual cost around $56,000 for a high dose.
    

            In the billionaire space race, Jeff Bezos is about to break new ground.
    

            The latest: Bezos will fly to space on the first crewed flight of the New Shepard, the rocket ship made by his space company, Blue Origin. The flight is scheduled for July 20, just 15 days after he’s set to step down as CEO of Amazon
            
                (AMZN). He’ll be joined by his brother.
    

            If all goes according to plan, Bezos — the world’s richest person, with a net worth of $187 billion — will be the first of the billionaire space tycoons to experience a ride aboard the rocket technology that he’s poured millions into developing, my CNN Business colleague Jackie Wattles reports.
    

            Not even Elon Musk, whose SpaceX builds rockets powerful enough to enter orbit around Earth, has announced plans to travel to space aboard one of his company’s crew capsules. British billionaire Richard Branson has long said he would be among the first passengers aboard Virgin Galactic’s rocket-powered plane, but that flight is expected to take place later in 2021.
    

            Investor insight: Bezos isn’t leaving Amazon entirely when his tenure as CEO ends, and will transition to the executive chairman role. Should investors be concerned, then, that the company’s founder and visionary is rocketing into space?
    

            The US trade balance for April posts at 8:30 a.m. ET, followed by data on job openings at 10 a.m. ET.
    

            Coming tomorrow: GameStop
            
                (GME) reports earnings as its stock continues to soar.
