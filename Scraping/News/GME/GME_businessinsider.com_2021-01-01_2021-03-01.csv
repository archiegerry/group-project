"The history of WallStreetBets, the Reddit group that upended the stock market with a campaign to boost GameStop","https://www.businessinsider.com/wallstreetbets-reddit-history-gme-gamestop-stock-dow-futures-yolo-2021-1","Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","Over the past week, stocks in GameStop, AMC theaters, and a multitude of other seemingly fading companies have soared in value. For stockbrokers and traders, these massive price hikes seem like an anomaly — but those plugged into the online forum Reddit aren't shocked. The spikes follow a targeted wave of enthusiasm aiming to boost the stock valuations from members of the subreddit r/wallstreetbets.
For many, the GameStop rally might be the first time they've heard of the community, but r/wallstreetbets is actually a relatively old subreddit with deep ties to internet culture.
The language used on posts in the community can be crude and boorish — they describe themselves as ""autists"" and proudly exclaim how little they know about the market. But if you can move past the crass outer shell, you can find an almost-coherent community of like-minded individuals who want to flip off the hedge fund managers and make money for the little guy. 
r/WallStreetBets has become a new training ground for would-be investors, aided by apps like Robinhood and WeBull that allow anyone with a bank account to become a trader. But how did this sub grow to nearly 5 million self-described ""degenerates"" and inspire scrutiny from the SEC?
The WallStreetBets subreddit was created in 2012 by Jaime Rogozinski while he was working as an information technology consultant for the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, DC according to the Wall Street Journal. The 39-year-old who lives in Mexico City found that while visiting internet forums in the early 2010s, he would be told by fellow investors that his investing style ""akin to gambling"" wasn't going to work out. 
""When I created the sub, I was looking for a community, a place for people to talk about high-risk trades in an unapologetic way for people to make some short term money with disposable income,"" Rogozinski told TMZ Live on Wednesday. ""The progression of WallStreeBets throughout the years has been nothing short of amazing."" 
 
Over the next few years, r/wallstreetbets remained fairly small and niche. According to subreddit stats, the sub didn't break 100,000 subscribers until 2017. During these early years, the sub was still trying to find its identity but it still had notable events.
Martin Shkreli, the ""pharma bro"" who is serving a seven-year prison sentence for securities fraud, was a common voice on the sub and a moderator. In June 2016, he proposed a ban on the word ""YOLO,"" meaning ""you only live once"" because the ""term undermines the central point of investing"" and ""this 'roll the dice' mentality is amateurish: I have never heard it in 15 years on Wall Street.""
The ""YOLO"" mentality of buying whatever is a crucial theme on the sub and is still commonly seen today. 
By 2020, the sub had ballooned to over a million subscribers and was full of novice traders sharing their gains, losses, and memes. Rogozinski published a book about his experience in January and in March announced the ""Wall Street Bet Championship."" This trading competition was to be held at the Esports Stadium Arlington and featured 12 contestants that would each put in $50,000. The event was sponsored by the True Trading Group, with moderator StormWillPass posting that users that want to talk ""negatively"" about the company will be ""banned."" 
 
This caused quite a bit of drama on the sub, with users finding connections between the moderators and the True Trading Group. According to the Daily Dot, moderator Arigold212855 appeared to admit in a leaked private message that ""TTG gave WSB 6 figures to back them"" and that they are a ""part owner of TTG."" In April of 2020, the sub mysteriously went private only for it to unprivate itself briefly to post a message from the moderators.
""WSB has been liberated,"" wrote mod ITradeBaconFutures. ""The OG mods are working to get the band back together with those that were run off.""
According to a message posted on the WallStreetBets Discord, Rogozinski had been removed as a moderator because ""he was found to be attempting to sell rights to the subreddit to a cut-rate trading team called 'True Trading Group.'"" When users tried to visit the sub, the message confirmed the founder's ousting. 
There's no record the Wall Street Bets Championship took place after the controversy. 
With an unshackled group of moderators, r/WallStreetBets was about to reach entirely new heights.
By mid-2020, constant posts about money made from Tesla trades and meme stocks, investments made that don't make sense by traditional metrics but simply catch-on online,  created a new gold rush, where users wanted to jump on that bandwagon to financial stability.  User ETHBAGHOLDER claimed that they turned $3,000 into $102,000 by taking investment advice from the sub. Another user, osbetel, claimed he turned $5,000 into over $300,000 by investing in Tesla. Deepf---ingValue has become a bit of a folk hero, posting daily updates on his ""YOLO"" stocks that he says he's invested nearly a million dollars into. 
By December of 2020, the sub had grown to 1.8 million subscribers and was full of screenshots of the app Robinhood, one of the more popular apps used to invest. 
In January 2021, with the pandemic raging and financial instability abound, the sub grew to previously unimaginable heights. It gained over two million subscribers in a few days and, and now has the most comments and posts created in one day on the entirety of Reddit according to subredditstats.
Thousands of new users flocked to the sub after users successfully popped the valuation of several stocks, including GameStop. Last week, GameStop stock was worth $40 but due to the purchasing efforts of the members of r/wallstreetbets, it ballooned to a high of $492. Purchasing power usually reserved for hedge funds was now in the hands of the people.
The subreddit's Discord server was banned on Wednesday, with the company telling The Verge that they ""decided to remove the server and its owner from Discord for continuing to allow hateful and discriminatory content after repeated warnings."" 
""We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad,"" mod zjz wrote in a post after the ban. ""Discord did us dirty and I am not impressed with them destroying our community.""
The sub has now gone mainstream, with even their idol Elon Musk tweeting about WallStreetBets. Robinhood and other trading apps have halted trading on GameStop stocks and the traditional world of money is having to come to terms with this ragtag group of users changing the shape of modern investing.

"Wall Street darling Ryan Cohen takes board seat at GameStop","https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-adds-chewy-ryan-cohen-wall-street-darling-to-board-2021-1","Mon, 11 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","The co-founder and CEO who convinced Wall Street that pets are big business has a new pet project: Turning around the fortunes of ailing games retailer GameStop.
Chewy co-founder and former CEO Ryan Cohen is taking a seat on the company's board, joining two former Chewy lieutenants, former CFO Jim Grube and former CMO Alan Attal, GameStop announced on Monday.
Together, pending a vote in June, the three former Chewy execs will make up a third of the newly-formed GameStop board of directors. 
It's the latest such move from Cohen and his venture firm, RC Ventures, following the sale of Chewy to PetSmart in 2017 for $3.35 billion. Cohen previously bought up a sizable chunk of GameStop shares, accumulating over 12% of the company by December 2020 and sending stock value soaring.
In September 2020, when Cohen initially purchased a significant chunk of the company's shares, he proposed a plan to the board to focus GameStop on ecommerce opportunities. One example of those opportunities is tied to GameStop's core business, reselling used games. Cohen reportedly proposed an online version of the retailer's well-known game trade-in program.
GameStop repeatedly cited Cohen and his former colleague's experience with ecommerce as critical to ther roles on the board. ""Their substantial e-commerce and technology expertise will help us accelerate our transformation plans and fully capture the significant growth opportunities ahead for GameStop,"" board chair Kathy Vrabeck said in the press release.

Despite being the world's largest video game retailer, GameStop has struggled in recent years to stay afloat amid increasing competition from digital game stores.
Like Blockbuster Video and Tower Records before it, video game retail stores are facing major challenges to their business model. As more people buy video games through digital storefronts like Steam or the Xbox Store, fewer buy games on physical discs from GameStop.
That trend was a huge problem for the company — at least until the coronavirus pandemic forced millions of people indoors. Many of those people, with loads of free time on their hands suddenly, turned to video games. Sales of video-game hardware, software, accessories, and game cards topped $1.6 billion for March, according to The NPD Group's monthly report — ""the highest reported spend for a March month since the $1.8 billion achieved in March 2008.""
By year's end, the video game industry's revenues had topped both sports and film combined, NPD found. GameStop's stock, meanwhile, has rebounded from about $5 per share in early January 2020 to nearly $20 per share by January 2021.

"The winners and losers — so far — in Reddit traders' war on Wall Street that sent GameStop shares skyrocketing","https://www.businessinsider.com/winners-losers-gamestop-reddit-wallstreetbets-traders-wall-street-short-squeeze-2021-1","Sat, 30 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","A Reddit community called r/WallStreetBets sent real-life Wall Street into a frenzy this week by taking on short sellers — investors who bet on companies doing worse, not better, in the future.
The group has been scooping up shares in struggling companies like GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Nokia, and others, pushing their share prices sky-high.
In the process, the day traders have tanked investors who bet against those companies: hedge funds and other establishment Wall Street firms that shorted GameStop have lost $19 billion so far this year.
Many analysts have speculated that this is a bubble and that share prices will eventually plummet, leaving those day traders stuck with massive losses, but the scale and speed at which day traders have been able to move share prices may signal we're in uncharted territory.
Either way, the influence of Wall Street Bets, which ballooned up to 6 million members this week, likely isn't going away anytime soon. So, after a week of massive volatility in the markets, here's who's in the money — and who's not.
Wall Street Bets members are mostly ""retail investors,"" non-professional individual investors who aren't part of financial firms like hedge funds, private equity firms, or investment banks.
As Insider's Ben Winck reported: ""Reddit's structure and the democratic nature of users picking the most popular content differs wildly from Wall Street's research reports and market analysis.""
By hyping up stocks and mobilizing the masses to get in on the action, these day traders boosted stocks to the surprise of many Wall Street firms.
The Redditor credited with helping light the match under GameStop claimed he turned $54,000 into $48 million.
But these traders' decisions to buy aren't always grounded in the ""fundamentals"" of how a business is performing, and if the market eventually cools on these stocks, they could be left out in the cold if they're unable to sell shares before the price drops.
Firms like Citadel, Melvin Capital, Cirtron, and Point72, which had bet against GameStop and other companies targeted by Wall Street Bets, bailed on their short positions after weeks of taking a beating.
GameStop short sellers alone are down $19 billion on the year.
Video game stores and movie theaters have not been doing well lately, especially during the pandemic. But thanks to the Reddit-fueled investing craze, GameStop stock is up 600% in the past three weeks, while AMC was up 300% — that's more cash in their coffers to bolster their businesses.
Other companies riding the wave include BlackBerry, Bed Bath & Beyond, Nokia, and American Airlines.
Not all of Wall Street is losing out on this shake up. Institutional investors who owned shares in companies like GameStop and AMC before they were targeted by Wall Street Bets are in great shape.
Silver Lake Partners, a private equity firm that held $600 million in AMC debt, cashed in on that investment this week by converting it to equity and getting out while it could — and turning a $113 million profit in doing so.
Wealthy individuals, even if they're operating independent of the Wall Street establishment, have money to throw around when opportunities like this pop up.
Billionaire investor Chamath Palihapitiya scored big — and cashed out — on his bullish $125,000 bet on GameStop, which at one point was up 300%.
Amid the frantic trading this week, popular free stock-trading apps like Robinhood restricted their users — many of whom are also members of Wall Street Bets — from buying the red-hot stocks.
That prompted swift backlash from those users, as well as lawmakers and regulators, who accused Robinhood and similar platforms of enabling Wall Street firms — which don't trade via Robinhood and were still able to buy and sell freely — to play by different rules.
""For years, the same hedge funds, private equity firms, and wealthy investors dismayed by the GameStop trades have treated the stock market like their own personal casino while everyone else pays the price,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Wednesday.
Warren and other progressives including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as a few far-right lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz, condemned the trading limits.
On Friday night, Robinhood published a blog post titled ""What happened this week,"" explaining the fallout.
Amid historically high wealth and income inequality, which has only worsened during the pandemic, day traders' use of Reddit to mobilize the masses, make quick fortunes, and take on Wall Street will likely bode well for the social media platform.

"The 'stonks' meme is surging in the internet economy amid the GameStop stock saga. Here's how it rose to notoriety.","https://www.businessinsider.com/stonks-meme-origin-stocks-dogecoin-gamestop-hold-line-memes-game-2021-1","Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","In the midst of an ongoing, whirlwind saga involving video games retailer GameStop, a Reddit forum known as r/WallStreetBets, and multiple hedge funds, one word has been on the tip of everyone's tongue: ""stonks.""
An intentional (and admittedly pretty funny) misspelling of the word ""stocks,"" stonks started as a meme in the latter half of the 2010s and has become a fixture online since. As Slate's Jordan Weissmann wrote, ""stonks"" has become a popular word in the discussion around internet-fueled boosting of the unlikely stocks such as GameStop. 
It's little surprise that the meme has become emblematic of the ongoing saga, which has been dominated by a David vs. Goliath narrative of Redditors banding together to skyrocket the value of GameStop stock at the expense of hedge funds who had bet on it falling. In the time since GameStop's stock began to meteorically rise, day traders have targeted other companies including AMC, Nokia, and Bed Bath & Beyond.
Read more: The 4 main reasons that GameStop stock became the target of a Reddit forum with more than 2 million members
While the meme has witnessed its biggest explosion yet in 2021, it's been around since 2017 and has circulated in financial meme circles (and broader internet culture) for years.
You can't talk about ""stonks"" without talking about why it's funny in the first place: it's a ridiculous way to say ""stocks."" Similar dramatized mispronunciations have been around in meme culture for ages. The funny pronunciation is part of (if not essentially the entire) joke, and it lends brevity to the concept of stocks, and money, in general. 
The actual, visual ""stonks"" meme features a face known as  ""Meme Man,"" a smooth, bald facsimile of a 3D human head that reportedly emerged on 4chan and spread online in the latter half of the 2010s. The stonks meme gussies Meme Man up in a suit, places him against a blue background of assorted percentages, arrows, and numbers, and juxtaposes him against the word ""stonks"" with an orange arrow vaguely pointing up. 
 
Know Your Meme reported that the meme began to circulate online after Facebook page Special meme fresh posted it on June 5, 2017. From there, it spread online, appearing on the subreddit r/Ooer in July 2017, and later spreading to other social media platforms as well. The meme has continued to circulate online in the years since.
""Stonks"" came to be associated with vague financial transactions, the grand machinations of our capital-driven society, and the people who pretend to know anything about how it all happens. As MEL Magazine reported in 2019, the joke of the entire meme is that anything related to money is ""stonks."" 
 
The meme had a resurgence in 2019, after Reddit user u/_renji posted a fake text exchange on r/GoodFakeTexts. ""Please don't do this, I seriously can't live without you, I didn't cheat on you,"" the texter pleads, before accidentally sending the stonks meme.
Other factors have kept stonks alive in the zeitgeist, from a 2019 Elon Musk tweet to a dramatic TikTok reading of u/_renji's text exchange in 2020. ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons"" also tied the meme to the in-game ""stalk"" market, which saw players buying turnips and attempting to sell them for higher prices later in the week.
Financial meme pages like @litquidity and @finance_god regularly invoke ""stonks"" memes, and in communities like WallStreetBets, which was launched in 2012 and has since become a hub of meme stock discussion, ""stonks"" is just part of the vernacular.

Read more: The history of WallStreetBets, the Reddit group that upended the stock market with a campaign to boost GameStop
The stonks spirit has only been fanned over the course of the pandemic, during which, as Vox reported, there's been an uptick in trading activity. Slate economics writer Jordan Weissmann wrote that, anecdotally, ""stonks"" has been ""seeping further into common parlance"" since the market tanked amid the pandemic, with personalities like Barstool founder Dave Portnoy championing its use online.
The fact that ""stonks"" is already deeply entrenched language both in r/WallStreetBets, which has borne the heaviest scrutiny as of late, as well as internet culture writ large, meant that people were indubitably going to use it to describe the current GameStop saga, which feels like one giant meme (albeit one with very real implications) and has been driven by a community in which many apply a ""YOLO""-style mentality to investing.
In addition to being directly applicable to the situation at hand, ""stonks"" perfectly captures the je ne sais quoi of the situation. No matter whether you're one of the traders involved in the short squeeze or someone merely trying to understand what the hell is going on from the sidelines, one thing is clear: the entire thing is very ""stonks.""

"GameStop hearing filled with heated exchanges, technical problems","https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-gamestop-stock-hearing-robinhood-reddit-citadel-what-happened-2021-2","Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","Just weeks after the GameStop stock bubble popped, the US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee held an hours-long hearing examining what happened.
Though that hearing featured a variety of chief executives, from Reddit CEO Steve Huffman to Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, and even featured one popular financial influencer, the main target of questioning was Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev.
With over 50 members of the House of Representatives participating, the lines of questioning varied wildly. Some representatives asked Tenev about Robinhood's choice to halt trading of GameStop and other such ""meme stocks"" on January 28, while others asked him about Alex Kearns, a 20-year-old Robinhood user who thought he had lost $730,000 on the app. Kearns died by suicide in June 2020. 
""I'm sorry to the family of Mr. Kearns for your loss,"" Tenev said.
Kearns repeatedly contacted Robinhood's help desk, but didn't receive a response before he died. During his allotted time, Rep. Sean Casten played Tenev the recording that users hear when they call Robinhood for help.
He also criticized Robinhood for the ""innate tension"" at the heart of its business model, which he said is split ""between democratizing finance, which is a noble calling, and being a conduit to feed fish to sharks."" 
Lawmakers primarily focused on Tenev due to the stock trading app's critical role in the explosion of GameStop's stock value: Between January 20 and January 26, GameStop's stock value leaped from just over $35 per share to north of $140 per share. By January 27, it hit new highs of over $325 per share — an over 8,000% increase from just a few months ago.
The next morning, Robinhood halted trades of the stock because it ran out of money to cover the upfront cost of its customers stock purchases. The company even had to dilute its own value in order to quickly raise capital — a $3.4 billion investment from several different firms was announced in early February.
Tenev repeatedly told lawmakers the same story he's told previously: Robinhood was forced to temporarily halt trading of GameStop and several other stocks because the National Securities Clearing Corporation demanded $3 billion to cover volatile trades.
And he refuted claims that the decision was driven by the hedge funds which had taken out short positions on GameStop stock, as did Melvin Capital Management CEO Gabe Plotkin who also joined the hearing.
Another notable criticism repeatedly leveled at Robinhood: Gamification. The app notoriously features audio and visual elements that cheer on user actions. ""We didn't encourage anyone to tap on anything,"" Tenev said in one such exchange. ""We wanted to give our customers delightful features so they know we're listening to them and we care about them.""
From the very beginning of the hearing, technical issues plagued the video conference. Hot mics were frequent, and a few major sound issues caused pauses.
As the hearing — which kicked off at noon — pushed on, exchanges between legislators and interviewees got more and more brief.  
Legislators frequently cut in mid-answer with ""I'll reclaim my time"" in an effort to squeeze another question in. And an exchange between Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Citadel CEO Ken Griffin just after the five-hour mark got particularly contentious, as he attempted to talk over her. ""Let me finish my answer. I think it's important,"" he said. ""No, no,"" Tlaib responded. 
The few exchanges with Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill, a stock trader who made a name for himself as a YouTuber, were largely focused on what he specializes in: stock advice. Gill said he would still buy GameStop stock at its current value, and that he initially bought in months ago because it was ""undervalued."" Also of note: Gill's opening statement included at least one notable meme reference.
Ultimately, there were no huge revelations about the GameStop stock bubble or the major players involved in it from Thursday's hearing. It's the first of several such hearings that the financial services committee plans in the wake of the bubble's popping.

"'Game of Thrones' Kit Harington and Rose Leslie Relationship Timeline","https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-kit-harington-rose-leslie-jon-snow-ygritte-dating-timeline-2017-7","Tue, 16 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" may not be known for its happy endings, but so far costars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie are living the sweetest fairy-tale worthy love story.
The actors played on-screen couple Jon Snow and Ygritte for three seasons, but they have a real-life romance as well. Harington and Leslie got married on June 23, 2018, after dating for several years. In February 2021, the couple reportedly welcomed their first baby to the world. 
Here's the complete timeline of their non-fictional love story.
On season two, Jon Snow ventures beyond the Wall and meets Ygritte, a member a group called the Free Folk. He eventually lives among them as a spy for the Night's Watch, but he falls in love with Ygritte along the way.
They were spotted on a date in a restaurant and the ""Game of Thrones"" fandom basically exploded.
This was the season when Ygritte and Jon Snow became romantically involved. Years later, Harington would admit that he fell in love with Leslie during the months they spent filming in Iceland.
While promoting the third season of ""Game of Thrones,"" Harington told Simone Boyce of Winter is Coming that his on-screen chemistry with Leslie was mostly due to their real friendship.
""We really get on as friends and we hit it off very quickly when we first met and I think that reflects on screen, because we've got a good dialogue going on off screen,"" Harington said.
""Rose and Kit are no longer together,"" The Stir reported. ""Rose has a new boyfriend who is not in the public eye. She is eager to keep this relationship out of the spotlight.""
In an interview with The Standard, Harington spoke publicly about the rumors for the first time. ""Me and Rose [Leslie] are very, very close and very good friends,"" Harington said. ""And continue to be, actually. She's wonderful. But no, no love affair.""
But Harington also cryptically admitted that he's very private:
""On a serious level, I wouldn't tell the press if I was in a relationship or not. I wouldn't ever reveal that, because it takes you down a certain road… I have no desire to be courting the press with my love life. It's not my job, it's not who I am — and I actually think it's more fun for everyone to speculate. The minute I start telling people things are true or not true, then it's just boring.""
This was the end of their on-screen romance, but not their real-life love story.
As PopSugar reported, Harington and Leslie were seen in the Los Angeles International Airport together ahead of the ""Game of Thrones"" panel at Comic-Con. 
""They've been back on for about three months,"" a source told Us. ""That said, it's casual right now and they're having fun. They're not moving in together or anything like that yet.""
This would mean that they rekindled their romance in May 2014.
Less than a year after the Us Magazine report, Harington told GQ that he was single. Here's the section of the interview written told from reporter Tom Lamont's point of view: 
Harington tells me: ""I'll never talk about any particular relationship I've been in. But I will say I'm single at the moment.""
I'm about to move on when he continues: ""Relationships as an actor are incredibly difficult. With someone who's not an actor, because they never get to see you; and with someone who is an actor, because you're ships in the night a lot of the time. I mean, ideally, if you keep acting in the film world, you're a traveling salesman. And your options are: sacrifice a lot of your career to make sure it's not unfair on the other person, or find someone who is willing to be your travelling circus. That's where I stand, and I'm trying to address it at the moment.""


A post shared by Will Keuper (@thekirbyn)Aug 25, 2015 at 7:37am PDT

Celebrity news site Lainey Gossip reported this tidbit: ""According to the person who took the photo (who, evidently, was practically piggy-backing Jon Snow on the escalator), they were also holding hands.""
ET reporter Nancy O'Dell got the scoop from Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen).
When asked about the kissing on the SAG Awards red carpet, Clarke said: ""My goodness! You know, we like to spread the love on our show. It's a beautiful thing. She's one of my best friends, so it's good.""
The 2016 Olivier Awards was the first event at which Harington and Leslie were clearly attending as boyfriend and girlfriend. 
When asked by Vogue Italia what his favorite memory of filming ""Game of Thrones"" was, Harington recalled the time spent in Iceland for season three.
""Because the country is beautiful, because the Northern Lights are magical, and because it was there that I fell in love,"" he said. ""If you're already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it's becomes very easy to fall in love.""
Since both actors had been busy with their own projects, Leslie said FaceTime was the key to communicating via long distance. This was one of the first times she spoke about their relationship with reporters.
In an interview with Esquire, Harington confirmed their real-life love and plans for living together. 
When he declined to elaborate on their love story, Harington told Esquire it was because ""it's as much her relationship as it is mine and I can't speak for both of us. But yeah, we are very, very happy. So that's what I'll say about that.""
 
After gossip sites begin reporting that Harington had proposed to Leslie, a spokesperson denied the rumor, saying ""they are not engaged."" 
On September 26, new reports sprang up saying Harington had proposed to Leslie after they moved into a new house together. People Magazine reported the news citing an anonymous source, along with The Sun.
""They're yet to set a date, but told friends and family last week that they've got engaged,"" a source told The Sun.
 
The official announcement was made the old fashioned way — in the newspaper:
Mr KC [Kit Catesby] Harington and Miss RE [Rose Eleanor] Leslie
The engagement is announced between Kit, younger son of David and Deborah Harington of Worcestershire, and Rose, middle daughter of Sebastian and Candy Leslie of Aberdeenshire.
For more photos from the big day, read Insider's report on the true royal wedding ""Game of Thrones"" fans had been waiting for.
 
""I have no idea if we will, but say me and Rose do have children. They'll know. They'll be able to see the genesis of their parents getting together. Which is quite a wonderful thought, really,"" he said. 
Leslie showed off her growing belly in the magazine's summer 2020 issue, which was published in late September.
 
According to E! News, Leslie gave birth over Valentine's Day weekend, and the couple was spotted outside with the newborn on Tuesday, February 16.
A representative for Harington confirmed to E! ""that the couple welcomed a baby boy"" and said they are ""very very happy!""
Insider reached out to reps for Harington and Leslie but did not immediately hear back.

"Giuliani says 'trial by combat' remark was 'Game of Thrones' reference","https://www.businessinsider.com/giuliani-claims-trial-by-combat-comment-game-of-thrones-reference-2021-1","Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","Nearly a week after calling for ""trial by combat"" at the Washington, DC, rally that directly preceded the riot at the US Capitol, Rudy Giuliani says he was just making a ""Game of Thrones"" reference and not calling for a violent battle.
Giuliani, the personal attorney of President Donald Trump, was among several people including Trump and Donald Trump Jr. who spoke in front of hundreds of protesters outside the White House on the afternoon of January 6 as part of the ""Save America"" rally.
Trump overtly encouraged attendees at the rally to march to the Capitol, which many of them did in what turned into a deadly riot. At least five people, including a police officer, died in connection to the insurrection.
At the rally, Giuliani repeated baseless claims about election fraud and told the audience: ""If we are wrong, we will be made fools of, but if we're right, a lot of them will go to jail. So let's have trial by combat.""
Speaking with The Hill on Tuesday, Giuliani told the reporter Brett Samuels that he was just making a ""Game of Thrones"" reference.
""I was referencing the kind of trial that took place for Tyrion in that very famous documentary about fictitious medieval England,"" Giuliani told Samuels. ""When Tyrion, who is a very small man, is accused of murder. He didn't commit murder, he can't defend himself, and he hires a champion to defend him.""
It's unclear who Giuliani is referring to as the Tyrion in this story.
Giuliani went on to say he was actually referring to a ""trial between machines,"" an allusion to the legal battles Trump had waged against Dominion Voting Systems. The president, along with Giuliani and the lawyer Sidney Powell, has often baselessly claimed that the voting machines were rigged against him.
""I'm talking about trial between machines,"" he continued. ""In fact, you'll see it comes up exactly in the context of I challenge them to allow us to examine their machines. And then I say the consequences of the trial by combat will be if they prove that we're wrong, we'll be exceedingly embraced — we'll be disgraced. If we prove that they're wrong, they go to jail.""
Giuliani went on to say his trial-by-combat comment was not a call to violence.
""It incited no violent response from the crowd,"" he told Samuels. ""None. The crowd didn't jump up saying, 'Lock him up, throw him to jail, go to hell.' I've had speeches where people jump up and say, 'lock him up.' It was not an emotional — it was not an emotion-inspiring part of the speech.""
Just an hour after Giuliani spoke, and Trump encouraged the crowd to ""walk down to the Capitol"" to ""cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them,"" a mob of the president's supporters forced their way into the Capitol, where Congress was in session.
""You'll never take back our country with weakness,"" Trump told the crowd. ""You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.""

During his interview with The Hill, Giuliani repeated claims that the election was fraudulent and said the president bore ""no responsibility"" for the Capitol insurrection. He also baselessly claimed the Capitol breach was led by leftists impersonating Trump supporters and criticized House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy for saying otherwise.
Axios had reported earlier that McCarthy told Trump during a heated call on Monday that the mob consisted not of antifa but of ""MAGA"" supporters, a reference to Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. ""I know,"" he continued, ""I was there.""
""Kevin McCarthy doesn't know what the hell he's talking about,"" Giuliani told The Hill. ""He doesn't investigate. He's part of the Washington establishment. They make up the truth and they repeat it to each other. You think they ever bother to investigate?""
Emails to both Giuliani and McCarthy were not immediately returned.
Though Giuliani argues his statements weren't meant to rile the mob, several institutions have distanced themselves from him in recent days.
The New York State Bar Association has opened up an inquiry into whether Giuliani should be disbarred. The bylaws of the association say ""no person who advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States, or of any state, territory or possession thereof, or of any political subdivision therein, by force or other illegal means, shall be a member of the Association.""
Several members of Congress, including Reps. Mondaire Jones and Ted Lieu, sent a letter to the association urging it to disbar the former New York City mayor.
On Wednesday, Middlebury College announced it was revoking Giuliani's honorary degree over what it described as his role in ""fomenting the violent uprising against our nation's Capitol.""

"How short-selling works, and why it didn't work on GameStop","https://www.businessinsider.com/how-short-selling-works-why-it-didnt-work-on-gamestop-2021-1","Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","GameStop short-sellers have taken a hit this year as the stock has risen to unprecedented levels, in what analysts have dubbed an irrational rally stoked by the Reddit group ""Wall Street Bets."" 
Investors always have the option to short a company's stock. In the case of GameStop, Melvin Capital and Citron Research were among the list of short sellers, and they lost their bet, by a lot. Members of the subReddit group, which has more than 6 million users, have been bidding up GameStop shares in the three months, causing the stock to skyrocket above $300 in mid-January, to now around $200. 
And short sellers have lost billions. 
To short a stock means the investor is betting the price of that company's shares will decline. (In a normal bet, which is called going long, investors purchase a stock with the hopes of it increasing).
In shorting a stock, an investor borrows shares from a lender, let's say at $10 per share. The investor then takes the borrowed shares and sells them for that same price. Once the stock goes down, to let's say $1 per share, the investor buys the shares back and returns them to the lender, pocketing $9 per share. 
""Let's say you short XYZ company at $100, and the next day it goes to $10. You take $10 out of your pocket and buy back the stock and give it to the guy you borrowed it from. And you have $90 in your pocket,"" Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush, told Insider. Pachter added that there's the added cost of paying the interest on borrowing the stock, though if an investor only holds a short position for a month, the interest would be negligible. 
But sometimes, like in the case of GameStop, the shorts get ""squeezed"" when the shares go up, said Telsey analyst Joe Feldman, who rates the shares sell with a $30 target price. The buyers of the stock send the price up forcing the shorts to close their positions and become buyers, sending the price even higher. So if the shares were borrowed when the stock was $10, and now the stock is $20, the investor loses $10 per share.

GameStop short-sellers Melvin Capital and Citron Research lost a lot when the stock started spiking, said Pachter. They've both since closed out of their short positions. CNBC reported that hedge fund Melvin Capital ate a huge loss in January when it closed its short position. Citron managing partner Andrew Left said that the firm's position was covered when GameStop traded at about $90 at ""a loss of 100%.""
""There's a point where the shorts say, 'This is crazy I'm getting out,'"" Pachter said. Even GameStop executives have acknowledge the stock is ""extremely volatile,"" but said it's out of their control.
The problem with shorting the stock at the higher price now, betting it will go back to normal levels, is that analysts are unsure where the irrational share increase will stop. ""What if it goes to infinity?"" Pachter said. According to MarketBeat data, GameStop's short interest rate is still high at 18.7%, though lower than before. 
Joost van Dreunen, who teaches at the New York University Stern School of Business and has an expertise in gaming, said the GameStop valuation is ""totally disconnected from reality."" GameStop's record highs prior to this rally were in 2007 and 2013 when the Nintendo Wii and Switch launched, respectively, and pushed the stock to about $60. 
""That was their absolute high watermark, and they haven't been able to recover it since,"" van Dreunen said. ""The current situation is just post-modern financial drama totally void of reality.""
""Fundamentally, nothing has changed for the company,"" Feldman said.

"Tamzin Merchant reveals why she wanted to 'back out' of playing Daenerys Targaryen in 'Game of Thrones'","https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-why-daenerys-was-recast-tamzin-merchant-2021-1","Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","The original ""Game of Thrones"" pilot has never been seen by the public and to this day fans still have many questions about what went wrong with HBO's first attempt. Among those mysteries was the reason why Tamzin Merchant was replaced with Emilia Clarke for the now-iconic role of Daenerys Targaryen. 
After a decade of silence on the matter, Merchant has revealed a piece of the puzzle in a new interview with Entertainment Weekly's James Hibberd.
""I didn't have any training as an actor. I only have my instincts,"" Merchant said. ""And what excites me and what drives me is a compelling story and a compelling character. So for me, 'Game of Thrones' was never that.""

Though Merchant doesn't specify whether she was ultimately the one who asked to be removed from the show, or if that was a decision from HBO's creative team, the actress says she did try to ""back out"" of the contract before she filmed any scenes.
""I tried to back out of that situation and, during the contract process, I did back out,"" Merchant said. ""I was talked back into it by some persuasive people. Then I found myself naked and afraid in Morocco and riding a horse that was clearly much more excited to be there than I was.""

The ""excited"" horse she's referring to was the steed Daenerys is gifted by her husband, Khal Drogo, on their wedding night. As revealed in Hibberd's oral history of ""Game of Thrones,"" the horse had a visible erection during the filming of the pivotal sexual assault scene. 
Merchant expressed no regrets over her departure from the role, even given how popular the show became in its eight-year run. 

                          
                        ""I think it's a testament to Emilia Clarke for making that role iconic – she was obviously excited to tell that story, and she was epic and excellent,"" Merchant told EW. ""But for me, it wasn't in my heart to tell it.""
Merchant isn't the only person who left ""Game of Thrones"" before the pilot was refilmed and made into the episode fans have now come to know and love. For the first version of the pilot, Benioff and Weiss had hired director Tom McCarthy. 
McCarthy said he had ""very little"" impact on the look and feel of the pilot, and by the time Benioff and Weiss realized they needed to reshoot the bulk of it, McCarthy was busy with another project and unable to return for another run.

                        ""I couldn't do it. And I just didn't feel connected to it,"" McCarthy said in a 2011 interview with AV Club. ""It wasn't a big decision. It felt right.""
Timothy Van Patten took over for reshoots of the pilot and also directed the second episode of the debut season.
Then actress Michelle Fairley was recast into the role of Catelyn Stark. She took over for Jennifer Ehle, who had decided to leave the project after reconsidering the lengthy time commitment.

"Mark Cuban thanks WallStreetBets for 'changing the game'","https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-cuban-thanks-wallstreetbets-advises-hold-gamestop-stock-robinhood-reddit-2021-2","Tue, 02 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","In a Reddit AMA on Tuesday morning, billionaire investor Mark Cuban expressed gratitude to the members of the WallStreetBets Reddit forum.
""Thanks for changing the game,"" he said. ""Thanks for taking on Wall Street."" In the past week, amateur traders on WallStreetBets have driven up the value of several stocks, including GameStop and AMC Theaters, that some hedge funds bet heavily against. The resulting short-squeeze caused trading restrictions on the popular trading app Robinhood and uproar on social media. The ongoing saga also sent shockwaves across the industry and drew scrutiny from lawmakers.
Though Cuban said that he does not own GameStop shares, his advice to those who do is to hold onto their shares if they can. 
""If you can afford to hold the stock, you hold,"" he said. ""I don't own it, but that's what I would do. Why ? Because when RH and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers, then we will see what WSB is really made of. That is when you get to make it all work.""
He also predicted in the AMA that Wall Street Bets would be able to replicate this trading pattern in the future. His advice was to change brokers, saying that Robinhood did not have sufficient capital to ""fund the fight.""
""When you load back up,"" he continued, ""[find] a broker with TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS in assets on their balance sheet.""
GameStop stock has seen a sharp drop in value this week, and Cuban's comments come against a backdrop of market uncertainty.
Robinhood temporarily froze trading of GameStop and other highly valued stocks last week in order to meet federal clearing house and capital requirements. The app has raised $3.4 billion since last week, but trading restrictions are still in effect, although they have been slowly loosened on GameStop.
Several class-action suits have already been filed against Robinhood. Cuban, when asked about the odds of success of the suits, was not particularly optimistic about their ability to make change. 
""You will win,"" he told one user of potential suits. ""And after legal fee[s] you will get your $4.00 settlement check.""This AMA isn't the first time Cuban has commented on the ongoing market volatility fueled in part by Reddit. In a blog post on Sunday, the investor wrote that ""Wall Street and the agency that governs it, the SEC, have become fat and happy. Fat and Happy makes [the] old school slow and resistant to change.""
He also expressed his support in a tweet last week.
Cuban told CNBC on Tuesday of WallStreetBets traders that, ""I think now that they've recognized their power and now that they've learned some lessons, we're going to get more of it, not less of it.""
