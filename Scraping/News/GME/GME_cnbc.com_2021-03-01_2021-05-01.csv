Taiwan's outsized role in chipmaking has come under the spotlight as a global shortage of semiconductors forced several automakers to halt production.
Countries including the U.S. and Germany reached out to Taiwan to help alleviate bottlenecks in the production of chips. The shortage was a result of increased demand for electronics during the Covid-19 pandemic, and was exacerbated by former President Donald Trump's trade war with China.
Taiwan dominates the foundry market, or the outsourcing of semiconductor manufacturing. Its contract manufacturers together accounted for more than 60% of total global foundry revenue last year, according to data by Taipei-based research firm TrendForce.
Much of Taiwan's dominance can be attributed to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co or TSMC, the world's largest foundry that counts major technology firms such as Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia as its clients. TSMC accounted for 54% of total foundry revenue globally last year, TrendForce data showed.
Semiconductors are critical components that power electronics from computers and smartphones to the brake sensors in cars. The production of chips involves a complex network of firms that design or make them, as well as those that supply the technology, materials and machinery to do so.  
TSMC focuses solely on manufacturing and has been the go-to producer for many cutting-edge semiconductors, Dan Wang, a technology analyst at research firm Gavekal, said in a podcast by Singapore's DBS bank.  
""So TSMC, if you just have a look at market share, I believe manufactures around 50% of all semiconductors in the world. And I think that still understates how important it is, because these are some of the most advanced chips out there,"" said Wang.
Semiconductor designers and manufacturers are on a quest to make chips smaller and better. Currently, TSMC and its South Korean rival Samsung are the only foundries capable of manufacturing the most advanced 5-nanometer chips.
TSMC is already gearing up for the next-generation 3-nanometer chips, that will reportedly start production in 2022.
Some countries are planning to boost their own semiconductor production — and one of them is China, which is aiming to be more self-reliant.
But China's tech fight with the previous U.S. administration is holding back its largest chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, or SMIC, said Paul Triolo, geo-technology practice head at risk consultancy Eurasia Group.
Last year, the Trump administration placed SMIC on a blacklist known as the entity list, which limits the company's access to technology and machinery that it needs.
SMIC was the fifth largest semiconductor foundry globally by revenue in 2020 — behind Taiwan's TSMC and UMC, South Korea's Samsung, and GlobalFoundries in the U.S., TrendForce data showed.
""The target right now is being able to compete at the cutting edge with companies like TSMC, Samsung and Intel,"" Triolo told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia.""
""The problem that SMIC is in now, the dilemma, is the U.S. government has put them on the entity list,"" he said. ""But the bigger picture is that SMIC has been cut off, at least for the moment, from acquiring the really cutting-edge equipment it needs from ASML, which is a Dutch company.""
ASML makes the so-called extreme ultraviolet lithography equipment that's used to produce the most advanced chips such as those manufactured by TSMC and Samsung. Reuters reported last year that the Trump administration pressured the Netherlands government to stop the sale of the machine to SMIC.
Even if SMIC has access to ASML's equipment, the company would take years to start producing high-end chips in large quantities, said Triolo.
Until then, it appears that TSMC would maintain its leading position.
""TSMC is just so dominant. It no longer really has much competition at all on the high end. And so, it took a while for this model really to work out. But at this point, it can be a very profitable company indeed,"" said Wang of Gavekal.

Keith Gill, the Reddit trading crowd's favorite and the man who inspired the epic GameStop short squeeze, just doubled down on his bet on the video game retailer, forgoing millions of dollars in quick profit to ramp up his stake.
The investor, who goes by DeepF------Value on Reddit and Roaring Kitty on YouTube, exercised his 500 GameStop call options contracts as they expired on Friday, giving him 50,000 more shares at a strike price of just $12. If he had sold the options at Friday's price, he could have made more than $7 million on the bet.
On top of exercising these options contracts, Gill bought 50,000 more GameStop shares, bringing his total investment to 200,000 shares worth more than $30 million.
While he gave up the quick payday on this options trade, his long investment is now even more wildly profitable with his average cost at $55.17, according to Gill's latest update on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets forum Friday. GameStop closed Friday at $154.69, giving him a profit of nearly $20 million. (The post was not independently verified by CNBC so we are assuming that it is his actual account.)
Gill attracted an army of day traders who piled into the brick-and-mortar video game stock and call options, pushing the shares up 400% in a single week in January. GameStop is up 720% for the year.
The shares ticked slightly higher in after hours trading with some investors perhaps heartened that Gill exercised his call options to get even more long.
The investor was a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. Through YouTube videos and Reddit posts, Gill encouraged a band of retail traders to squeeze out short selling hedge funds in GameStop.
The action got so wild at one point that brokerages including Robinhood had to restrict trading in the stock as it blew up their clearinghouse margin. The mania also led to a series of congressional hearings, featuring Gill, around brokers' practices and gamifying retail trading.
Gill owned 10,000 shares of GameStop at the end of 2020 and increased his holding to 50,000 shares in January and to 100,000 in mid-February. Judging from the updates he posted on Reddit, he never sold his GameStop stakes amid the monstrous short squeeze or in the aftermath.
The GameStop story is still far from over. Besides the scrutiny the saga brought on around retail trading, the company itself is in the middle of a transformation, hoping to capitalize on the massive rally in the stock price.
GameStop announced a $1 billion stock sale at the beginning of April to accelerate its e-commerce transition led by activist investor and board member Ryan Cohen, who is Chewy's co-founder. The company also hired former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

The GameStop story added another wild chapter on Wednesday as the retailer's stock popped 40% before quickly falling back to earth. The move appeared to be on no new headlines.
The stock rose as high as $348.50 per share on Wednesday, topping its record closing high from Jan. 27. The shares were then paused for volatility by the exchange. However, the shares lost all of those gains in a rapid decline around 12:30 p.m. ET.
The shares were halted down 12% at just under $200 per share. The stock bounced around after trading resumed and closed up 7.3%.
The stock, which rose dramatically in January as retail traders bid up the stock to create a short squeeze, was given a boost recently when the company announced that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen would lead a committee to help GameStop transition to e-commerce.
GameStop was the headliner of a group of heavily shorted stocks that were targeted by retail traders on Reddit earlier this year. Short selling is a strategy in which investors borrow shares of a stock at a certain price on hopes that the market value will fall below that level. If the shares rise instead, the short sellers are forced to buy the stocks and cover their positions, creating a feedback loop known as a short squeeze.
The January surge above $300 per share for GameStop forced brokerages including Robinhood to limit trading in heavily shorted stocks, and the momentum reversed in February. The volatility has spawned a series of Congressional hearings involving Reddit and YouTube trader Keith Gill.
GameStop has remained a regular conversation on Reddit in recent weeks, with a post on Wednesday reading, ""Hold GME to the moon. We're coming for $300 today.""
The original short squeeze for GameStop hit several hedge funds hard, and appeared to unnerve the broader markets. Some professional investors have pointed to GameStop's volatile trading as emblematic of frothiness in parts of the market.
""I really am concerned that there's too much promotion, there's too much speculation, there's too much trading stocks as lottery tickets for companies that are far from proven,"" Brad Gerstner, founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital, said Wednesday CNBC's ""Halftime Report."" ""That's never the way we try to make money. Just stay out of the way. We don't trade very much. We buy and hold for the long term.""
 A GameStop spokesperson wasn't immediately available for comment.

LONDON — Fortnite developer Epic Games has acquired Tonic Games Group, the British studio behind smash hit video game Fall Guys.
Fall Guys became an instant hit when it launched last summer, attracting millions of players within a month of its release. The game sees up to 60 people play as jelly beans which compete to make it through a series of candy-colored obstacle courses to win crowns, in-game currency which players then use to buy cosmetic items.
It was helped in large part by a wave of demand for video games during the coronavirus pandemic. The deal with Epic comes amid a slew of acquisitions in the gaming industry. Last year, Microsoft agreed to buy iconic games group Bethesda for $7.5 billion, while EA recently closed its $1.2 billion takeover of British racing games maker Codemasters.
""It's no secret that Epic is invested in building the metaverse and Tonic Games shares this goal,"" said Tim Sweeney, Epic's founder and CEO in a statement. ""As Epic works to build this virtual future, we need great creative talent who know how to build powerful games, content and experiences.""
Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Fortnite and Fall Guys are similar in the sense that both fall within the popular battle royale genre, which was itself made popular to begin with by the massive success of Fortnite. Since its 2017 release, Fortnite has amassed more than 350 million players. That's attracted the attention of notable investors like Sony, which invested $250 million into Epic last year. The firm was last valued at $17.3 billion.
At the same time, Epic has been locked in a tense legal fight with Apple over the iPhone maker's app store policies. Epic last year published a version of Fortnite to the Apple App Store that included a method for users to make in-app purchases without giving Apple its usual 30% cut. Apple subsequently delisted the Fortnite app and Epic sued Apple later in the day.

GameStop's stock price climbed on Tuesday after the video game retailer said it sold 3.5 million additional shares, raising $551 million to speed up the company's e-commerce transformation.
The stock, favored by the Reddit retail trading crowd, jumped more than 5% on Tuesday after gaining nearly 12% during Monday's regular trading hours. Shares are up nearly 850% this year.
GameStop announced the ""at-the-market"" stock offering at the beginning of April, which was viewed as a way to capitalize on its recent head-turning rally that made Wall Street history.
In late January, a band of Reddit-obsessed retail traders coordinated trades on heavily shorted stocks, created a massive short squeeze in GameStop, whose shares surged 400% at one point. The brick-and-mortar retailer traded at less than $20 a share at the start of 2021.
The company is now in the middle of a shift to e-commerce, spearheaded by activist investor and board member Ryan Cohen, who was Chewy's co-founder. 
Last week, GameStop announced its CEO George Sherman will step down by July 31. It said the board is leading a search to identify CEO candidates who can accelerate the next phase of the company's transformation.
The company also hired former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

Major League Baseball commissioner Robert Manfred announced Friday that the 2021 All-Star Game will no longer be held in Atlanta.
The decision follows an election bill signed on Wednesday by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, which opponents say disproportionately disenfranchises people of color. It's one of the first tangible responses to the law, which was denounced by business executives across the United States earlier this week.
Restaurants, hotels, rental car agencies and other businesses make money when these big events come to town. The MLB All-Star game generated about $49 million for the local economy when it was hosted in Atlanta in 2000, according to Baseball Almanac. The 2019 All-Star Game was projected to bring in $65 million for Cleveland, according to the same site.
""Over the last week, we have engaged in thoughtful conversations with Clubs, former and current players, the Players Association, and The Players Alliance, among others, to listen to their views,"" Manfred said. ""I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year's All-Star Game and MLB Draft.""
Georgia's new law adds guidelines around mail-in ballots, voter registration and provides state officials more authority around how elections are operated. Critics say the law will suppress votes, especially among people of color in underserved areas.
""Just as elections have consequences, so do the actions of those who are elected,"" Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said on Twitter of MLB's decision. ""Unfortunately, the removal of the @MLB All Star game from GA is likely the 1st of many dominoes to fall, until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed.""
""Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,"" Manfred said. ""In 2020, MLB became the first professional sports league to join the non-partisan Civic Alliance to help build a future in which everyone participates in shaping the United States. We proudly used our platform to encourage baseball fans and communities throughout our country to perform their civic duty and actively participate in the voting process. Fair access to voting continues to have our game's unwavering support.""
Manfred said MLB will honor commitments to support local communities in Atlanta. The league is still finalizing a new host city and ""details about these events will be announced shortly,"" he said.
""Today, Major League Baseball caved to fear, political opportunism, and liberal lies,"" said Georgia Gov. Kemp said in response. ""Georgians - and all Americans - should fully understand what the MLB's knee-jerk decision means: cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included. If the left doesn't agree with you, facts and the truth do not matter.""
""This attack on our state is the direct result of repeated lies from Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams about a bill that expands access to the ballot box and ensures the integrity of our elections,"" Kemp added. ""I will not back down. Georgians will not be bullied. We will continue to stand up for secure, accessible, fair elections. Earlier today, I spoke with the leadership of the Atlanta Braves who informed me they do not support the MLB's decision.""
The Atlanta Braves baseball team said on Twitter it is ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision.
""This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city. The Braves organization will continue to stress the importance of equal voting opportunities and we had hoped our city could use this event as a platform to enhance the discussion. Our city has always been known as a uniter in divided times and we will miss the opportunity to address issues that are important to our community. Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision.""
CNBC's Jabari Young contributed to this report.
Correction: This story was updated to remove a reference to the 2020 All-Star game in Los Angeles, which was canceled.

The GameStop frenzy in late January forced Wall Street to pay attention to retail investors like never before.
The r/WallStreetBets community piled into the video game retailer's stock and options, triggering a short squeeze and leaving short sellers with huge losses.
In the aftermath, Wall Street and news outlets dove deep into subreddit to understand how this happened. WallStreetBets' unique mix of self-deprecating, camaraderie and tongue-in-cheek humor captured and identified with the American public.
""In the way they define themselves, they are setting up 'this is who we are' and that can bring people in,"" College of Charleston communication professor Ryan Milner said. ""There really is a power in the collectivism happening on WallStreetBets.""
Here's an explainer on why these collective actions are becoming more common, the role memes play in these situations and what's next for retail investing.

Epic Games, developer of the popular video game Fortnite, on Tuesday said it raised $1 billion in a new round of funding that lifts the company's valuation to $28.7 billion.
The Cary, North Carolina-based firm said that $200 million of the fresh cash raised came from Sony, which had initially invested in the company last year. Other investors in the round included Appaloosa, Baillie Gifford and Fidelity. Epic's latest market value represents a 66% increase from what it was worth in a $1.8 billion deal last year.
""We are grateful to our new and existing investors who support our vision for Epic and the Metaverse,"" said Tim Sweeney, CEO and founder of Epic Games.
""Their investment will help accelerate our work around building connected social experiences in Fortnite, Rocket League and Fall Guys, while empowering game developers and creators with Unreal Engine, Epic Online Services and the Epic Games Store."" 
Sweeney remains the controlling shareholder of the company, Epic said. Credit Suisse and BofA Securities acted as joint placements to Epic in its latest financing round, Epic said, while Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati provided legal counsel.
Epic is a major player in the video games industry. Its battle royale title Fortnite quickly became a hit when it released in 2017 and is now a cultural phenomenon, with millions of people watching others playing the game on streaming platforms and celebrities and influencers promoting it online.
But Epic is known for more than just Fortnite. The company's Unreal game engine software powers many of the world's top games. It also played a role in the film industry's shift to virtual production during the coronavirus pandemic.
Epic is betting big on the so-called ""metaverse,"" an informal term used to describe a collaborative and immersive virtual world. Fortnite has hosted massive virtual concerts with artists like Travis Scott and Marshmello, for example. Other companies, including Microsoft and Roblox, are also investing heavily in this trend.
And Epic has been expanding into other areas, including PC games distribution with its Epic Games Store — a rival to Valve's Steam — as well as new content. Last month, Epic announced it had bought Mediatonic, the British studio behind Fall Guys. That game became an instant hit when it launched last summer, attracting millions of players stuck at home due to Covid restrictions.
Over the last year, however, Epic has mainly drawn headlines due to its legal battle with Apple over the latter's app store policies. Epic tried to avoid Apple's 30% App Store fee through a software update that effectively bypassed the Cupertino, California-based company's own payments system. Apple responded by removing Fortnite from its App Store.
Last week, the two companies laid out in separate filings what they consider to be the key facts and main legal issues ahead of a highly-anticipated antitrust trial that's slated to start next month.

GameStop rallied Monday after the video game retailer announced its CEO succession plan as it tries to pivot to e-commerce following a historic short squeeze.
Shares of GameStop jumped more than 6% to close at $164.37.
The company said CEO George Sherman will step down by July 31. It said the board is leading a search to identify CEO candidates who can accelerate the next phase of the company's transformation.
While GameStop shares are well below the record highs of $483 reached in January, the stock is still up a whopping 770% for 2021. To take advantage of the massive Reddit-fueled rally, GameStop announced a $1 billion stock sale earlier this month. It plans to use the sale's proceeds to aid its transition into e-commerce, which is led by activist investor and Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen.
The company also hired former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.
""GameStop's next CEO and CFO are likely to come from the tech industry, as with the other recent senior hires, and would require a wide range of strategic and operational experience, given GameStop's complex business model, including ~4,800 global stores, digital, used games, new software and hardware, and collectibles,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman wrote in a note.
Some investors also took comfort in Keith Gill doubling down on his GameStop bet. On Friday, he decided to forgo millions of dollars in quick profit from an options trade. Gill is perhaps the biggest influencer in the Reddit retail trading crowd.
The investor — who goes by DeepF------Value on Reddit and Roaring Kitty on YouTube — exercised his 500 GameStop call options contracts as they expired on Friday, giving him 50,000 more shares at a strike price of just $12. Gill could could have made more than $7 million on the bet if he had sold the options at Friday's price.
Gill also bought 50,000 more GameStop shares, bringing his total investment to 200,000 shares worth more than $30 million.
Gill's trading information is based on his Reddit posts, which appear to be snapshots of his investment account. The posts were not independently verified by CNBC.
Still, Wall Street analysts' consensus is that GameStop's stock price is significantly detached from fundamentals. Tesley maintained its underperform rating and 12-month price target of just $30 per share.
""We continue to believe the current valuation far exceeds our rosy fundamental expectations and projected multi-year benefits from the strategic transformation,"" Feldman said.

Major League Baseball will hold its 2021 All-Star Game at Coors Field in Denver, the league said on Tuesday.
MLB announced the venue change just days after pulling the game out of Atlanta due to a controversial voting law passed by state officials in Georgia. MLB opposed the law, which critics suggest is aimed at suppressing votes among people of color in underserved areas.
MLB selected Denver because officials in the city had previously presented a plan to host the game at a future date. The last time Denver hosted baseball's midsummer classic was in 1998. According to Baseball Almanac, that event generated over $40 million for the area.
The game is scheduled for July 13.
""Major League Baseball is grateful to the Rockies, the City of Denver and the State of Colorado for their support of this summer's All-Star Game,"" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. ""We appreciate their flexibility and enthusiasm to deliver a first-class event for our game and the region. We look forward to celebrating our sport's best players and entertaining fans around the world.""
MLB has faced backlash from politicians for moving the game and also faced opposition from the Braves, which is owned by Liberty Media Corp. An official from Cobb Travel and Tourism in Georgia told CNN the state could suffer an economic loss of over $100 million due to the relocation.
""The 8,000-plus MLB contracted hotel room nights that will not actualize as a result of the MLB All-Star Game relocation will have a negative impact on Cobb's hospitality industry and other local businesses, further delaying recovery,"" said Holly Quinlan, the CEO of the firm, according to the network.
The 2019 All-Star contest was estimated to have generated more than $60 million for Cleveland, and the 2020 event, which was canceled due to the Covid pandemic, had been projected to bring in roughly $89 million for Los Angeles. Dodgers Stadium in Los Angeles will host the 2022 All-Star Game instead.
