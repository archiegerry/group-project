            Westeros could be coming to the West End. 
    

            A stage show set in the world of “Game of Thrones” is in the works, according to The Hollywood Reporter.
    

            Author George R.R. Martin told the publication he is developing a live stage show for Broadway, West End and Australia to hopefully debut in 2023.

            The publication said characters Ned Stark and Jaime Lannister, played by Sean Bean and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in the HBO television series, could appear in the stage version, based on hints given about when the play is set. 
    

            A description shared by the magazine teased that the show will feature “many of the most iconic and well-known characters from the series.” 
    

            Producers on the project reportedly include Simon Painter, Tim Lawson and Jonathan Sanford. 
    

            Martin’s representatives did not immediately return a request for further comment.  “Game of Thrones” concluded its eight-season run on HBO in 2019. HBO, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia.

"'The Short Game': Netflix documentary female stars are helping to change golf","https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/15/golf/amari-avery-alexa-pano-netflix-the-short-game-spc-spt-intl/index.html","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT","CNN","
            “How you like me now?” say eight sassy golf whiz kids into the camera, accompanied by the catchy tune of the same name in the Netflix documentary, “The Short Game.”
    

            The year is 2012 and the stars of the show are 1,500 seven and eight-year-old golf prodigies representing 60 different countries, all vying for a chance to become a U.S. Kids World Champion at the daunting Pinehurst course.
    

            Of the eight we meet up close, three are young girls, of whom two come first. Not that it’s all about winning; it’s a raucously fun movie designed to get kids into golf. It’s stressful watching though – the parent-child relationship shown in microscopic detail.
    

            When it was released in 2013, Augusta National had only just accepted its first two female members the previous year in former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and financier and philanthropist Darla Moore. 
    

            Yet with the birth of two tournaments at Augusta before the Masters in April – the Drive, Chip and Putt inaugurated in 2014 and the Augusta National Women’s Amateur (ANWA) – the game is clearly diversifying. 
    

            Junior golfers (age six to 17) in the US now total more than three million with more than one million girls, rising from 25% of the total in 2010 to 34% last year, according to the National Golf Foundation.
    

            On a similar upward curve are Californian Amari Avery and Floridian Alexa Pano, now aged 17 and 16, who won at Pinehurst in their respective USK categories back in 2012. Nine years later, both made the 82-player ANWA field.
    

            “I want to be the first woman to play a tournament at Augusta. Girls are just as good as boys,” says a measured Pano when we first meet her in the Netflix documentary – the girl who is filmed practicing in the rain then shivering because she’s freezing. 
    

            She’s the last to leave the range.
    

            Avery is filmed doing push-ups and sit-ups with her dad Andre and sister Alona for company. She’s now heading to the University of Southern California next year on a golf scholarship and knows the meaning of hard yards.
    

            “You can be a child prodigy and have all the talent in the world, but it won’t get you anywhere if you don’t put in the work,” she told CNN Sport over the phone before winning the inaugural Mack Champ Invitational in Houston in March, an event set up by PGA Tour star Cameron Champ for the game’s best junior golfers from diverse backgrounds.
    

            “I’ve not had to live up to any expectations. I’m my own person away from ‘The Short Game.’ I loved being in it, but I want to be spoken about for winning a big tournament.”
    

            Although neither player made the Saturday finale at Augusta in the 54-hole event – the first two rounds take place at nearby Champions Retreat before a practice round for all competitors at Augusta on the Friday – they have time on their side.
    

            Pano, the youngest competitor this year, just as she was in 2019 when she also missed the cut, has added motivation to return next year.

            Already twice a Drive, Chip and Putt winner at Augusta, Pano missed the ANWA cut as the youngest player in the 2019 field and thus missed the chance to play competitive golf on the undulating layout.
    

            Even though she was able to play Augusta in a practice round, the crowds at the weekend set her competitive fires alight as she watched the then top-ranked amateur, Jennifer Kupcho, play her final six holes in five-under par to be crowned the inaugural champion.
    

            “It was something unlike I’d ever seen in women’s golf. It was super motivating to want to come back this year,” Pano told CNN Sport over the phone from the Gainbridge LPGA in February, before a practice round in the week women’s golf icon and International Golf Federation president Annika Sorenstam made her first competitive appearance in 13 years. 
    

            The current momentum around women’s golf is perhaps something Pano’s grandmother – seen in “The Short Game” superstitiously clutching a packet of Mentos to bring the youngster luck – saw on the horizon before she died in 2013, just after a fourth USK World Championship title for her granddaughter.
    

            “She wanted to watch Alexa compete in a tournament someday at Augusta,” Pano’s devoted father Rick told CNN Sport in an email.
    

            “Alexa told her she was already in the first Drive, Chip and Putt. Her grandmother said: ‘No, there will someday be a women’s tournament at Augusta.’ 
    

            “That was five years before the ANWA was announced. The ANWA is by far the biggest thing that’s ever happened in golf for females.”
    

            The 2019 tournament was the most viewed amateur golf event in the US since 2003 and the most-watched women’s golf event since 2016.
    

            “I think we are going to have some really great effect down the road. It has been terrific,” said Sorenstam after Kupcho’s famous win.
    

            Pano has been exposed to the biggest stage from a very young age, playing the 2016 Yonex Ladies Open in Japan aged 11, the Thornberry Creek LPGA Classic aged 13, and the U.S. Women’s Open aged 14.
    

            She’s been inspired by the likes of Kathy Whitworth – whose 88 LPGA Tour wins outshine Tiger Woods’ and Sam Snead’s 82 in the men’s game – but like so many women, she wants more from golf.
    

            “I can’t complain because I’ve had amazing experiences in the women’s game, but there are so many things that can be improved or more equal. 
    

            “I think everyone out here has had to overcome their own battle, and all that any woman golfer wants is for the attention to be on their golf. Not how they’re dressed.”
    

            Avery says she’s learned a lot from “mentor” Carlota Ciganda – the European Solheim Cup winner who she played alongside as the Spaniard triumphed on the Cactus Tour in late February 2020.
    

            The following week, Avery won her first professional tournament on the same tour, where Women’s Open champion Sophia Popov regained some form before her career breakthrough moment.
    

            “I think women’s golf needs a bit of help because there aren’t many people watching,” added Avery.
    

            “But I’d love to bring some conversation to the table about women’s golf. In future, when I’m done playing, I still want to be a part of it on the business side and help it along.”

            Avery listens to upbeat music, likes rapper Drake, mentions Coco Gauff and Naomi Osaka because she follows tennis “like crazy” and has enjoyed cooking during the pandemic.
    

            There’s a superstitious streak in her family too. If you’re looking for good omens, she shares a December 30 birthday with five-time Masters champion Woods while her initials – ANA – have brought past success at ANA Inspiration host course Mission Hills in California.
    

            It all bodes well for the future, as does the W in ANWA after a promising debut – she made the five-way playoff for the final spot at Augusta but narrowly missed out.
    

            “The W stands for winner (trophy emoji),” says her proud father in an upbeat WhatsApp message.
    

            Meanwhile, Pano jokes that Adele’s music is “clean enough to play with my Dad” but there’s a deeper meaning behind listening to the British superstar.
    

            “I feel like every event I’ve won, this one Adele song would play: Set Fire to the Rain. So that song really resonates with me.”
    

            And their love for Adele isn’t the only connection between golf and music.
    

            Enter former One Direction singer Niall Horan.
    

            Alongside Englishman Mark McDonnell, Irishman Horan co-founded Modest! Golf to help diversify and freshen up the sport.
    

            Having grown up with Justin Rose and no doubt tapping into the 2016 Olympic champion’s mindset, McDonnell hopes with events like the inaugural ISPS Handa World Invitational in Northern Ireland in July – where a mixed field will play for equal money – they can help change the narrative.
    

            “The girls are very passionate about wanting to be seen. If they can be seen, they can inspire. So more TV is the biggest challenge, it’s all to do with platform,” McDonnell told CNN Sport.


            “Angel Yin is 22 and has already competed at two Solheim Cups, she played the US Open aged 13 and she’s a young superstar, but it’s amazing how many people haven’t heard of her and that’s a problem,” added McDonnell, whose company also has German golfer Olivia Cowan and Ireland’s Leona Maguire on their cards.
    

            “We worked with an Irish company, and they interviewed young girls on who their heroes are. Every single one of them mentioned a male sports star. 
    

            “If I had a daughter, I’d want her to have icons of people to look up to. Some of the most successful people in sport and business are females, and they deserve the same platforms as men. That’s our humble opinion and that’s the message we’re going to continue to drive.”
    

            With the LPGA/USGA Girls Golf initiative increasing participation by more than 1,800% from 2010-2020 among females aged six to17 – with a goal of breaking 100,000 by 2022, say the USGA – this is where the game is heading in 2021.

            They’re not even 18, yet Avery and Pano can already look back with immense pride.
    

            “Young girls and even young boys, but mainly young girls, they say they were inspired by the movie to take up golf. That was the main thing we wanted to come out of it,” said Pano.
    

            “I see my Instagram DMs and when I get to meet them in person and they say that, it’s the best feeling.”

            Hot Stocks 




            George Sherman may still be the CEO of meme stock poster child GameStop. But it looks like Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen is really running the show. 
    

            GameStop 
            
                (GME)said Thursday that it planned to nominate Cohen, whose investment firm RC Ventures owns a nearly 13% stake in the company, to be its next chairman following GameStop’s annual meeting on June 9. 
    

            The company also said Thursday that following the annual meeting, all board directors will be compensated entirely in stock – which presumably will motivate them to take action to boost the price further. Board members will also have their compensation reduced by nearly 30% from a year earlier.

GameStop CFO resigns a month after the Reddit trading frenzy


            Shares of GameStop were down 5% in late afternoon trading following the news. 
    

            The stock has been incredibly volatile this year thanks to a push from fans on social media site Reddit, who have been betting on a turnaround and battling short sellers that are betting the stock will go down. 
    

            GameStop shares are up 800% in 2021 – but are currently trading 65% below their peak price from late January. 
    

            Bulls hope that Cohen, who helped build online pet supplies store Chewy
            
                (CHWY) into a digital commerce juggernaut, will be able to work his e-commerce magic with GameStop too.
    

            GameStop named Cohen as the head of a strategic planning and capital allocation committee in early March. As part of that role, Cohen was expected to strengthen GameStop’s online commerce operations.
    

            The company has already taken several steps to do that, hiring several executives from Chewy and Amazon
            
                (AMZN) to help lead the company’s transformation.

El-Erian: Robinhood is a reminder that 'you have no friends on Wall Street'


            GameStop, like many retailers, has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic. Sales in its most recent quarter were down 3% from a year ago and below Wall Street expectations. 
    

            But GameStop had been struggling even before coronavirus, in large part because of a shift to more online and mobile games that could be downloaded directly to phones, consoles, PCs and tablets.
    

            Enter Cohen, who first took a stake in GameStop in September 2020. His influence on the retailer is bearing fruit. Although overall sales were down during the holiday 2020 period, online sales more than doubled. E-commerce now accounts for more than a third of total revenue, up from just 12% in the fourth quarter of 2019.

"A Banksy painting celebrating nurses as superheroes sells for a record-breaking $23M","https://www.cnn.com/style/article/banksy-game-changer-christies-record-sale/index.html","Wed, 24 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","CNN","
            A painting by the artist Banksy honoring UK healthcare workers has set a new record for the artist, selling for £16.7 million ($23.1 million) at Christie’s in London. 
    

            “Game Changer,” which the enigmatic street artist donated to the University Hospital Southampton (UHS) in May of 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic, depicts a young child playing with a toy nurse wearing a Red Cross emblem, a cape and face mask. In a nearby basket, figurines of Batman and Spiderman lay forgotten. 
    


Banksy confirms prison-escape mural is his with Bob Ross-inspired video


            The work sold for over four times its high estimate of £3.5 million ($4.8 million) and nearly doubled Banksy’s previous record, the 2009 oil-on-canvas “Devolved Parliament” of British politicians as chimpanzees in the House of Commons, which sold for £9.9 million ($13.6 million) at Sotheby’s in 2019.
    

            The proceeds from the hammer price will be donated to University Hospital Southampton as well health organizations and charities across the country, according to the auction house.
    

            Until now, “Game Changer” had only been seen on display at the hospital (a reproduction will now replace it). When Banksy donated the work, he included a note that read: “Thanks for all you’re doing. I hope this brightens the place up a bit, even if its only black and white.”
    

            At the time, UHS chief executive Paula Head called it “an inspirational backdrop to pause and reflect in these unprecedented times,” in a tweet.
    


 'Aachoo!!': Banksy confirms new sneezing woman mural as his latest work


            Christie’s has described the work as capturing “the simple, universal values that have come to the fore during the pandemic - family, home and time spent with loved ones.” The painting is a heartfelt moment for an artist who often plays up his sardonic appeal. In 2018, Banksy made headlines when his iconic work, “Girl With Balloon,” self-destructed just after selling for $1.4 million at Sotheby’s (the spray-paint-on-canvas composition, which had been half-shredded in its frame, was then renamed “Love is in the Bin”). 
    

            “Game Changer” was not Banksy’s only pandemic work. Three months after the donation, Banksy left stenciled rats with face masks around the London Underground – which were promptly removed for violating Transport for London’s “strict anti-graffiti policy.” Then, in December, he left a mural of a woman violently sneezing on the side of a home in Totterdown. Though Banksy has yet to reveal his identity, many of his early works in and around Bristol, including the playful work “Aachoo!!,” have led to speculation that he is from the area.

"The first hotel is opening on this NYC island with a notorious past","https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/graduate-hotel-roosevelt-island-new-york/index.html","Fri, 26 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","CNN","
            New York City’s Roosevelt Island will soon receive hotel guests for the first time – a new set of arrivals to a slim, two mile long island in the East River with an eye-opening past and a high-tech future. 
    

            The 224-room Graduate Roosevelt Island opens to guests on June 1. Sitting at the entrance of Cornell Tech’s innovative new campus, the 18-story tower will be the Graduate brand’s 29th property and its first in the city.
    

            “To be able to have a hotel in New York City still rooted to a campus, still rooted to a major university like Cornell … and really what is supposed to be the gateway to the tech industry for New York City, was a really unique opportunity for us,” said David Rochefort, president at Graduate Hotels and a Cornell alum.
    


Hoping to travel this year? What you need to know 


            The growing graduate-level Cornell Tech campus – the first phase of which opened in 2017 – is a new chapter for Roosevelt Island, which earned attention in the 19th century for its penitentiary and workhouses, a smallpox hospital and an asylum for the mentally ill.
    

            Pioneering investigative journalist Nellie Bly pretended to be mentally ill to be admitted to the asylum, resulting in an 1887 series called “Ten Days in a Mad-House” that exposed abuses and poor conditions at the facility.
    

            Traces of that troubling history remain on the island, but now gleaming 21st-century buildings are springing up at Cornell Tech. The Graduate aims to bridge old and new, with nods to the island’s history, Cornell’s past and a state-of-the-art future.
    

            The lobby incorporates tactile nods to old-school education with a laptop-compatible library table, complete with domed task lamps and textbooks stacked to the ceiling. 
    

            “We love this idea that our lobby would kind of be rooted in the past as much as possible. So one of the things we did is install 5,000 linear feet of textbooks across the entire lobby backdrop,” said Rochefort.
    

            Students and professionals who are learning and building businesses “literally across the courtyard from us” will find a different perspective from “the future and what they’re building for tomorrow,” he said.
    


Roosevelt Island: Best things to do on this hidden New York gem


            The space is playful, too. A giant boy in aviator goggles holds a light bulb over the front desk (a 12-foot Hebru Brantley sculpture reinterpreting the artist’s Flyboy character). 
    

            As in all the Graduate properties, hotel key cards are designed to look like college IDs – in this case featuring Cornell University alums (from the main campus in Ithaca, New York) with significant ties to New York City (Ruth Bader Ginsburg, for one).
    

            Interiors are the work of Graduate Hotels’ in-house design team. The building’s architecture, which optimizes views of Manhattan, Queens and beyond, is by design firms Snøhetta and Stonehill Taylor.
    

            In the rooms, accented with collegiate plaid, there are light fixtures inspired by a science project by a Cornell alum and lamp bases that feature a Morse code rendition of Cornell’s fight song.
    


Travel to New York City during Covid-19: What you need to know before you go


            Work by New York artists includes some fun references to both Bly and actress Mae West, who spent some time locked up on the island in 1927 on public obscenity charges.
    

            Crowning the hotel, a futuristic rooftop bar and event space will feature sweeping views and a menu created by New York City natives Med Abrous and Marc Rose, the Los Angeles-based restaurateurs responsible for food and beverage at several Graduate locations.
    

            Originally called Minnahanonck, the island was purchased from Native Americans by the Dutch in 1637 and acquired by the city of New York in 1828. By then, it was known as Blackwell’s Island. 
    

Blackwell House, a recently refurbished 1796 farmhouse, belonged to the family that owned the island when it was purchased by the city. It’s open to the public.
    

            The island later became known as Welfare Island and was renamed Roosevelt Island in 1973 to honor President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
    

Four Freedoms Park, on the southern tip, memorializes its current namesake. 
    

            While most of its early buildings are gone, there are some historic sites. The ivy-entwined ruins of the smallpox hospital – designed by Smithsonian Institution architect James Renwick Jr. – make for an imposing reminder of some of Roosevelt Island’s 19th- and 20th-century history and the park on the northern tip is anchored by a Renwick-designed lighthouse.
    


What the experts say about whether you should travel


            An octagonal tower that was part of the asylum for the mentally ill has been folded into an apartment development – part of the island’s more recent transformation. 
    

            The island is accessible by car, the F Train and the aerial Tramway, which opened in 1976 and offers the most scenic way to get there.
    

Graduate Roosevelt Island, managed by Highgate, will welcome guests on June 1. Reservations are now open. The starting room rate is $219 per night. Graduate Cares Covid-19 safety measures are in place.

"Atlanta Braves cover All-Star Game patch on team jerseys after MLB's decision to move game","https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/04/us/atlanta-braves-all-star-patch/index.html","Sun, 04 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT","CNN","
            The Atlanta Braves altered their uniforms Saturday ahead of their game against the Philadelphia Phillies, with the All-Star Game patch the team sported on their jersey’s for opening day noticeably sewn over.
    

            The alteration came after Major League Baseball announced they were pulling the 2021 All-Star Game from Georgia – in response to the recently passed state law that critics say would make it harder to vote.
    

            “I’m disappointed that it’s not going to be there,” Braves Manager Brian Snitker told reporters before Saturday’s game. “But I’m focused on playing baseball and what we’ve got going on this season. Other than being disappointed, that’s all I have to say on it.”
    

            Braves starting pitcher Charlie Morton also shared his thoughts on the league’s decision.  
    

            “I’m disappointed for the Braves organization and those who are local who would have benefited seeing the influx of business and excitement in the area. It’s a bad situation,” Morton said. 
    

            Shortly after MLB announced the game’s relocation, the Braves released a statement saying they were disappointed by the league’s decision. 
    

            “This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city,” the statement read. “Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are victims of this decision.”
    

            The “estimated lost economic impact” from the relocation is more than $100 million, according to a statement from Holly Quinlan, president of Cobb Travel and Tourism.

North Korea has reportedly decided drop out of the forthcoming Tokyo Olympics due to concerns its athletes could contract coronavirus.  
    

            North Korea decided to sever almost all of its ties with the outside world in 2020 to prevent an influx of coronavirus cases. The country has not reported a major outbreak of Covid-19, and there have been no indications one has taken place, though experts doubt Pyongyang’s claim the country has not seen a single case of the virus.
    

            Foreign diplomats and aid workers have also fled the country en masse in recent months, citing shortages of goods and extreme restrictions on daily life, according to the Russian Embassy in Pyongyang.
    

            According to a report published Tuesday on DPRK Sports, a state media outlet focused on sports affairs, North Korean officials announced that the country would not be participating in this summer’s Games in order to “protect players from the world public health crisis caused by Covid-19.”
    

            The decision was made by the DPRK (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea) Olympic Committee, which held a video conference meeting with committee members and sports officials on March 25 in Pyongyang, DPRK Sports reported.

            The Games are currently scheduled to take place from July 23 to August 8. The Paralympics will follow, from August 24 to September 5.
    

            This is the first time North Korea has missed the Olympics since it boycotted the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. In 2018, the leaders of two Koreas agreed to pursue co-hosting the Olympic Games in 2032, but the inter-Korean discussion on the matter ceased in 2019.
    

            The Olympic Games were originally scheduled for 2020, but organizers were forced to postpone the Olympics for the first time in the event’s history due to the pandemic.

The Olympic flame starts its final leg to Tokyo. Some suggest this day should never have come


            The first event of the Games, the Olympic Torch Relay, officially launched on March 25. The Olympic Flame is now on its way across the country, carried by 10,000 runners through 47 prefectures in a 121-day journey from Fukushima to Tokyo.
    

            But the resumption of the Games was a controversial choice, with mounting logistical challenges and concerns about the pandemic. Officials in Japan have expressed concern over a possible “fourth wave” in the pandemic and Osaka city has canceled its Olympic Torch relay events citing a rise in cases. 
    

            Though public support for the event in Japan continues to be muted, organizers have pushed ahead. The Games is likely to look very different this year, however. Last month, the Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee said international spectators would be refused entry into Japan due to the prevalence of the coronavirus in the country and abroad. The Paralympics would also not be welcoming traveling fans, said the committee.

"GameStop CEO George Sherman is stepping down, sending the stock soaring","https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/19/investing/gamestop-ceo-george-sherman-ryan-cohen/index.html","Mon, 19 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT","CNN","Markets

            Hot Stocks 




            It’s game over for GameStop CEO George Sherman. The video game retailer and meme stock announced Monday that Sherman will be stepping down on July 31 — or earlier if a successor is found. 
    

            The news is not a major surprise given that Ryan Cohen, the co-founder and former CEO of online pet supplies retailer Chewy
            
                (CHWY), has been cementing his control over GameStop. 
    

            Cohen, whose RC Ventures firm owns a nearly 13% stake in the company, will become GameStop
            
                (GME) chairman following its next shareholder meeting in early June. 
    

            Shares of GameStop rose 6.3% Monday. 
    

            Sherman, a veteran retail executive who has only been CEO of GameStop since April 2019, inherited a tough job when he took over two years ago. 
    

            “I am very proud of what we have accomplished at GameStop over the past two years, including during the difficult Covid-19 pandemic,” Sherman said in a statement. “We have helped bring stability and strength to the business.” 
    

            Sherman was charged with turning around GameStop at a time when many gaming console sales were declining and people were increasingly downloading new games instead of buying them from stores. Shortly after Sherman joined the company, he announced plans to close up to 200 stores.
    

            “GameStop appreciates the valuable leadership that George has provided throughout his tenure. He took many decisive steps to stabilize the business during challenging times. The Company is much stronger today than when he joined,” Cohen said in a statement.
    

            But Sherman never really got much of a chance to execute his turnaround plan. The onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020 upended the economic landscape for the entire retail industry. GameStop was forced to temporarily close stores.

Hedge funds are getting crushed by the worst short squeeze in a quarter century


            Enter Cohen. He took a stake in late 2020, news that excited a revolution of traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets board who believed that Cohen could get GameStop back on track. 
    

            GameStop became the quintessential meme stock in January, as social media fans battled hedge funds who were betting the stock would go down. Lawmakers on Capitol Hill even held hearings about the stock’s surge and how it was handled by online trading giant Robinhood.
    

            GameStop’s stock is up more than 700% this year – although shares are trading nearly 70% below the Reddit-infused all-time high from late January.
    

            Cohen has been asserting more control over GameStop since he invested in the company. In the past year, GameStop has hired several executives from Chewy and Amazon to help lead the company’s transformation into more of an online retailer.
    

            Te transition is showing some early signs of success. 
    

            Although overall sales in GameStop’s most recent quarter were down 3% from a year ago and below Wall Street expectations, online sales more than doubled. E-commerce now accounts for more than a third of total revenue, up from just 12% in the fourth quarter of 2019.

"MLB's decision to move its All-Star Game out of Georgia will have a $100 million impact on the state, tourism official says","https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/03/us/mlb-all-star-game-relocation-lost-money-economic-impact/index.html","Sat, 03 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT","CNN","
            Major League Baseball’s decision to move its All-Star Game from Georgia in response to a new restrictive voting law is likely to cost the state tens of millions of dollars.
    

            The “estimated lost economic impact” from the relocation is more than $100 million, according to a statement from Holly Quinlan, president and CEO of Cobb Travel and Tourism.
    

            This comes as the tourism industry, one of the hardest hit during the Covid-19 pandemic, is still struggling to rebound.
    

            “In the initial stages of the pandemic, many Cobb [County] hotels saw single digit occupancy numbers,” Quinlan said. “The 8,000-plus MLB contracted hotel room nights that will not actualize as a result of the MLB All-Star Game relocation will have a negative impact on Cobb’s hospitality industry and other local businesses, further delaying recovery.”

Big businesses side with Democrats in clash over voting rights


            MLB announced Friday that this season’s All-Star Game and draft will not be held in Atlanta in response to the recently passed law in the state that critics say would make it harder to vote.
    

            The Atlanta Braves said the franchise is “deeply disappointed” by the decision to move the game
    

            “This was neither our decision, nor our recommendation and we are saddened that fans will not be able to see this event in our city,” according to a statement from the team. “Unfortunately, businesses, employees, and fans in Georgia are the victims of this decision.”
    

            Several leaders of Georgia-based companies have also criticized the law, including Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian and Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey.
    

            The legislation, which was signed last week by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, imposes voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes, and makes it a crime to approach voters to give them food and water as they wait in line.

            Immediately after MLB announced the move, state Republicans behind the law blamed some of its leading Democratic critics – including Stacey Abrams, a Georgia Democrat and voting rights advocate.
    

            Kemp on Saturday continued to blame President Joe Biden and Abrams for the recent backlash he received from companies in the state and said he “will not be backing down from this fight.”
    

            “Cancel culture and partisan activists are coming for your business,” Kemp said at a press conference. “Major League Baseball, Coca-Cola and Delta may be scared of Stacey Abrams, Joe Biden and the left, but I am not.” 
    

            Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a Democrat, told CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield that MLB’s decision “is really probably the first of many boycotts of our state to come.”
    

            The mayor said on Twitter that “until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed,” she expects Georgia to suffer many more consequences.

"Getting vaccinated is a game changer","https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/18/opinions/leftover-covid-19-vaccine-game-changer-wierson/index.html","Thu, 18 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","CNN","

            I am a 49-year-old man in fairly good shape (although I could always stand to lose a few pounds here and there.) My wife is 37, and in far better shape. Either way, according to federal and state guidelines, we are low risk for suffering complications stemming from Covid-19 and we would likely not have been vaccinated for several months based on our age and health profile; nonetheless, last week we were both able to get our shots by showing up at a vaccination center unannounced.
    

            There have been reports of areas around the country not allowing unused vaccines to be given to groups that don’t match its state’s vaccination eligibility requirements, causing leftover doses to be tossed out. We had heard that there was a particular chain of pharmacies that was administering vaccinations for seniors, first responders and others who qualified that was also allowing walk-ins to take advantage of the spots left by no-shows and unfilled appointments – so no vaccines would go to waste. Experts have agreed that if there is a choice between throwing away an unused dose and giving it to someone who is not yet eligible, then it’s better to do the latter. 
    

            With no appointment, we rolled the dice and drove out to a rural pharmacy almost an hour from our home near Minneapolis, hanging around until the end of the day to see if there would be any unused doses. And as luck would have it, there were three no-shows, and my wife and I were able to get two of those last three unclaimed shots, which would’ve expired and had to be tossed. Even better, we both received the recently approved Johnson & Johnson, “one-and-done” Janssen vaccination. The trip out to the rural pharmacy soaked up the better part of an afternoon, but we were done. Whew. 
    

            What I didn’t anticipate from that afternoon trek into the countryside was how much that one little dose of vaccine would free me from the psychological confinement I had felt ever since the pandemic disrupted daily life. It made me realize that even “younger-ish” Americans like myself and my wife have been carrying around a big mental burden. The quick shot of vaccine enabled me to shed, almost immediately, the fear and apprehension that I had been living with during this year of lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing.
    

            With that one tiny jab in my left shoulder, I was almost immediately overcome with a sensation that was as foreign to me as it was familiar – one that has been an integral part of my personality my entire life but that had somehow managed to dissipate if not entirely disappear over the course of the past year: My sense of self-confidence and my ability to confront the world around me without fear.

I got vaccinated. What now?


            It made me fully realize the toll that the pandemic had taken on my mental health. No longer did I subconsciously attempt to evaluate the risk profile of fellow shoppers while standing six feet apart in the checkout line at Target – which one of these people might have the coronavirus? No longer was I overcome with the fear that, despite taking all of the recommended precautions, I might inadvertently infect my elderly parents when visiting them at their home. My wife and I suddenly felt it was safe again to go out to eat – of course while still following the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines for fully vaccinated people – spend money, and do our small part to get the economy humming again. 
    

            Just knowing that we are vaccinated is a game changer; we now have some reasonable measure of defense against this mysterious virus that upended nearly every facet of our lives – and that of the rest of the country – almost exactly one year ago. Despite the talk of mutations and variants and that some vaccines might be more effective than others, I now know that if I am confronted with Covid-19, I have a fighting chance. 
    

            When the coronavirus outbreak began, we had no therapeutic treatments, and more importantly, no vaccine in sight. Adding fuel to the fire was the patently obvious sense that our government at the time – specifically former President Donald Trump – was fumbling its response, seemingly in complete denial about the seriousness of the virus, and splitting the country into two over the issue.

            Covid-19 will be a permanent part of our society’s psychological landscape. The post-mortem on Covid-19, our government’s response to it and its long-lasting effects on our psyche and our economy will be the source of endless debate and discussion for decades to come. The youngest of my three children, now ages 4 and 7, will likely forever be branded as part of Gen C (the “C” is for Covid), the emerging consensus name for the demographic cohort that follows Gen Z – a lifelong reminder that they grew up and survived the biggest global pandemic since the early 1900s. 
    

            For all of us, Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z and now Gen C, Covid-19 has changed our world, but the impact of getting that vaccine will go far beyond merely defending us against taking ill; it will garner many of us the fortitude to return to the modicum of normalcy that we have craved for so long.
