"GameStop: Reddit users investing in gorilla conservation","https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56438230","Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","""Apes Together Strong"" is a popular saying in Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, and some users are taking that seriously.
Reddit users have been symbolically adopting apes and donating to foundations including The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, external and the World Wildlife Fund. 
Some users are naming GameStop, or GME as they're known on the New York Stock Exchange, as the adopter.
Donations have exceeded $350,000 (£250,000) in less than a week.
The foundation tweeted that the funds will go towards their field programmes where they track, monitor and study gorillas in their natural habitats.

The Fossey Fund said they were ""surprised, thrilled and appreciative of the grassroots donations that have come our way thanks to a group of investors on Reddit."" 
""We thank these new donors for their contributions to the success of our mission - because in saving gorillas, we save the planet.""
The Fossey Fund has also added ""Apes Together Strong"" to their website.
The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund has added WallStreetBet's phrase ""Apes Together Strong"" to their homepage after receiving a large number of donations from users.
The trend started when the user Pakistani_in_MURICA posted an adoption certificate, external in WallStreetBets on Friday. 
The user had adopted a gorilla named Urungano and listed GameStop as its sponsor.
The post won a bevvy of awards and karma - Reddit's way of liking content - and inspired a number of fellow users to adopt or donate. 
""I have three adopted infant Gorillas now. Sorry but animals are my kryptonite,"" one Redditor commented.
""This is good stuff! Gogo /WSB [WallStreetBets]!! This is the sort of thing that happens when people unaccustomed to having money suddenly get some.""
WallStreetBets made headlines earlier this year when a number of amateur investors from the site bought GameStop stock. 
As a result, GameStop's share price spiked, causing huge losses for some hedge funds that had positions betting against GameStop.
Users on WallStreetBets often refer to themselves as ""apes"".
This baby gorilla was symbolically adopted by a user on WallStreetBets who named GameStop as the sponsor.
The Fossey Fund's website says their conservation work is focused on mountain gorillas in Rwanda and Grauer's gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
Their website lists six gorillas up for adoption - and ranging from $60 (£43) to $150 (£107).

"Bafta Games Awards 2021: Hades takes Best Game","https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-56528581","Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","Hades has won Best Game at the 2021 Bafta Games Awards.
The Ancient Greek-themed action adventure was the big winner of the night, taking away five awards in total.
The title, made for PC and Nintendo Switch, has been commended by critics for its unique art style and distinctive gameplay.
Fans voted voted The Last of Us Part 2 as the EE Game of the Year.
Sackboy: A Big Adventure took the British Game, Animal Crossing: New Horizons won in the Multiplayer category and the Game Design award went to Hades.
It was the second time the awards ceremony was held online due to lockdown.

Completing Hades in the middle of a pandemic had its challenges but it's something Greg Kasavin, creative director at Supergiant Games, will never forget.
""The trust that we put in each other - both was tested in some respects but was really just it's what got us through into this,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.
""It's something to never, ever take for granted - that as a group, we all believe in each other in this way.""
Studio director and co-founder Amir Rao agrees: ""Hades was a game that a lot of people played for a long time, and hopefully it helped them in some way, and they came out with a lasting positive impression as a result of their time with it.""
Analysis by Steffan Powell, Newsbeat gaming reporter
Bosses sitting in PlayStation HQ will have a big smile on their faces after watching this year's ceremony.
Titles that are exclusive to Sony's consoles walked away with almost half of the awards up for grabs on the night.
From Ghost of Tsushima to Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Sackboy: A Big Adventure, PlayStations's knack of making exclusive games which resonate with players was clearly on show.
However, the big winner of the night was action roleplaying game Hades which walked away with five golden masks - some achievement for a team of only 20 developers at Supergiant Games.
Hades was the night's big winners
Aside from the winners and losers, the ceremony also took the opportunity to celebrate the positive role that games have played in boosting people's mental and social wellbeing in lockdown. 
From winners' speeches, to presenter commentary and videos that were shown during the event - the industry used the shop window that Bafta provides to try and keep changing the perception of gaming as just a pastime. 
The message was clear: The industry wants those who've turned to games in recent months to become ambassadors and encourage more people to pick up a controller.
A record-breaking 13 nominations this year meant Naughty Dog's title The Last of Us Part 2 was always expected to do well.
In the end, it won three awards: Audience-voted Game of the Year, Animation and Performer in a Leading Role, for Laura Bailey.
Last of Us 2 was nominated for a number of awards including best game
It won big at the 2020 Game awards and was crowned BBC Sounds podcast Press X to Continue's game of 2020. 
Despite controversies over its depiction of violence, divisive plot twists and character portrayals, the title had an overwhelmingly positive reaction from players and critics. 
Right from host Elle Osili-Wood's opening speech, the positives of gaming during lockdown kept coming up.
""Games, and the developers behind them, have proven themselves to be more essential than ever,"" she said.
""In 2020, games connected us in a way that wouldn't have been possible a decade ago.""
So it wasn't a surprise when Animal Crossing: New Horizons - one of ""the"" games of lockdown for many people - won two awards.
The Nintendo title won in the Multiplayer category, and also took the Game Beyond Entertainment award - which recognised ""games that made us think and made us feel"".
Siobhan Reddy was honoured with a Bafta Fellowship for her work as studio director of games company Media Molecule - the team behind games such as LittleBigPlanet and Dreams, the game creation software made for PlayStation.
The accolade comes in recognition of her ""pioneering work on advocacy for diversity, inclusion and creative and collaborative working culture"".

""It's incredibly humbling. I went through a lot of emotions, and I came out the other end of just feeling incredibly grateful, incredibly moved, and incredibly motivated. I'm totally delighted,"" Siobhan tells Newsbeat.

"Roblox: 'We paid off our parents' mortgage making video games'","https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56354253","Fri, 12 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","Ben and Matt have turned a hobby into a living
When identical twins Ben and Matt Horton began making serious money from creating video games, their parents couldn't believe it.
""It was quite bizarre at first, because I was doing a paper round and they were blown away,"" says Ben. ""They said there was no way a paper round can make this much.""
His brother Matt adds: ""It was a significant amount of money. They thought we were doing shady stuff online.""
As it turned out, the brothers had produced their first big hit - a game called Boat Ride, launched on the online gaming platform Roblox - and they were just 13.
Seven years later, Ben and Matt work full-time on gaming, with Ben specialising on the software side and Matt doing video production.
Their games have been played more than 100 million times and each of them earns £100,000 a year.
How the children's game became a $30bn bet on the Metaverse
Roblox: David Baszucki worth $4.6bn as shares soar
It all began as a hobby when the pair had some free time over the Christmas holidays. They were already enthusiastic gamers on Roblox and found it easy to start developing their own games.
""Anyone can learn, a 10-year-old kid can learn to make a game,"" says Ben.
Now the brothers share a flat in their hometown of Crawley, having dropped out of sixth-form to concentrate full-time on game development. Their closeness as twins is important to them.
""We're not telepathic, but I kind of know what he's thinking and he knows what I'm thinking,"" says Matt. ""In our whole life, we've not spent more than two days apart from each other.""
Despite their new-found wealth, the two say they are ""not big spenders"" and are ""not very materialistic"".
Treating the family to a holiday and helping to pay off their parents' mortgage have been their biggest items of expenditure, with most of their income invested.
""We just want to be able to live comfortably for the rest of our lives,"" says Ben.
Roblox has seen huge success built on the work of developers like Ben and Matt.
It's already the world's largest user-generated games site, and its value rose 60% to $47bn after its first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Versatility is one of the key reasons it's been a hit, says Candice Mudrick, head of market analysis at gaming data company Newzoo.
""The Roblox business model is more than a game - it's a platform that encourages creators to build experiences for other users. While many games have some form of user-generated content, it's more uncommon to find games whose entire business model is built upon it,"" she says.
But competition is stiff among top developers on the platform. The firm recently said that more than 1,250 developers earned at least $10,000 in robux, the platform's currency which can be converted to cash, in 2020. Only about 300 earned $100,000 or more.
""This indicates that although the broader creator community is strong, the top earners are still a small group,"" said Ms Mudrick.
She added that a big challenge for the firm and its army of developers will be ""maintaining its young audience as they age, while at the same time also expanding to new, older, demographics"".
Quinn Byron-Dyer was an intern at Roblox's San Mateo headquarters in California while at university
Quinn Byron-Dyer started playing Roblox when he was just 10 years old.
A decade later, he was at intern at the company's head office in San Mateo, California, and he now supports himself through his work as a Roblox developer. 
Quinn, now 22, says playing and building games on the platform initially appealed to his ""creative side"".
""I got more seriously into developing stuff about 2015 onwards and from then, the money just built up from there I guess,"" he says.
A recent graduate with a degree in computer games design, he believes that Roblox is popular because it's ""really easy to get into"".
""You don't need any requirements, you can start making stuff for free, you don't have to have any qualifications.""
And importantly, Roblox provides the audience. ""It is so much easier to get people playing your game when there's already loads of people playing similar games out there,"" Quinn says.
How much has he earned from Roblox? He says he's not sure. 
But as someone who has worked on hit games such as Murder Mystery 2, which has been visited 4.4 billion times, Quinn is looking forward to getting his own place once he moves out of his parents' house, post-pandemic of course.
How do his parents feel about his career? ""They were obviously a bit unsure at first, about what it all means,"" he says. ""Because it was all very new, quite a new industry, it took a bit for them to understand what it was all about, but they are supportive of it.""
Fiona is also known as ""xbutterflies"" on the Roblox platform
Fiona, meanwhile, joined the platform in 2008.
She's a developer based in Toronto who teamed up with her partner to create Super Power Fighting Simulator. The action game, in which players enter different realms and fight battles, has attracted more than 100 million users. 
She says that level of popularity generates about $30,000 to $40,000 per month.
""Roblox has changed my life,"" she says. ""I went from playing Roblox every day as a kid, to making a successful income from it.""
""I've seen many young developers who have been able to make millions per year from developing on Roblox,"" she adds.
Fiona made the decision to buy shares in company on its stock market debut, and is keen to keep working on Roblox games. ""I'm excited to see where Roblox takes us within the next five to ten years,"" she says.

"Are in-app purchases ruining mobile video games?","https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-56215030","Mon, 01 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","We know more people are playing video games in the pandemic.
Not all of those will be sitting down to play on their consoles or PCs.
Recent research suggests that one in two people with a smartphone will have played a game on their phone in the last week, external. 
How many of those games make money however has been a consistent talking point, external within the gaming industry for years.
The techniques some developers use to hook and retain players, however, are controversial.
Particularly when games advertised as ""free"" come with in-app purchases, sometimes known as microtransactions.

""If money hinders you from playing this game that's posing as free-to-play, but it's not - that's what frustrates me,"" says Jay-Ann Lopez, founder of Black Girl Gamers, talking on this week's BBC Sounds Press X to Continue podcast.
""If you want people to pay for your game, give [them] an upfront fee. I would gladly pay for a game to download onto my phone that I'm going to enjoy forever. 
""I don't want to be advertised to all the time. And I think it's becoming quite dangerous, how advertisements are everywhere. 
""When it comes to these mobile games, and they stop you from actually enjoying the game until you pay; I don't enjoy that kind of financial model.""
Research suggests that the amount of money players spent on mobile games globally increased by 13% year-on-year from 2017 to 2018 - with around £50 billion spent on them in total, external. 
Press X to Continue reviewer Inel Tomlinson, has some sympathy for studios trying to make mobile games: ""I do think it's a lot harder for developers to charge upfront costs.
""The latest Professor Layton game came out on mobile before it came out on the Nintendo Switch. And on mobile, it cost twenty quid, and everyone's like - 'I ain't touching that. Twenty quid for a mobile game? You're having a laugh'.
""It came out on the Switch for £40 - the same game. Everyone bought it.""
Trying to stand out in a saturated mobile game market is hard.
A recent trend in mobile games forces players to wait until they can access certain levels or items - unless, of course, they're prepared to pay for the privilege - and it's these kinds of techniques that irritate some gamers. 
""In certain mobile games, for instance, you play for ten minutes. And then it's like, 'oh, you've now run out of lives',"" says comedian Glenn Moore.
""Your lives replenish in 24 hours, or you can buy some now and I'm like, 'is this a game being really irresponsible about my finances? Or is the game being really responsible for my playtime?' 
""I think it's the first one. It's definitely the first one.""

""[Developers of mobile games] have got to make money. So I understand that you've got to think of new ways of doing it,"" says podcast host Steffan Powell.
""When monetisation gets in the way of the experience? That's when I start questioning it.""
But while there is so much money to be made there will still be plenty of games that rely on this funding model.

"Police bust 'world's biggest' video-game-cheat operation","https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56579449","Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","Several luxury sports cars were among assets seized in the raid
A collaborative effort between Chinese police and gaming giant Tencent has led to the closure of what police say is the biggest ever video-game-cheat operation.
The gang designed and sold cheats to popular video games, including Overwatch and Call of Duty Mobile.
Roughly $76m (£55m) in revenue was made by the organisation which charged a subscription fee to clients.
Police seized assets worth $46m, including several luxury cars. 
China's Tencent revenues surge thanks to gaming boom
'Interest in e-sports will only grow and grow'
The operation was called ""Chicken Drumstick"", and had a website selling to ""hundreds of countries and regions"", local media reported.
Subscription prices for users began at around $10 a day, and up to $200 a month.
Ten people were arrested during the raid in Kunshan, a city near Shanghai
Kunshan police found and destroyed 17 cheats and arrested 10 people in connection with the ring. 
It said it was the ""world's biggest"" cheating case due to the large sums of money and games involved.

The cheat hackers ‘ruining’ gaming for others
With players able to win millions in gaming tournaments around the world, a crackdown on cheating has intensified in recent years. 
In 2019, a survey revealed around a third of gamers admit to using cheats to improve their chances online.
Several high-profile gamers have also quit platforms over the rise of cheating on some games.
Cheating in gaming is as old as gaming itself.
But with the rise of player-versus-player titles and online competitions, cheating is no longer just about giving yourself an advantage over the computer baddies.
Cheating is literally ruining gaming and large companies like Tencent know it.
This latest operation shows how seriously the Chinese company, and other games-makers, are taking the issue.
It comes off the back of large public displays of aggression towards cheaters in other titles like Warzone and Fortnite.
The story also shows just how lucrative these cheat-hacking operations have become.
What used to be a cottage industry of hackers exposing glitches in the code of games has now become a massive criminal enterprise.

"Roblox: How the children's game became a $30bn bet on the Metaverse","https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56345586","Wed, 10 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","David Baszucki, is about to become a very rich man, as his video-game platform, Roblox, floats on the New York Stock Exchange, valued at a cool $30bn (£21.6bn).
Already, he has bigger ambitions for the game, which he hopes can become the centre of the so-called Metaverse - an online world not just for gaming but for work and learning, too.
But what is the appeal of a title whose audience mainly consists of the under-12s?
And can its future lie beyond games?
Roblox is already the world's largest user-generated games site. Players use core building components to create and share online worlds that anyone can explore. 
It is free to play, relying on purchases paid for in currency known as robux.
Game-makers earn robux, which can be converted back into cash. 
More than 1,250 developers earned at least $10,000 in robux in 2020. More than 300 earned $100,000 or more.
The versatility of Roblox is a huge part of its success, thinks Louise Shorthouse, a senior games analyst at Ampere Research.
""It is not just a game, it is a platform to create games,"" she explains.
""It is a bit of a marketplace where you can pick and choose whether you play an adventure game, a shooter or a puzzle. And a lot of it is free to play, which is good for children.""
It is available on a variety of devices, from PCs and Xbox to apps on iPhones and Android devices, allowing users to play each other regardless of which machine they are using.
There's pent-up demand for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch releases, too, so potentially, it has lots of further room to grow.
Lockdown provided a huge boost to Roblox, as children, physically cut off from their friends, flocked to it.
Not only could they play games with their mates, they could visit virtual theme parks, attend concerts, birthday parties and chat to others.
Daily active users jumped 85% in 2020 and it now has 37 million globally. 
Three in four US children aged between nine and 12 are on it, as is one in two UK-based 10-year-olds.
And as of January, the number who played it at least once a month was just shy of 200 million, according to tracking site RTrack, external, marking a 67% increase on the same month a year earlier.

One of the most remarkable things about Roblox is the amount of time people spend there - an average of two hours 36 minutes per day.
But with its huge growth in numbers and popularity, come issues. Scammers and hackers lurk, ready to steal kids' hard-earned robux, and there have also been reports of attempts to groom children.
Mr Baszucki's plans don't stop at gaming. He hopes Roblox can become part of that Metaverse, a series of interconnected digital worlds where people hang out, work and learn.
Can Roblox move beyond games?
The term was coined in Neal Stephenson's 1992 science-fiction novel Snow Crash, where it served as a virtual-reality-based successor to the internet.
Similar ideas have been around for a long time - gamers and game makers in particular have long dreamt of virtual worlds where they could live out their lives, and lockdown gave everyone a glimpse of such a life.
""The idea was amplified by the pandemic,"" said Ms Shorthouse. 
""And even as we come out of it, online socialising is still going to be popular. 
""It is about making a game into something more - a social space and entertainment venue.""
Writing in Wired, external at the beginning of the year, Mr Baszucki said: ""We will see a shift in the way people play, work, learn or simply hang out in 2021. Some of these connections will move into the Metaverse, a digital place where people seamlessly get together and interact in millions of 3D virtual experiences.""
Massive immersive virtual events will become the norm, he added, and push the boundaries of interactivity, changing the nature of live experiences. 
It is, he writes, ""arguably as big a shift in online communications as the telephone or the internet"". 
Grand plans indeed, and a space that rival gaming platform Fortnite is also determined to get a slice of. 
In September, developer Epic Games announced a three-week-long concert series that took place on the game's Party Royale island.
Nate Nanzer, Fortnite's head of global partnerships, said at the time he hoped it would become a ""tour stop"" for other bands. 
As part of that, Epic built a studio space in Los Angeles, with a large LED wall and floor and remotely operated robocams. The hope for the future is to add mixed and augmented-reality effects to it.
Roblox has been hosting its own parties - in November American rapper Lil Nas performed a virtual concern which was attended 33 million times - and the firm held an event for its own staff at Christmas, complete with nightclub and bar.
Despite the experimentation, Ms Shorthouse thinks gaming will remain at its core.
""It is so strong in that space and a lot of people have stakes in it, with developers making a lot of money.""

"Video game movies: Are they really that bad?","https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-56285471","Sat, 13 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","What do you think is the best video game movie of all time?
Millions of people have been watching the trailer for a new film based on the Mortal Kombat video game series, external. 
The gruesome teaser has got gamers across the world excited about the return of the franchise to the silver screen.
But not all video game movies get such positive attention. The BBC Sounds Press X to Continue podcast has been digging in to the best and worst.
""There are so many video game adaptations that you think are going to be amazing before they come out,"" says Gav Murphy, from RKG Video.
""I was like, 'Assassin's Creed is going to be incredible when it comes out' - and it's just boring. It's joyless.""
The latest Press X to Continue podcast is all about movie adaptations of video games
Game reviewer and Twitch streamer, Inel Tomlinson, on the other hand, took issue with a listener who wanted to rank Doom as the worst video game adaptation.
""Are you trying to tell me Doom is worse than Dead or Alive?
""It's very fanservice-y,"" he says of the Dead or Alive movie. ""The stuff that you get in the game… well, you're getting it in the movie.""

The new Mortal Kombat movie will be the latest in a string of movie adaptations based on fighting games.
That's ""kind of weird"" according to Gav.
""I know there's a lot of fighting game fans out there, but I don't think any of them would say that they play Street Fighter and Tekken for the story,"" he says.
The latest version of Mortal Kombat is coming to the silver screen in April - will it live up to the hype?
Ali Plumb, Radio 1's film critic, thinks the capacity to create convincing special effects may make all the difference to filmmakers taking video games to the big screen.
""When you make a Mortal Kombat movie right now, the cost of visual special effects is a lot less,"" he says. 
""The simplicity of making good-ish or good-enough special effects is there. In 1997 (when earlier versions were released) it was not. 
""So I think right now is the time for a Mortal Kombat film, because it can keep up with what it needs to do.""
As for the best of the bunch? The recent Sonic the Hedgehog movie has to be in the mix according to Ali.
""It's a good little film. It's not perfect, but I think it's a surprisingly large amount of fun. 
""Does it really have a plot? Not so much. Does it make any sense? Nah. But I can totally see my God kid loving this movie.""
A Sonic the Hedgehog movie sequel is in the works
Another video game movie adaptation getting the thumbs up is horror Silent Hill.
""I think it tried to do what the game does, which is an imposing sense of dread,"" says Gav.
Inel insists family-favourite Detective Pikachu is also ""way better than it should be"".
And of course, some of the very worst offenders become enjoyable for all the wrong reasons.
""When it comes to these kind of game films, I enjoy them for how bad they are,"" he laughs.
""I've got two words for these films,"" adds Ali.
""It's terrible and brilliant. So it's terra-brilliant. 
""It's appalling but I can't stop watching.""

"So you want a career in building computer games?","https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56320899","Mon, 15 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","Stephanie Bazeley, co-founder of Team Junkfish
Stephanie Bazeley is living the dream of many who want a career in building computer games.
In 2013, Stephanie and nine other university friends made Monstrum, a survival horror game, in their Dundee living room.
The Abertay University graduates dreamed up, drew, and coded the story while crammed around a desk that ran halfway into a hallway. 
Their efforts won them awards and impressed an angel investor who backed the game with £250,000. 
That was a big deal as they knew they would have a regular salary after graduating.
""Our pay was minimum wage, but compared to living off your student loan, it was still like, 'Aw yeah, I'm getting take-out tonight!'"" Stephanie says. 
Without the extra cash from the investor, her game would have been half the size, and her team, like most indie games makers, would have needed to take on day jobs to pay the bills, while coding through nights and weekends in pursuit of their dream. 
""People underestimate how much money it takes to make a game,"" she says.
Instead, they were able to release Monstrum in 2015. That coincided with the rise of pro-gamers on YouTube and Twitch. Famous online personalities including PewDiePie, Dashie and Markiplier championed Monstrum. 
Monstrum emerged from a university project
Today, the company has grown to 16, calls itself Team Junkfish, and is in the testing phase for Monstrum 2. 
The employees still have to ""wear all the hats"", including PR and overseeing quality testing, says Stephanie. 
From time to time she will receive an offer from larger games companies for a £60,000 developer job but she turns them down. 
""I don't know if my heart would be in it as much as I like making my own game with my friends. And it's a team, and the dream that we believe in,"" says Stephanie. 
Team Junkfish formed on the Professional Project module at Abertay taught by Iain Donald, who continued to mentor them after they graduated. 
""I think Abertay owes a lot of its reputation to Iain,"" says Stephanie. 
The UK's oldest university programme for video game hopefuls, Abertay has built a reputation that attracts students from across the country and around the world.
Modules are offered in computer arts, game applications development, computing, cyber-security, hacking, and game design and production.

The first two years are spent learning core skills and then the focus changes to building a portfolio. 
In their fourth year, students from different disciplines are put into teams of between eight and 10 in order to make a game based on industry contact feedback. 
Normally, the games would showcase at an event in mid-May. This year there will be an online show in early June. 
Technical competence is the baseline for an Abertay grad, but Iain says: ""We try to instil in our graduates that they have to have the soft skills to go with it.""
He reckons there are about 1,200 entry-level positions available each year but about 15,000 to 20,000 students graduating from video game specific degrees. 
""There's a large pool of people looking for a small number of jobs. What makes people stand out is their portfolio, rather than their degree. And, I say that as an educator.""

Brexit has also changed graduate prospects, he says. Jobs in the European Economic Area may not be as easy to land. 
""To get the experience you need for a US or Canadian company to give you a visa, you needed to work for a few years first. Europe gave our graduates those opportunities,"" says Iain. 
He hopes the meteoric rise in sales and the increasing complexity of video game development will open up more opportunities. 
The value of the global gaming market rose to £120.8bn in 2020. More people are playing and for 10% longer each year, according to Research and Markets, external. 
""One reason the games industry has expanded massively and has needed more creative talent is because the technology has kind of sorted itself out,"" says Adam Procter, the programme leader for undergraduate games design at the Winchester School of Art at the University of Southampton. 
Adam Procter says all students leave his course with a job lined up
Abertay developers like Stephanie learn C++, one of the harder coding languages. 
However, some games are built on top of engines. 
An engine is a program that works like building blocks of code. Rather than write every line, a developer can build a game using chunks that are pre-written.  
""That's to empower people to be creative, and not worry about whether they got the semicolon in the right place,"" says Adam. 
On his Southampton University programme, students studying for a Bachelor of Arts in game design are taught to imagine and bring to life the world of a video game. 
In the first year of the three-year course, they focus on creative problem solving by making lots of game prototypes and creating experiences. 
Last year, when lockdowns lifted, students travelled to London's Barbican to shoot video, draw and record the sound of the space. 
""When you are making a game, whether it be a board game or a video game, you can't build a world if you don't observe the world you're in,"" Adam says. 
There is also a showcase, normally in Winchester and London, but this year it is online. Adam says 100% of his students leave with a job. 
""What the games industry wants is people who are creative, curious, have ideas, and are super passionate about games,"" says Adam. 
His remarks are echoed by Chris van der Kuyl, head of 4J Studios, which brought Minecraft to games consoles. 
Chris van der Kuyl says you need to be a team player to get on in computer games development
""This is a talent-based industry and we're looking for passionate enthusiasm. Standing in a queue in front of you there are thousands of people saying, 'It's my life's ambition to work in video games,'"" says the Dundee-based chairman. 
""If you are not someone who naturally works in a team environment you're probably going to find it quite tough,"" he adds. 
While Chris agrees that the technology has become more accessible to those who do not have computer science degrees, he says that everyone has to lean into the tech. 
""A lot of games engineering is about graphics and graphics performance and sometimes physics. Every one of these things requires tough maths,"" he says. 
Programmers interviewing at any games business can expect to be given a test problem to go and solve and then the candidate must walk the interviewers through how they solved it. 
""You're not going to have someone playing in the realm of Premier League football who's got great knowledge of the game and great ideas but who can't control the ball and doesn't have the fitness level to last for a 90-minute game,"" says Chris. 
He advises those who have caught the gaming bug to take the traditional route and specialise at university but also acknowledges there is room for alternative paths - such as the one taken by the creator of Minecraft, Markus ""Notch"" Persson, an excellent software engineer but one who wanted to produce and release his game independently. 
""You know, they might look at someone like Markus and say, 'That's me!' without realising it took him nearly 20 years and 20 games that didn't work before Minecraft happened,"" he says. 
Stephanie Bazeley says passion is what keeps her going and if a person really wants to be in video games, all they need is heart. 
""Just don't give up. If you believe in it, make it and just make sure you get out there,"" she says.

"Valve abandons Artifact card game despite promised reboot","https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56294792","Fri, 05 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","Video games giant Valve has abandoned an attempt to rescue its Artifact game, after months of trying to fix its flaws.
The much-hyped digital card game was released in 2018 but received poor reviews, so Valve announced it would rework the entire game.
But on Thursday, the company said it had abandoned the project entirely.
Instead, the uncompleted work will be published for free to those interested to see how it turned out.
Valve said the ""core gameplay"" of its reworking had been completed, and it had rebranded the updated game as Artifact Foundry. 
It has been made available for free on the Steam store alongside the original version, which has been renamed Artifact Classic. 
But there will be no further updates for either version.
The company admitted the second version of the game ""technically remains an unfinished product"", but characterised the missing elements as ""polish"".
It is the latest in a string of video games to be abandoned, despite developers promising fans a major update.
Anthem, a huge investment from veteran game-maker Bioware, had promised gamers a complete rework after its troubled launch - but the plug was officially pulled on the project last month. 
And Amazon's first major attempt at game publishing ended in disaster, when it ""un-released"" the shooter Crucible. It also promised major changes, before abandoning the game in October.
Valve is seen as a titan in the gaming industry. It rarely releases new games, but when it does they are usually very successful.

The studio is best-known for games such as Counter-Strike and the Half-Life series, which recently got its first title in 13 years.
Reviews of Half-Life: Alyx said the virtual-reality title was revolutionary, and a sign of what VR could accomplish as a medium.
Valve's long gaps between new games is possible, in part, because the company owns and operates the Steam digital games marketplace.
Steam is the most popular PC gaming storefront worldwide, and is Valve's main source of revenue.
The company has also dabbled in PC hardware, from streaming devices to controllers, and has recently focused on its own-brand virtual reality headsets.

"Fall Guys bought by Fortnite maker Epic Games","https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56267423","Wed, 03 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","The British video game company behind 2020's smash hit Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout has been bought by Epic Games.
Mediatonic was founded by two students at Brunel University, and has offices in London, Brighton, and Madrid.
The company said being bought by the maker of Fortnite was ""a huge win for Fall Guys"" and other games. 
Epic said recently announced versions of Fall Guys for Xbox and Nintendo Switch would go ahead as planned.
Fall Guys was released in mid-2020 and quickly became a hit, with millions of players navigating its crazy-golf-style obstacle courses with their colourful ""jellybean"" characters in a chaotic battle royale.
Epic previously bought another hugely popular online title, Rocket League, and turned it into a free game with enhanced cosmetics that could be bought. Like Fall Guys and Epic's own Fortnite, it uses a ""battle pass"" system under which players can buy a premium rewards ticket a few times a year to unlock benefits.
Mediatonic referred to Rocket League's success in a blog post about the purchase, writing that ""Fortnite and Rocket League already have tons of features we'd love to bring to Fall Guys [such as] account systems, cross-play and squad versus squad modes"".
But there was ""nothing to announce right now"" about whether the game would move to a free-to-play model, it said.
""I expect Epic Games to handle Fall Guys in the same way as Rocket League: get the game on major platforms, enable cross-play and when its sales reach the 'ceiling'... ultimately go free-to-play in order to maximise its audience,"" said George Jijiashvili, a games analyst at Omdia.
And Epic's experience in keeping a game stable for a huge number of users would be valuable, he added.

But he also said the planned mobile version of the game, set for release in China, might have its prospects hurt.
""It's unclear if Mediatonic had plans of releasing a mobile version of Fall Guys outside of China, but if they did, the Epic Games acquisition is bound to complicate the matters, given the ongoing Epic Games legal battle with Apple.""
Dave Bailey, one of the former university students who founded the studio in 2005, said ""with Epic, we feel like we have found a home that was made for us. They share our mission to build and support games that have a positive impact, empower others and stand the test of time"".
Epic Games' founder and chief Tim Sweeney was a little more cryptic, saying: ""It's no secret that Epic is invested in building the Metaverse, and Tonic Games shares this goal.""
In science fiction, the Metaverse is the idea of a virtual reality beyond our own, a shared digital space that is bigger than any one game. Fortnite's experiments in concerts and multimedia are sometimes seen as a step in that direction.
""As Epic works to build this virtual future, we need great creative talent who know how to build powerful games, content and experiences,"" Mr Sweeney said.
