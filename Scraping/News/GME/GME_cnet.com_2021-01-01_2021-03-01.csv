    Keith Gill, who made millions off a surprise jump in GameStop stock, is increasingly under the spotlight. He insists he did nothing wrong.
  
GameStop stock swung wildly after Keith Gill started hyping its prospects.
Keith Gill goes by several names online, including Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepFuckingValue on Reddit. Now he'll be adding defendant to the list. Law firm Hagens Berman filed a class action suit on Tuesday against Gill, accusing him of exaggerated claims, misrepresented posts and other similar behavior as he helped kick off a market frenzy over GameStop's shares. At one point, enthusiasm for the stock pushed the struggling retailer's shares up more than 2,700% from the beginning of the year. In the process, Gill was said to have netted more than $30 million.
""In order to motivate amateur traders, Gill fashioned himself as a kind of Robin Hood and characterized securities professionals as villains,"" says the lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of plaintiff Christian  Iovin, who participated in the drama. ""Gill's  deceitful  and  manipulative  conduct  not  only  violated  numerous  industry regulations and rules, but also various securities laws by undermining the integrity of the market for GameStop shares.""
The suit is seeking punitive damages. Gill didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The suit isn't the only thing Gill's facing this week. On Thursday, he and other people at the center of the GameStop stock drama will participate in a hearing held by the US House Committee on Financial Services. The hearing, called ""Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide,"" is seeking an explanation for the stock volatility. The chief executives of social network Reddit, stock trading app Robinhood, and funds Citadel and Melvin Capital are also confirmed to attend. CNET will be streaming the hearing on our YouTube channel when it begins around 9 a.m. PT/noon ET.
One question facing Congress is whether any bad behavior happened as the stock's price swung wildly. Reddit users are accusing hedge funds and Robinhood of attempting to manipulate the stock market, shutting off trading of GameStop's shares as they began falling from their peak of about $483.
As for Gill, in written hearing testimony posted Wednesday, he insisted he acted properly.
""I did not solicit anyone to buy or sell the stock for my own profit,"" he said. ""I did not belong to any groups trying to create movements in the stock price.  I never had a financial relationship with any hedge fund.  I had no information about GameStop except what was public.  I did not know any people inside the company, and I never spoke to any insider.""
And though the company's share price has fallen, Gill said he still believes it's undervalued, closing his testimony with an internet meme: ""In short, I like the  stock."""
"Reddit's WallStreetBets had a dramatic Wednesday evening","https://www.cnet.com/culture/reddits-wallstreetbets-is-back-taking-on-gamestop-stock-after-intentional-lockdown/","Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","CNET","
    But the community has been banned from Discord as AMC, GameStop stocks go wild.
  
One of Reddit's most active communities is no longer public.
For the past week, Reddit's r/WallStreetBets community has been the center of an epic war between large Wall Street investors and small-scale social media betters. On Wednesday evening, the community reeled from seeing the subreddit locked and hidden, only to be made public again about an hour later. Meanwhile, chat app Discord has banned WallStreetBets outright. 
Around the same time, spooked investors appeared to dump GameStop and AMC shares the community had been buying up to take on people betting against the company's futures. 
Then, as suddenly as everything began, the subreddit came back, a new Discord community was formed, and others bought in to the stocks, sending AMC and GameStop prices back up.
OK.
If all this is confusing, don't feel bad. These fast and dramatic moves are happening amid one of the most dramatic weeks on Wall Street in years. At stake are millions of dollars that small-time investors working together on social media have made while taking on Wall Street investors who bet GameStop and AMC stock would plummet. Instead, as the two company's stocks have soared, the Wall Street investors have reportedly hemorrhaged billions of dollars.
As the drama unfolded from the Discord ban and the Reddit community going on lockdown, GameStop shares fell 32% in after-hours trading late Wednesday, to $218.32 per share, down from $347.51 at their close. During the day, they'd more than doubled. AMC shares also fell, dropping more than 40%, to $11.90 per share, after closing at $19.90. That stock had risen more than 301% during the day.
Both stocks have recovered somewhat, and the r/WallStreetBets community is back. If you'd taken an hour and a half to watch Pixar's new movie, Soul, you'd have missed it.
Though GameStop shares have been jumping in recent days, analysts and experts say they're doing so because of quirks in the market and not because of actual increased value for the struggling video game retailer. The same is true for the movie theater chain AMC, which had warned it was near bankruptcy late last year.
All this wasn't the only bad news for the WallStreetBets community. Its worst community members, who repeatedly broke Discord's rules, caused the group to be banned from the platform, the chat app company said in a statement. ""Today, we decided to remove the server and its owner from Discord for  continuing to allow hateful and discriminatory content after repeated  warnings,"" Discord said. It added that the ban had nothing to do with any talk of finances or stock that happened among WallStreetBets users.
Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla who's helped to drive attention to the GameStop stock madness, tweeted his disappointment with Discord Wednesday.

    Investors organizing on social media hit multimillion-dollar paydays as they fought Wall Street over GameStop's share price. Experts say it can't last.
  
GameStop shares are on an epic roller coaster that pushed them to the stratosphere. But for how long?
Many of today's adults spent their youths in 
  GameStop
 stores. They lined up for console launches. They bought and sold games there, too. Now some of those gamers are rich after buying GameStock's stock and encouraging their friends on 
  Reddit
 to buy it too. GameStop's shares rocketed higher than ever expected in the past couple weeks, and all because activity among social media investors began pushing it up. Wall Street had bet heavily that the company would fail, but as the price kept going up, investors were forced to reset their wagers. That led the stock to rocket up, and then swing wildly.
And though the share price dipped on Monday, Feb. 1, by more than 30%, many Reddit users say they're buying more GameStop stock, convinced it'll rocket even higher.
Jaime Rogozinski, the apparent founder of the Reddit community at the heart of all this, told The Wall Street Journal it's like ""a train wreck happening in real time."" Keith Gill, the trader in the Reddit community who helped kick off the battle, told the paper he ""didn't expect this.""
Last week, on Thursday alone, GameStop's stock hit all-time highs of $492.02 per share, only to drop by more than half a minute later. It closed trading at $325 the next day.
GameStop itself hasn't fundamentally changed in the past month. It's still a struggling retailer facing an uncertain future against the rising tide of online shopping. But its stock has shot up as much as 1,800% -- that's not a typo -- since the beginning of the year. This dynamic's led Wall Street investors who bet against the company's future to lose billions of dollars, and the excitement is driving the hype even further.
Over the past couple weeks, the financial world watched in shock as GameStop stock (or ""stonk"" as the reddit community calls it) rose to unthinkable levels. Even Elon Musk tweeted about it, pointing his 43 million followers to a link of the Reddit community investing in GameStop, called r/WallStreetBets.
By the close of regular trading on Wednesday, Jan. 27, the stock was $347.51 per share, up from from historic lows of around $3.30 per share in the summer of 2019. And then in after-hours trading, it dropped by more than 37%, only to rise again. The next day saw even more dramatic moves, with the stock jumping up to $492.02 before dropping nearly 60% to close at $197.44. Then, in after-hours trading, it rose back up to $311.99.
Meanwhile, stock market trading apps appeared to either stop or impose restrictions on GameStop share purchasing for at least part of the day. 
The popular stock trading app Robinhood drew particular attention for what appeared to be the among the most restrictive new rules. People had been raising concerns about Robinhood for a while, saying it ""gamified"" stock trading to a potentially dangerous degree. Now it's being accused of outright market manipulation, including through at least one class action lawsuit filed already. Robinhood, for its part, said last week that market rules effectively forced it to put those restrictions in place.

""We're seeing a phenomenon that I have never seen,"" Jim Cramer, a Wall Street commentator on CNBC and a former hedge fund manager, said during a segment as shares were first beginning to swing. And GameStop could be just the start. ""It's insane.""
This may seem like an oddball story about Wall Street investors being overrun by excited social media users. For some, it's been fun to watch those investors get taken to the cleaners by a bunch of people posting rocket emojis, saying GameStop shares will go ""to the moon.""
Reddit users are betting they can take GameStop shares ""to the moon.""
But for some on Wall Street, it's the latest sign of how social media can upend everyday life. Twitter has changed the worlds of news and politics. YouTube and Instagram have transformed the fashion, beauty and entertainment industries. Now Reddit is taking on Wall Street.
These worlds have overlapped as well. Fans of Korean pop groups, known as K-pop stans, post floods of tweets about their favorite stars to overwhelm racist hashtags on Twitter. And TikTokers banded together in attempts to confuse President Donald Trump's reelection campaign.
Now emboldened Reddit communities are talking about taking on other companies that Wall Street is broadly betting against. The Reddit crowd is already attempting to push up BlackBerry, the once-popular handset maker that now focuses primarily   on selling business software. And Redditors are also targeting the struggling movie chain AMC, pushing its stock from hovering around $2 per share to more than $8 in after-hours trading. By Wednesday, Jan. 27, it closed at $19.90 per share before dropping to $12.75. The next day, it fell even further, to $8.63 per share.
The Reddit community's actions have had such an impact that TD Ameritrade took the extraordinary step last week to limit share trading on Game Stop and AMC stocks, ""out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions."" Nasdaq as well warned that it will halt trading on stocks it thinks are being manipulated by social media.
Meantime, traffic to the Reddit community at the center of the drama, r/WallStreetBets, is breaking records. Mashable reported that r/WallStreetBets counted 73 million page views for its discussion boards on Tuesday, Jan. 26, as stocks began to swing. Over a seven day span, it hit about 700 million page views. Reddit is already the 46th most popular site on the web, notching more than 78 million unique visitors in December, according to comScore. And on Wednesday, Jan. 27, Reddit's mobile app tallied its biggest single day of downloads, industry watcher Apptopia said.
The whole drama's even caught the attention of Saturday Night Live, which lampooned the Reddit investors as the latest sign Wall Street isn't working.
But when the memes stop and the excitement goes away, GameStop will go back to being that struggling video game retailer at a time when gaming is increasingly moving toward streaming and the idea of stepping into a physical store is still a nerve-wracking prospect during a pandemic. At that point, stock analysts say, whoever's left holding shares will see their value evaporate.
""This is unnatural, insane and dangerous,"" Michael Burry, a prominent GameStop investor and one of the subjects of the book and movie The Big Short, wrote in a now-deleted tweet. His roughly $17 million investment in the company ballooned to at least $250 million last week, give or take a few swings in the share price, Markets Insider reported.
Many gamers spent their childhoods going to GameStop.
Michael Pachter, a longtime video game industry analyst at Wedbush Securities, said he hasn't even bothered to update his stock price expectations for GameStop since shares started going crazy. ""Who's listening?"" he said in an interview last week. ""Nobody cares what a sell-side analyst says right now.""
To him, there are reasonable explanations why people could be somewhat excited about GameStop. One of its newest board members, Ryan Cohen, helped turn Chewy into one of the largest online pet product sellers in the world, before selling it to PetSmart. GameStop's also on a track to being profitable again.
But that doesn't come close to explaining GameStop's share price now. ""It's a Ponzi scheme,"" Pachter said, referring to a form of fraud that appears to make money but in fact is only propped up by funding from new investors. ""There is a point where it'll go down.""
Many of the Reddit users buying up GameStop shares see this as a way to fight Wall Street greed.
He suspects that may happen after the company reports its quarterly results in March, at which point executives and investors on the board are allowed to sell their shares.
In the meantime, industry watchers are attempting to understand what forces are at play in the drama, and what these swings say about the economy.
""When you see what's happening with GameStop, you ask yourself, is this  manipulation, is this mass psychosis or is there something wrong in our  market structure that is causing this to happen,"" James Angel, a  finance professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of  Business, told the New York Times.
One thing analysts watching wonder is whether the Reddit investors will lose their millions whenever the stock eventually crashes back to earth. Rogozinski, the man who helped found the Reddit community, said their approach to investing as more like gambling than traditional analysis and strategy. Its members, who the community identifies as ""degenerates,"" often encourage one another to push all their funds into one stock, riding it up and down. Their posts are punctuated with phrases like ""hold the line"" and ""diamond hands"" (hold onto your stocks for a long time) and YOLO (you only live once).
He told the WSJ he never imagined the Reddit community would morph from its beginnings to what it's become. ""It's a little like watching one of those horror films where you can see the bad guy slowly going up the stairs,"" Rogozinski           said.
Indeed, even Keith Gill, the community member who helped kickstart the initial battle over GameStop, told the Journal he was surprised by what it'd turned into.
""I thought this trade would be successful,"" he said, ""but I never expected what happened over the past week.""
In the meantime, the social media hype is continuing on Reddit, where users are declaring their intention to buy and hold more GameStop shares, all to send prices even higher.
""My mom told me it's time to sell,"" one Reddit user wrote on a post about GameStop's stock moves. ""Should I find a new mom?""
""Yes,"" another user answered. ""The answer is yes.""

"GameStop stock run gives it a bigger market cap than several actual video game companies","https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/gamestop-stock-run-gives-it-a-bigger-market-cap-than-several-actual-video-game-companies-gme/","Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","CNET","
    Watch out Take-Two.
  
GameStop shares are running hot right now.
GameStop's massive run on Wall Street this month hasn't just given nice profits to members of the WallStreetBets Reddit board, it's also made the retailer bigger than some of the video game companies whose products it sells. 
The run, which has seen GameStop stock soar from under $17.25 a share at the start of the year to nearly $400 a share early Thursday, gives the beleaguered video game retailer a market cap of roughly $28 billion. This puts GameStop ahead of firms such as Take-Two Interactive, Ubisoft and Square Enix. 
Take-Two, which owns Grand Theft Auto publisher Rockstar Games as well as 2K (makers of the popular NBA 2K franchise) was valued Thursday morning at $23.07 billion. France-based Ubisoft, which owns the Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs franchises, was valued at $12.39 billion, and Japan-based Square Enix, maker of Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts, at $6.95 billion. 
Despite the massive run, GameStop still has a ways to go to catch top game publishers Activision Blizzard ($70.32 billion market cap), EA ($41.97 billion) and hardware makers Nintendo ($72.1 billion), Sony ($123.54 billion) and Microsoft ($1.8 trillion). 
Whether the company can sustain its improbable run, of course, remains the multibillion-dollar question. TD Ameritrade has restricted some trading of GameStop stock, as well as other stocks mentioned by the Reddit board including movie theater chain AMC. Robinhood joined the blocking on Thursday morning. The company explained its decision in a blog post, saying that ""in light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only."" It proceeded to list a number of companies popular on Reddit including GameStop, AMC, Express and Nokia. 
The volatility also hasn't always worked in the stocks' favor. GameStop stock was down over 30% at times in after-hours trading on Wednesday, but the stock's fans seem to have rallied in the face of apparent pressure from Robinhood and TD Ameritrade. GameStop stock was up over 10% in early trading, with people getting topics like ""DO NOT SELL"" to trend on Twitter in the US while advising others to use apps such as Webull and the Cash App's Investing option to trade securities.

"My kids can't stop playing terrible video games","https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/my-kids-cant-stop-playing-terrible-video-games/","Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","CNET","
    Commentary: Can't they just like what I like?
  
Among Us is probably as good as it gets.
A couple of months ago, I asked my 7-year-old son which 
  video games
 he wanted for Christmas. The list he handed back made for depressing reading.
At the top, of course: Among Us. 
A video game version of social deduction games like Mafia or Werewolf, Among Us is so popular it threatens to swallow up all other forms of entertainment -- movies, TV, 
  toys
, everything -- like a snack-size bag of Skittles.
Second was Roblox, a weird set of creation tools kids mostly use to create, upload and then play with an endless list of grim video game ripoffs. Watching any child play Roblox is a fast-track to insanity. Brain worms in their purest form.
Third on the list: a game called ""Zooba."" Zooba? What on God's green earth is Zooba? 
Good question. 
Still not sure what this is.
A cursory Google search says Zooba is a free-for-all battle royale combat game where animals fight to the death. But until my son clumsily spelled it out on a purple Post-it note, I'd literally never heard of Zooba. I still only have a rudimentary idea what the hell it is. And, to be honest, I'm not sure I want to delve deeper into that rabbit hole.
Kids -- mainly my kids -- have terrible, terrible taste in video games.
As a journalist who's spent the majority of his career covering video games, my home is a treasure trove that most adults, let alone kids, would salivate over. We have a PS5, two 
  Nintendo Switches
, an Xbox Series X and easy access to almost every major video game release, sometimes weeks in advance. 
With practically every classic major release of the last decade at their fingertips, my children choose these strange, bottom-feeder, free-to-play iPad games about doing flips on a BMX. Human Fall Flat, a weird-ass game about… humans falling flat I guess. Who the hell knows? 
Then there's Goat Simulator. 
For a period of two months, my children played nothing but Goat Simulator, a meme game, essentially, that was strange when it was first released seven years ago, in 2014.
They could be playing Mario, or Rayman Legends, or Ori and the Will of the Wisps. They could be playing anything except Goat Simulator!
For about two months my kid was obsessed with this 7-year-old video game.
These choices don't come in a vacuum. Driven by YouTubers and amplified by strange algorithms, they manifest in the evolutionary swamp of the playground, where -- between flossing and dabbing, presumably -- children swap tips on which terrible video games they should torture their parents with next. Kids no longer play tag or hide-and-seek. No, they designate ""imposters"" and play Among Us, before heading home to beg hapless parents to install 
  Fortnite
 on iPads designed for ""homework.""
Later, they might trawl through the App Store, endlessly watching trailers for terrible free-to-play games designed to ruthlessly drain credit cards of their loot. It's a constantly shifting nightmare, and the end result is grim: We have an entire population of children with god-awful taste in video games.
I didn't anticipate this. Once, as a child-free (read: care-free) adult, I always imagined myself being a ""cool dad."" I like new music, I get... stuff, I pass the ""vibe check."" Never in my wildest nightmares did I imagine my precious video games would be the medium that made me feel like an out-of-touch grandad refusing to move with the times, but here we are.
But is this the same thing? Have I become my parents, radio dials glued to classic rock, complaining about hip-hop not being ""real music""? That's definitely part of it. 
People spend a lot of money on this game.
Yet Roblox and [shudder] bloody Zooba aren't Grandmaster Flash and Kool Herc. It's hardly a seismic shift that stubborn middle-aged brains can't adapt to. More like children being collectively and uncritically gazumped by apps and algorithms beyond their understanding. My son doesn't know that free-to-play mechanics are often exploitative. He's seven. He doesn't really understand the difference between a finely crafted experience like Mario Galaxy and Lucky's Tale. He's just happy to have a controller in his hand. 
The kids are all right, I suppose -- and it's my job to steer mine right. I get that. But the tide is strong. The politics and peer pressure of the playground are a heavy weight for any parent to push back against, particularly when boosted by social media and YouTube. But I'm trying. I'm trying my damnedest to teach my kids what a good video game looks like. To foist my own tastes upon them like all good parents should, goddammit.  
The sooner these wee buggers learn to like what I like, the better. That's what being a parent is all about, right?
Right.

"Nintendo Switch games are too expensive but it makes total sense","https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/nintendo-switch-games-are-too-expensive-but-it-makes-total-sense/","Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT","CNET","
    Commentary: Skyward Sword costs $10 more a decade after release. What gives?
  
When The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword launched for the Nintendo Wii back in 2011, the motion-controlled adventure was priced at $49.99. This week, Nintendo announced a remastered version of the game for the Switch: The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD, priced at $59.99, adding a dollar to the price tag for every year that's passed since the original game's release.  
Nintendo fans everywhere let out a quiet sigh of resignation. Skyward Sword, a 10-year-old Wii game, is more expensive than it was when it first came out a decade ago -- and it's going to stay expensive, because first-party Nintendo Switch games almost never get price drops. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, a port of a Nintendo Wii U game that launched in 2017, still sells for full price almost four years later. Super Mario Odyssey does too, as well as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Party, and New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe. 
Everyone dislikes this. In fact, it feels wrong. Nintendo's competitors, like Sony, routinely and permanently drop prices for big-budget AAA games. God of War for PS4 launched in April 2018 for $59.99, but by October the price was permanently lowered to just $39.99. Today, it costs under $20. Marvel's Spider-Man was released that same year and was given a similar $20 price drop in February 2019. Xbox, PlayStation and PC game releases often see big price drops within the first year, or not long after. It feels like an industry standard practice. As buyers, we've come to expect it, and that expectation makes Nintendo's consistently high prices feel jarring. Like Nintendo is being unfair. 
But Nintendo isn't being unfair. It's just following our lead -- because as much as we'd like to pay less for the Nintendo Switch versions of reissued Wii U games, we don't. We pay full price, and continue to pay full price, no matter how old the games are.   As usual, math and economics ruin everything. According to Nintendo's latest fiscal earnings report, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has sold over 33 million copies since launch -- earning Nintendo a potentially staggering windfall. And the game is still a top seller: It's still the fifth-best-selling game on the Nintendo Switch eShop and to this day is Amazon's ninth-best-selling Nintendo Switch game. 
Who doesn't love Mario Kart? 
To put that in perspective, one of the PlayStation 4's best-selling games, God of War, had sold an estimated 12 million copies by June 2019, and is Amazon's 23rd best-selling PS4 game. PlayStation had to cut its price to keep buyers interested in Kratos; meanwhile, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has been selling in record numbers at full price since launch. 
Nintendo games are expensive. Everyone Hates it. And yet Nintendo has no reason to drop prices -- it's selling more copies of its games than its competitors and making more money on each copy sold.  
And, for better or worse, Nintendo fans have gotten used to expensive games. On social media we bitterly joke about the ""Switch tax"" that prices modern ports of older games at a premium. We often try to rationalize those higher prices -- sure, Doom (2016) and The Witcher III: Wild Hunt cost more on Switch, but developers had to rebuild and optimize those games to work on Nintendo's lower-powered hardware. Sometimes, we have to rationalize harder: Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster costs less than $30 on Steam and PS4. The $20 price hike to $49.99 is the devil's deal we make to play it on a portable platform.  
Nintendo has cultivated an expectation of expensive games, and even though we don't like it, we've come to accept it. Consumers have spoken with their wallets, and Nintendo has heard us loud and clear: The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword is worth $59.99, despite being a port of a decade-old Wii game that originally sold for $10 less.   It feels wrong, like Nintendo is being unfair -- but the data doesn't lie. We're going to buy it anyway and, once again, Nintendo will print money.

"Infinity Game Table hands-on: Touchscreen table gives classic board games new spin","https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/infinity-game-table-hands-on-touch-screen-table-gives-classic-board-games-new-spin/","Mon, 11 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","CNET","
    Arcade1Up rolls the dice on a new system for digital tabletop games.
  
The idea behind the Infinity Game Table is pretty simple: Play any board game you want -- but the 
  games
 are digital on a large touchscreen table. No pieces to set up, no cards to shuffle and no one has to be the banker. Just gather the family around and dive in. And the family doesn't have to be in the same home. Table owners can play with each other online.
I got an exclusive chance to check out an early prototype of the system, which you can see in the video embedded above. The company behind it is Arcade1Up, which you may know for its recreations of retro arcade cabinets. Now the team is tinkering with tabletop games, building a digital library of touchscreen versions, starting with Hasbro's most popular titles. 
My husband and I got into a heated battle of Monopoly late into the night while testing a prototype of the 24-inch model of the Infinity Game Table.
Since this year's CES is all digital, the team offered me the opportunity to play its 24-inch screen prototype at my home for a few days. 
The Infinity Game Table found success as a Kickstarter campaign, with backers pledging more than $1 million in support. The first units are expected to start shipping to early supporters by March, and the retail price starts at $600 -- about the cost of a new high-end iPad. 
I got a kick out of how fast my husband and I could jump into a game of Monopoly, and watched the board come to life when little tokens hopped around the board. Digital dice rolls would sometimes still knock over the little homes and hotels on our property. And police sirens wailed when someone was sent to jail -- putting your little token behind bars. 
Sometimes the key feature of a board game is the feel of the physical game elements. There's the clicky spin of the wheel in The Game of Life, the bounce of the bubble in Pop-o-Matic Trouble, or the buzz in Operation. So how does that translate digitally? 
You're only touching an image of the bubble for Trouble, but the entire table does vibrate with each press. And pegs animate as they fly across the game's path.
And in Operation, the game designers turned the tweezer challenge into a maze, dragging your finger across the screen. If you hit the edge, the table rumbles and the patient's heartbeat picks up, building anxiety for your next try.
Tapping a hippo's bum isn't the same as slamming one and seeing balls fly in Hungry Hungry Hippos. So it doesn't always replace the actual board game's appeal for the kiddie titles. But digital versions can open up new ways to play -- not to mention make saving a game easy when you want to pick it up again later.
The table's offerings go beyond Hasbro games. The company is also working on titles such as Pandemic and Ticket to Ride, and the table has plenty of card games and table-top staples like checkers and chess. Arcade1Up wants to open it up to developers to build new game concepts. What if a game's board could change as you play? Or interact with how a player touches the board? 
The potential here is intriguing. You're still sitting across the table, playing friends and family face-to-face, but a screen could be used to get people playing in new ways. The possibilities really depend on what developers bring to the table.

    From declining sales to shuttered stores, the underlying value of this company is still questionable, and stock gains don't change that.
  
GameStop's stock price won't help the stores make more money. 

  GameStop
's stock price soared last week due to a concerted effort by traders on Reddit. The video game retailer's shares grew by more than 14,300%, but they've since plummeted, going from $328 on Friday to a close of $53.50 on Thursday. Fans of the stock continue to hold their GameStop shares to stick it to Wall Street and hedge funds, but don't be fooled, the company isn't doing so hot. 
The share price for GameStop doesn't tell the whole story about the company. Indeed, one of the reasons for its stratospheric gains is that so many institutional investors were betting on it to fail -- to an absurd degree. That type of investing, known as short selling, opened the door to individuals who coordinated their efforts online to drive up the price. 
Stock prices have, at some level, always been disconnected from reality for the average American (just stack 2020's stock market gains against the pandemic-fueled economic collapse), but this GameStop roller coaster ride throws all logic and basic investment principles out the window. To those on the WallStreetBets subreddit, that's the point. 
Lost in all the hoopla is that GameStop continues to falter when it comes to all the important metrics for a company, with declining 
  sales
 and the closing of 462 stores last year. Let's take a look at how GameStop is performing as an actual business, and not just as the 
  target
 of some enthusiastic individual investors. 
Not that great. According to its fiscal third-quarter 
  earnings


Meanwhile, digital sales for 
  games
 reached new heights. Major publishers such as 
  Sony
, 
  EA
 and Take-Two reported that digital purchases surpassed physical sales in 2020, according to Daniel Ahmad, an analyst at Niko Partners. Microsoft's Game Pass, which lets gamers access more than 100 games for $15 a month, hit 18 million subscribers, CEO Satya Nadella said on the company's second-quarter earnings conference call. 
EA said that 52% of its console full game unit sales in the past 12 months were via digital downloadFor reference, Take Two says its ratio was 55% for FY2020Sony said that 51% of all games sold on PS4 in FY2020 were digitalIn other words. We enter next gen with digital >50%
Cloud gaming also grew in 2020. Microsoft's xCloud and Nvidia's Geforce Now launched last year, following Google's Stadia service, which came out in late 2019. These services let players stream games without the need for physical copies of games or even 
  consoles
.
In September 2019, GameStop CEO George Sherman tried to get gamers back into stores by turning a few test stores into hangouts for customers. But the company closed 462 stores in 2020, with plans to shutter more than 1,000 stores total by March. It still has more than 5,000 stores in the US. 
On Dec. 1, GameStop's stock price was $15.80 a share, which gave it a market value of slightly more than $1 billion. As of Friday, the retailer's shares were trading at $325 apiece, valuing the company at more than $22 billion. That put it at No. 464 on the Fortune 500 list, right behind video game publisher Activision Blizzard. The jump in stock price vaulted the value of GameStop over that of game publishers Ubisoft, Take-Two and Square Enix. Thursday saw the shares continue their fall to $53.50, making the market cap for the retailer at approximately $3.7 billion.
Though the retailer struggled in recent years, it wasn't at death's door. 
""I actually think they are in a good position to grow revenue and earnings again with the console launches,"" said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter. ""Earnings power like that supports a price in the high teens or low 20s.""
Pachter has GameStop's stock at a target price of $16. Keep in mind this is just one analyst's assessment.
The retailer did receive some help in recent months thanks to the release of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles. Both are still in high demand and selling out swiftly whenever they're in stock. GameStop reported $1.7 billion in sales this past holiday season. Online sales made up 34% of the total holiday sales, which was a 300% increase from the previous year.   
GameStop said it will bring on Matt Francis, an engineering leader at Amazon Web Service, to be the company's first chief technology officer, according to a report from Marketwatch on Wednesday. He will oversee GameStop's e-commerce operations when he starts on Feb. 15. 
What's important to know is that GameStop's inflated prices don't equate to financial success. It still has problems that need to be addressed.
Remember that while deciding whether this is a roller coaster you'd want to brave."
"Panasonic's new HUD tech turns your windshield into a video game","https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/panasonic-hud-tech-windshield-video-game/","Wed, 13 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","CNET","
    This looks like a user interface for a racing game, and that's awesome.
  
This looks great.
I love a good head-up display, but today's HUDs have their shortcomings. You'd think with the latest technology, companies would already have something to add even more information to a windshield. Lots do, but 
  Panasonic's
 seems mighty realistic and nearly ready for prime time.
The company revealed its latest HUD system complete with artificial intelligence and augmented reality tech at a virtual CES 2021 event. It aims to go beyond a standard HUD, which often simply displays speed and a couple other nuggets of information. Panasonic's idea is to essentially turn a windshield into a video game user interface. I like that.
The sample photo shows the technology at work with a guidance route for navigation, detection for a cyclist, speed, a measurement for an underpass and the street's speed limit. Yes, some of these basic things are available with today's HUDs, but the way it's all integrated is pleasing. The less time looking at other screens in a car the better; HUDs keep your eyes forward and on the road.
Panasonic said the company used its latest technology, from advances in optics, volume optimization and imaging technology, to create the comprehensive system. AI systems also work to detect cyclists or pedestrians, for example, and clearly mark them for drivers. Everything updates constantly at 300 milliseconds per refresh and eye tracking ensures information displays at the driver's eye level without fuss. The firm also said the system is compact so it will fit any vehicle package, should automakers want to include the system with their vehicles. I hope they do.
Like all of the company's latest tech shown at CES this year, it's not for individual sale. Instead, you may find this HUD, and its nifty wireless phone charger with a moving coil, in a car coming to you very soon."

Read the background: Robinhood backlash: Here's what you should know about the GameStop stock controversy
More witnesses may be called, Waters, the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, said Friday.
""We'll have the young man from Reddit, his name is Keith Gill, who basically started this mania,"" Waters said on Feb. 3 when announcing the hearing. ""We're going to make sure that we're not taking sides.""
The hearing comes after Reddit's WallStreetBets community banded together and used Robinhood and other financial services apps to push GameStop stocks 14,000% higher over the last few months after Wall Street hedge funds bet against those shares. 
Robinhood then restricted trading of GameStop stock citing ""market volatility,"" but after a lawsuit seeking class-action status was quickly filed against Robinhood was filed in New York. Robinhood changed course later the same day, restoring ""limited buys of these securities."""
