"Pope Francis appoints first woman to the Synod of Bishops","https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55966178","Sat, 06 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","Sister Nathalie Becquart takes a seat among Vatican bishops
The Pope has appointed a woman as an undersecretary to the Synod of Bishops for the first time.
Sister Nathalie Becquart, who is from France, will have voting rights in the body, which advises the pontiff and debates some of the most controversial issues in the Roman Catholic Church.
Ms Becquart has worked with the synod as a consultant since 2019.
The body's secretary-general, Cardinal Mario Grech, said the appointment showed that ""a door has opened"".
He noted that the decision reflects the Pope's desire ""for a greater participation of women in the process of discernment and decision-making in the church"".

The BBC's John McManus says the move is not a precursor to ordaining women as priests, although some opponents may regard it as a further step in that direction.

Luis Marín de San Martín, a priest from Spain, was also named as a new undersecretary of the synod.
In recent years, the Synod of Bishops has debated topics of doctrine including the treatment of divorced and married Catholics.

The news comes less than a month after Pope Francis formally changed the law in the Church to allow women to administer communion and serve at the altar, although the decree stressed that ordained priesthood would remain open to men only.
Last year, meanwhile, the pontiff appointed six women to the council which oversees the Vatican's finances.

Few characters in literature or indeed life embody an era quite so tenaciously as Jay Gatsby does the Jazz Age. Almost a century after he was written into being, F Scott Fitzgerald's doomed romantic has become shorthand for decadent flappers, champagne fountains and never-ending parties. Cut loose by pop culture from the text into which he was born, his name adorns everything from condominiums to hair wax and a limited-edition cologne (it contains notes of vetiver, pink pepper and Sicilian lime). It's now possible to lounge on a Gatsby sofa, check in at the Gatsby hotel, even chow down on a Gatsby sandwich – essentially a supersize, souped-up chip butty.

-       The most joyful books ever written

Incongruous though that last item sounds, naming anything after the man formerly known as James Gatz seems more than a touch problematic. After all, flamboyant host is just one part of his complicated identity. He's also a bootlegger, up to his neck in criminal enterprise, not to mention a delusional stalker whose showmanship comes to seem downright tacky. If he embodies the potential of the American Dream, then he also illustrates its limitations: here is a man, let's not forget, whose end is destined to be as pointless as it is violent.
Misunderstanding has been a part of The Great Gatsby's story from the very start. Grumbling to his friend Edmund Wilson shortly after publication in 1925, Fitzgerald declared that ""of all the reviews, even the most enthusiastic, not one had the slightest idea what the book was about."" Fellow writers like Edith Wharton admired it plenty, but as the critic Maureen Corrigan relates in her book So We Read On: How The Great Gatsby Came to Be and Why It Endures, popular reviewers read it as crime fiction, and were decidedly underwhelmed by it at that. Fitzgerald's Latest A Dud, ran a headline in the New York World. The novel achieved only so-so sales, and by the time of the author's death in 1940, copies of a very modest second print run had long since been remaindered.
The novel has become a force in pop culture, helped by Hollywood; the term 'Gatsbyesque' emerged a few years after the 1974 film starring Robert Redford (Credit: Getty Images)
Gatsby's luck began to change when it was selected as a giveaway by the US military. With World War Two drawing to a close, almost 155,000 copies were distributed in a special Armed Services Edition, creating a new readership overnight. As the 1950s dawned, the flourishing of the American Dream quickened the novel's topicality, and by the 1960s, it was enshrined as a set text. It's since become such a potent force in pop culture that even those who've never read it feel as if they have, helped along, of course, by Hollywood. It was in 1977, just a few short years after Robert Redford starred in the title role of an adaptation scripted by Francis Ford Coppola, that the word Gatsbyesque was first recorded.
Along with Baz Luhrmann's divisive 2013 movie extravaganza, the book has in the past decade alone spawned graphic novels, a musical, and an immersive theatrical experience. From now on, we're likely to be seeing even more such adaptations and homages because at the start of this year, the novel's copyright expired, enabling anyone to adapt it without permission from its estate . Early calls for a Muppets adaptation may have come to nothing (never say never), but a big-budget TV miniseries is already in the works, and author Min Jin Lee and cultural critic Wesley Morris are both writing fresh introductions to new editions.

If this all leaves Fitzgerald purists twiddling their pearls like worry beads, it's quite possible that while some such projects may further perpetuate the myth that throwing a Gatsby-themed party could be anything other than sublimely clueless, others may yield fresh insights into a text whose very familiarity often leads us to skate over its complexities. Take, for instance, Michael Farris Smith's new novel, Nick. The title refers, of course, to Nick Carraway, the narrator of Gatsby, who here gets his own fully formed backstory. It's the tale of a Midwesterner who goes off to Europe to fight in World War One and comes back changed, as much by a whirlwind love affair in Paris as by trench warfare. There's room for an impulsive sojourn in the New Orleans underworld before he heads off to Long Island's West Egg.
An impossible dream?
Like many, Smith first encountered the novel in high school. ""I just completely didn’t get it"", he tells BBC Culture, from his home in Oxford, Mississippi. ""They seemed like a lot of people complaining about things they really shouldn't be complaining about."" It was only when he picked it up again while living abroad in his late twenties that he began to understand the novel's power. ""It was a very surreal reading experience for me. It seemed like something on almost every page was speaking to me in a way I had not expected,"" he recalls.
Reaching the scene in which Carraway suddenly remembers it's his thirtieth birthday, Smith was filled with questions about what kind of a person Gatsby's narrator really was. ""It seemed to me that there had been some real trauma that had made him so detached, even from his own self. The thought crossed my mind that it would be really interesting if someone were to write Nick's story,"" he says. In 2014, by then a published author in his forties, he sat down to do just that, telling neither his agent nor his editor. It was only when he delivered the manuscript 10 months later that he learned copyright law meant he'd have to wait until 2021 to publish it.
Smith points to a quote from one of Fitzgerald's contemporaries as having provided the key to understanding Carraway. ""Ernest Hemingway says in [his memoir] A Moveable Feast that we didn't trust anyone who wasn't in the war, and to me that felt like a natural beginning for Nick."" Smith imagines Carraway, coping with PTSD and shellshock, returning home to a nation that he no longer recognises. It's a far cry from the riotous razzmatazz of all that partying, yet Carraway is, Smith suggests, the reason Fitzgerald's novel remains read. ""Maybe it's not the champagne and the dancing, maybe it is those feelings of wondering where we are, the sense that anything can crumble at any moment, that keep Gatsby meaningful from one generation to the next.""
William Cain, an expert in American literature and the Mary Jewett Gaiser Professor of English at Wellesley College, agrees that Nick is crucial to understanding the novel's richness. ""Fitzgerald gave some thought to structuring it in the third person but ultimately he chose Nick Carraway, a first-person narrator who would tell Gatsby's story, and who would be an intermediary between us and Gatsby. We have to respond to and understand Gatsby and, as we do so, remain aware that we're approaching him through Nick's very particular perspective, and through Nick's very ambivalent relationship to Gatsby, which is simultaneously full of praise and full of severe criticism, even at some moments contempt,"" he says.

Like Smith, Cain first encountered the novel as a student. It was a different era – the 1960s – but even so, little attention was paid to Nick. Cain recalls instead talk of symbolism – the legendary green light, for example, and Gatsby's fabled automobile. It's a reminder that, in a way, the education system is as much to blame as pop culture for our limited readings of this seminal text. It may be a Great American Novel but, at fewer than 200 pages, its sublimely economical storytelling makes its study points very easy to access. Ironically, given that this is a novel of illusion and delusion, in which surfaces are crucial, we all too often overlook the texture of its prose. As Cain puts it, ""I think when we consider The Great Gatsby, we need to think about it not just as a novel that is an occasion or a point of departure for us to talk about big American themes and questions, but we have to really enter into the richness of Fitzgerald's actual page-to-page writing. We have to come to Gatsby, yes, aware of its social and cultural significance, but also we need to return to it as a literary experience.""
Cain re-reads the novel every two or three years but frequently finds himself thinking about it in between – last summer, for instance, when US President Biden, accepting the Democratic nomination at the DNC, spoke of the right to pursue dreams of a better future. The American Dream is, of course, another of Gatsby's Big Themes, and one that continues to be misunderstood. ""Fitzgerald shows that that dream is very powerful, but that it is indeed a very hard one for most Americans to realise. It feeds them great hopes, great desires, and it's extraordinary, the efforts that so many of them make to fulfil those dreams and those desires, but that dream is beyond the reach of many, and many, they give up all too much to try to achieve that great success,"" Cain points out. Among the obstacles, Fitzgerald seems to suggest, are hard-and-fast class lines that no amount of money will enable Gatsby to cross. It's a view that resonates with a mood that Cain says he's been picking up on among his students – a certain ""melancholy"" for the American Dream, the feeling fanned by racial and economic inequalities that the pandemic has only deepened.
Ever since the book's first publication in 1925, readers have misunderstood it (Credit: Alamy)
In other certain respects, the novel hasn't worn quite so well. While Fitzgerald showed where his allegiances lay by highlighting the brute ugliness of Tom Buchanan's white supremacist beliefs, he repeatedly describes African Americans as ""bucks"". The novel makes for frustrating reading from a feminist perspective, too: its female characters lack dimensionality and agency, and are seen instead through the prism of male desire. The path is now open to endless creative responses to those more dated and unpleasant aspects, and a new ITV and A+E Studios TV mini-series announced last month looks set to be one of the first. Written by Michael Hirst and with Fitzgerald's great-granddaughter Blake Hazard on board as a consulting producer, it has been described as a ""reimagining"" of the classic novel. ""I have long dreamt of a more diverse, inclusive version of Gatsby that better reflects the America we live in, one that might allow us all to see ourselves in Scott's wildly romantic text,"" Hazard told The Hollywood Reporter.
To an impressive degree, however, the renewed attention brought by the change in law shows not just how relevant and seductive the text of Fitzgerald's novel remains, but how very alive it's always been. Pick it up at 27, and you'll find a different novel to the one you read as a teenager. Revisit it again at 45, and it'll feel like another book altogether. Copyright has never had any bearing on the impact of the words it governs.
Finally able to publish Nick, Smith returned once more to The Great Gatsby before turning in his last edit. ""I think it will be a novel that's always evolving in my head, and always changing based on who I am,"" he says. ""That's what great novels do.""
Nick by Michael Farris Smith is published in the UK on 25 Feb 2021 and is already available in the US.

"Pigs can play video games with their snouts, scientists find","https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56023720","Thu, 11 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","Hamlet - or perhaps Omelette - hits the arcade, hoping to win big
Pigs can play video games, scientists have found, after putting four fun-loving swine to the test.
Four pigs - Hamlet, Omelette, Ebony and Ivory - were trained to use an arcade-style joystick to steer an on-screen cursor into walls.
Researchers said the fact that the pigs understood the connection between the stick and the game ""is no small feat"".
And the pigs even continued playing when the food reward dispenser broke - apparently for the social contact.
Usually, the pigs would be given a food pellet for ""winning"" the game level. But during testing, it broke - and they kept clearing the game levels when encouraged by some of the researchers' kind words.
""This sort of study is important because, as with any sentient beings, how we interact with pigs and what we do to them impacts and matters to them,"" lead author Dr Candace Croney said. 
Ebony the pig operates a joystick
The research team also thought that the fact the pigs could play video games at all - since they are far-sighted animals with no hands or thumbs - was ""remarkable"".
But it was not easy for them.
Out of the two Yorkshire pigs, Hamlet, was better at the game than Omelette, but both struggled when it got harder - hitting the single target just under half the time.
The Panepinto micro pigs had a bigger gamer skill gap - while Ivory was able to hit one-wall targets 76% of the time, Ebony could only do it 34% of the time.
The pigs were first trained on a non-functioning joystick to get them used to the idea
But the researchers were still satisfied that the attempts were deliberate and focused, rather than random - what they called ""above chance"".
That means that ""to some extent, all acquired the association between the joystick and cursor movement"".
Kate Daniels, from Willow Farm in Worcestershire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while the scientists might have been impressed, ""I don't think this will come as a surprise to anyone that works with pigs"".
She added: ""They're not playing Minecraft - but that they can manipulate a situation to get a reward is no surprise at all.""
Lead author Dr Croney said the pigs' achievements were remarkable
She paraphrased a quote often attributed to Winston Churchill: ""Dogs look up to you, cats look down on you, and pigs look you right in the eye.""
She added: ""When you look a pig right in the eye, you can tell there's intelligence there.""
Still, pigs are no match for humans when playing games - or even less intelligent primates. 
The same kind of experiment has been tried with chimpanzees and monkeys, who have the advantage of opposable thumbs, and were able to meet much higher requirements from researchers.
The research paper was published in the journal, external Frontiers in Psychology.

"Anger as trading in GameStop shares is restricted","https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55837519","Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","Amateur investors are responding with outrage after trading platforms curbed buying of shares in the US games firm GameStop and other companies.
The moves by Robinhood and Interactive Brokers follow days of frenzied trading that led to massive gains for some stocks. 
Shares in GameStop dived by as much as 55% after the restrictions.
It is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants.
Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. 
But they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites such as Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in a week.
Other firms, such as AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry, also saw sharp gains. They were embraced by day traders after hedge funds bet against them.
The activity has drawn questions from regulators, who are monitoring trading amid fears of illegal actions.
GameStop: What is it and why is it trending?
'Failing' firm soars in value as amateurs buy stock
Victims typically lose £45,000 in investment scams
However, the amateur investors say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game.
In online forums they discussed legal action and accused Robinhood and other brokerages enacting their own form of market manipulation by restricting purchases of certain shares.
Robinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev tweeted that the firm had taken its decision based on regulatory requirements, and said limited buys of the restricted stocks would be allowed from Friday.

Myron Sakkas says traders like him are angry
""They support a capitalist free market only when it works for them. What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money,"" said 18-year-old Myron Sakkas of Coventry, a student at Warwick University.
Myron, who has had an account on the Trading 212 platform since August last year, said he had lost £30 on Gamestop shares, which he owned for ""a couple of hours"" and sold when he saw what was happening.
Myron said he had since been locked out of his account and unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the £1,000 he has in it and call a halt.
Though hoping to go into investment banking after he gets his degree, he said he was disillusioned by what he sees as ""market manipulation"" directed against people like him. 
""When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,"" he told the BBC.
""Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,"" he added. ""I've got other stuff to do.""
Key to what's going on is ""short selling"" or ""shorting"", where a big investment company such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall.
The hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit.
GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street.
But in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. 
If the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses  - a process known as covering.
However, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still.
And amateurs aren't the only ones getting in on the action.
This week, for example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
In the US, anger over the trading restrictions united politicians whose stances typically sharply diverge.
Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is taking over as chair of the banking committee, said he would hold a hearing about the ""state of the stock market"".
""People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they're the ones getting hurt,"" he said.

Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known for her leftist views, called the restrictions ""unacceptable"" and expressed support for a hearing, to which Sen Ted Cruz, a staunch Republican, replied on Twitter, ""Fully agree"".
Dave Portnoy, founder of the Barstool Sports blog, who has emerged as one of the most high-profile amateur traders during the pandemic, also attacked the restrictions, singling out Robinhood, which has cast itself as a platform aimed at making Wall Street more accessible.
The firm also makes money through fees paid by Wall Street firms that execute trades for its users.
""'Democratizing finance for all' except when we manipulate the market, cause too many ordinary people are getting rich,"" he wrote.

""Among the many aspects of this story that are strange, what is so unusual is the peculiar vigilante morality of the traders pumping the stock. They seem hell-bent on taking on Wall Street, they seem to hate hedge funds and threads are peppered with insults about 'boomer' money. 
""It's a generational fight, redistributive and all about robbing the rich to give to the millennial 'poor'.""
Elon Musk, who has a history of feuding with short sellers, also joined the fight, tweeting: ""Here come the shorty apologists. Give them no respect. Get Shorty.""

A one-word tweet by the billionaire entrepreneur on Tuesday - he tweeted ""Gamestonk!!"" - had been seen as giving Gamestop shares an extra boost.
The fracas follows a jump in casual investing during the pandemic, which saw people stuck at home with time on their hands and limited places to spend pour money into the market.

Despite the economy shrinking, US stocks have rallied
The surge has produced ripples of worry on Wall Street, including concerns that inexperienced investors could cause bubbles in certain stocks or were dabbling in investments with risks they did not fully understand.
Robinhood - which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new interest in investing - has faced particular scrutiny for the way its app has made investment seem like a game. 
Last year, Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint accusing the company of marketing to inexperienced users and failing to protect them.
Officials said this week they were following the market battle.
Press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday President Joe Biden’s economic team, including newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, was “monitoring the situation”.
Massachusetts state regulator William Galvin called on the New York Stock Exchange to suspend GameStop for 30 days to allow a cooling-off period. ""This isn't investing, this is gambling,"" he said in an interview. ""This is obviously contrived.""

"Warhammer sales surge for Games Workshop despite shop closures","https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55629984","Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","Games Workshop sells Warhammer miniatures around the world
Sales of the fantasy role-playing game Warhammer surged in the six months to November as people continued to spend more on their hobbies in lockdown.
Games Workshop, which makes the tabletop miniature game, saw sales hit a record £186.8m in the period, up 26%. 
This was despite most of the Nottingham firm's 529 shops being restricted or closed due to Covid rules.
It follows strong performances from other games and hobby firms in lockdown such as model train maker Hornby.
Created in 1983, Warhammer is a fantasy theme game in which players simulate battles between armies using plastic miniatures. 
Model train maker Hornby steams ahead in lockdown
Retailer of 'all things geeky' to open 100 new shops
Games Workshop, which sells Warhammer and other miniature wargames around the world, said its online sales were up 90% in May to November while profits increased by a third. 
Some 4.7 million people now use the Warhammer community website, it said, an increase of 200,000 on the same period last year. 
People play Warhammer competitively
Boss Kevin Rountree said the business continued to build on the ""great progress and profitable growth we have been consistently delivering over the last five years"".
The FTSE-listed firm has claimed no financial support or subsidies from the government during the pandemic, despite the prolonged closures of its shops. 
""I'd like to thank our enthusiastic and loyal fan base who share our love for the Warhammer hobby and the fantastical settings, characters and narratives that make up our intellectual property,"" Mr Rountree added. 
In October, Geek Retreat, which specialises in comics, memorabilia and tabletop games, said it would open another 100 stores in the UK after sales surged in the pandemic. 
And Hornby, which also makes Corgi cars and Scalextric racing kits, reported a 33% rise in revenue for the six months to the end of September partly driven by lockdown. 
At the time Boss Lyndon Davies told the BBC customers had been seeking comfort from uncertainty in products ""they know and love"", as well an escape from boredom. 
""People want to do things, they don't want to sit there watching the TV for the day,"" he said.

"Gamestop: 'Failing' firm soars in value as amateurs buy stock","https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55817918","Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","Shares in a US games company have soared more than 300% in the past week - the result of a fight between private and professional investors.
Video games bricks-and-mortar retailer Gamestop is arguably something of a relic in a world moving online.
But its share price soared another 120% in Wednesday trading in New York. 
Analysts blame tech-savvy young day traders, who they say are taking on hedge funds in a conflict with generational overtones.
And the phenomenon could be spreading to Europe, with several stocks subject to unusual fluctuations in Wednesday trading.
It's a battle between Wall Street pros and upstart investors using social media platforms such as Reddit, analysts say. And at the moment, the upstarts have the upper hand.
It is, says Neil Wilson from markets.com, getting weird: ""We are seeing some serious funny business in some corners of the market.""
""Will it end badly?"" asks Thomas Hayes, managing director at Great Hill Capital hedge fund. ""Sure. We just don't know when.""
What's driving up the Gamestop price? Certainly not any good news coming out of the company. Gamestop - described as a ""failing mall-based retailer"" by one professional investor - made a loss of $795m in 2019, and probably several hundred more in 2020.
But that's not deterred an army of social media day traders, with access to free and low-cost trading platforms such as Robinhood, and who probably have a lot of time on their hands during lockdown. They've been swapping tips and ramping up prices via Reddit's chat thread wallstreetbets.
Gamestop is not the only stock in their sights - Blackberry, AMC and Nokia Oyjis are others - but is currently the battleground between the Goliaths like hedge funds and big investors, and the Davids who make up Reddit's private punters.
Key to what's going on is ""shorting"", where, say, a hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors in the belief that the price of stock is going to fall. 
The hedge fund sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit.
That's the somewhat simplistic theory, anyway.
Gamestop is the most shorted stock on Wall Street, with some 30% of the shares thought to be in the hands of hedge fund borrowers. 
But Reddit's retail investors have embarked on a frenzy of share buying and options trades, pushing up the price and putting a ""short squeeze"" on the pros.
In this supercharged trading environment, the big Wall Street investors rush back into the market to limit their losses, with the demand pushing up the price still further. 
One hedge fund, Melvin Capital Management, reportedly had to be bailed out with more than $2bn to cover losses on some shares, including Gamestop, while another short-seller, Citron Research, has also withdrawn from the fray.
For many Reddit investors, it's not just about making money. They smell blood.
Analyst Neil Wilson says that from reading the Reddit chat threads, the day traders' battle with Wall Street is clearly personal. 
""Among the many aspects of this story that are strange, what is so unusual is the peculiar vigilante morality of the traders pumping the stock. They seem hell-bent on taking on Wall Street, they seem to hate hedge funds and threads are peppered with insults about 'boomer' money. 
""It's a generational fight, redistributive and all about robbing the rich to give to the millennial 'poor'.""
But many big investors are refusing to budge and continue to hold their Gamestop stock at rock-bottom prices. They believe the tide will turn on Reddit's herd instinct and Gamestop shares will come back to earth.
""These are not normal times and while the [Reddit] thing is fascinating to watch, I can't help but think that this is unlikely to end well for someone,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said.
In the meantime, some European stocks appear to have been targeted in similar fashion by day traders.
They include media company Pearson, which saw its share price surge nearly 14% in London trading on Wednesday, and German drugs firm Evotec, which rose 9.6% in Frankfurt.
In another surprise twist, the unprecedented rally was given a further boost by Elon Musk.
The billionaire Tesla boss tweeted the word ""Gamestonk"", along with a link to the Reddit message board that had been pumping the stock. 
For its part, Reddit said it had not been contacted by the authorities over the stock price movements.
""Reddit's site-wide policies prohibit posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal transactions. We will review and co-operate with valid law enforcement investigations or actions as needed,"" a spokeswoman said.
The market turmoil has even come to the attention of new US President Joe Biden, with the White House saying it is ""monitoring the situation"".
For stock market veterans, it's an example of the madness of speculative trading that can only end in tears. And for regulators, it's a headache, as they are the ones who should be cracking down on market manipulation.
Jacob Frenkel, a former lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the main US financial regulator, said: ""Such volatile trading fuelled by opinions where there appears to be little corporate activity to justify the price movement is exactly what SEC investigations are made of.""
However, other experts believe Reddit's legion of investors represent a generational shift in attitudes to money and use of new technology. 
""I don't think this is a fad,"" said John Patrick Lee, a video game investment expert at VanEck. ""A retail trader will not lean on Wall Street to manage their money and I definitely now see an antagonistic relationship between the old guard [Wall Street] and individual traders who are on the rise,"" he said.

"Are in-app purchases ruining mobile video games?","https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-56215030","Mon, 01 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","We know more people are playing video games in the pandemic.
Not all of those will be sitting down to play on their consoles or PCs.
Recent research suggests that one in two people with a smartphone will have played a game on their phone in the last week, external. 
How many of those games make money however has been a consistent talking point, external within the gaming industry for years.
The techniques some developers use to hook and retain players, however, are controversial.
Particularly when games advertised as ""free"" come with in-app purchases, sometimes known as microtransactions.

""If money hinders you from playing this game that's posing as free-to-play, but it's not - that's what frustrates me,"" says Jay-Ann Lopez, founder of Black Girl Gamers, talking on this week's BBC Sounds Press X to Continue podcast.
""If you want people to pay for your game, give [them] an upfront fee. I would gladly pay for a game to download onto my phone that I'm going to enjoy forever. 
""I don't want to be advertised to all the time. And I think it's becoming quite dangerous, how advertisements are everywhere. 
""When it comes to these mobile games, and they stop you from actually enjoying the game until you pay; I don't enjoy that kind of financial model.""
Research suggests that the amount of money players spent on mobile games globally increased by 13% year-on-year from 2017 to 2018 - with around £50 billion spent on them in total, external. 
Press X to Continue reviewer Inel Tomlinson, has some sympathy for studios trying to make mobile games: ""I do think it's a lot harder for developers to charge upfront costs.
""The latest Professor Layton game came out on mobile before it came out on the Nintendo Switch. And on mobile, it cost twenty quid, and everyone's like - 'I ain't touching that. Twenty quid for a mobile game? You're having a laugh'.
""It came out on the Switch for £40 - the same game. Everyone bought it.""
Trying to stand out in a saturated mobile game market is hard.
A recent trend in mobile games forces players to wait until they can access certain levels or items - unless, of course, they're prepared to pay for the privilege - and it's these kinds of techniques that irritate some gamers. 
""In certain mobile games, for instance, you play for ten minutes. And then it's like, 'oh, you've now run out of lives',"" says comedian Glenn Moore.
""Your lives replenish in 24 hours, or you can buy some now and I'm like, 'is this a game being really irresponsible about my finances? Or is the game being really responsible for my playtime?' 
""I think it's the first one. It's definitely the first one.""

""[Developers of mobile games] have got to make money. So I understand that you've got to think of new ways of doing it,"" says podcast host Steffan Powell.
""When monetisation gets in the way of the experience? That's when I start questioning it.""
But while there is so much money to be made there will still be plenty of games that rely on this funding model. 
Jay-Ann hopes that she can overcome her frustration to experience some of the games that are out thereon mobile devices.

"GameStop: What is it and why is it trending?","https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-55841719","Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","You've probably stared blankly at your WhatsApp chat as the words ""GameStop"", ""Reddit"" and ""stock market"" get thrown around the way ""pub"" and ""meet at 8"" used to.
Your friends have become Jordan Belfort from the Wolf of Wall Street overnight, and you have no idea what they're on about.
Well, we see you slyly Googling ""What is a GameStop?"" and we're here to help.
Everyone loves a story of plucky underdogs and sticking it to ""The Man"" - and this one is a belter.
First, let's get the basics sorted.
GameStop is an American high street shop that sells games, consoles and other electronics.
The sort of thing you'd find between a doughnut shop and a makeup retailer in an American mall.
It's not anything new and exciting, in fact it wasn't doing very well because of the pandemic.
If you're not on Reddit, it's a social media site - kind of like Twitter or Facebook.
You join forums about particular topics you're interested in.
There are Love Island forums, football forums, history forums - you name it.
The one that's important in this story is called wallstreetbets. More than four million people are in it, usually discussing stocks and shares and where they're going to invest money.
This really is the basics, you're not Jordan yet
Like we mentioned, GameStop wasn't exactly thriving. 
With fewer people out shopping due to the pandemic and most games being sold online, things weren't looking great for the company.
People who buy and sell stocks often bet on which companies won't do well in the future. 
They borrow shares in the company and sell them, with a promise to buy them back at a later date. 
If you're sure the company will lose value, you'd make a profit when you buy them back and the price has fallen.
If you're still confused, it's analogy time.
Imagine you borrow some Pokemon cards from a mate, because you think the price of them is about to drop, and agree to give them back in a month. 
Then you sell them to someone else for £5 per pack.
You work on the assumption that you'll be paying less than a fiver for them after a month when they're not so new and exciting anymore. Let's say you buy them back for £3.
Congratulations, you've made £2!
This is a massively simplified explanation of something called shorting, or short selling - words you might've seen cropping up in your feeds in the last few days.
Think of it as gambling. If your bet was wrong and the price actually rises instead of falling, you'd lose money.
GameStop amateurs outwit Wall Street 
GameStop was one of the companies that loads of hedge funds (companies who do these bets) had bet on to lose a lot of value.
But huge numbers of people in the wallstreetbets Reddit forum swapped tips and bought shares in GameStop.
The demand raised its share price massively, which nobody saw coming, and everyone who had banked on it dropping in value had to buy their shares back.
The Tesla boss loves a tweet - and when he does, financial worlds tend to take notice. This one-word entry was enough to further send GameStop's price soaring.

He also linked to the Wall Street bets forum, where he's lovingly referred to as Papa Musk.
It's a good question.
For lots of people involved, it was just a laugh. 
Some excitement, something to pass the time with - an experiment to see the power of internet communities. 
Wall Street commentators have called it a ""phenomenon"", ""insane"", and like ""nothing [they've] ever seen"".
For many, the aim was to make stockbrokers and hedge funds lose money. Popular threads on Reddit include people saying it was payback - taking revenge against the big money companies seen as causing the financial crash in 2008.
Analyst Neil Wilson says some of the traders had a ""peculiar vigilante morality"".
""They seem hell-bent on taking on Wall Street, they seem to hate hedge funds and threads are peppered with insults about 'boomer' money.
""It's a generational fight, redistributive and all about robbing the rich to give to the millennial 'poor'.""
Some people on the forum said they donated their earnings to charity afterwards.
If nothing else, it was a good chance to make some memes.

"GameStop: Who is winning the market battle?","https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55864608","Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","This video can not be played
WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop?
Financial markets have been riveted by the tale of novice investors taking on Wall Street pros by buying up shares of US video games retailer GameStop, which many hedge funds had seen as a losing bet.
It's an apparently crowd-sourced attempt to beat billionaire traders at their own game.
But who's really winning and losing this battle?
GameStop, a loss-making chain of bricks-and-mortar shops, saw shares jump from being worth less than $20 each at the end of December to nearly $350 on Wednesday.
The surge has been attributed to a swarm of independent traders, swapping tips on social media, who saw an opportunity to pressure Wall Street hedge funds that had made deals assuming GameStop's share price would fall - and would have to purchase shares to cover losses if the stock rose more than expected. 
That, in turn, could generate a kind of buying frenzy - and chance for gains for the little guys.
In recent weeks, they've deployed the strategy on behalf of other firms, such as struggling theatre chain AMC Entertainment, owner of Odeon Cinemas. 
And the idea has caught on globally, fuelling activity in stocks traded in other parts of the world, including the UK, Brazil and Malaysia.

Asian investors inspired by GameStop surge
The social media forums where the amateur day-traders stoked enthusiasm for GameStop are full of snapshots showing how their bets have performed -  in some cases growing from tiny sums to positions worth millions of dollars.
But for many, these are just gains on paper - and could still end in big losses if the prices fall back.

AOC calls the GameStop saga ""a weird collision of social forces and economic factors""
On Thursday, after the wacky market conditions prompted some trading platforms, such as Robinhood, to restrict purchases, shares dipped.  Some traders posted comments confessing to nerves at the prospect of losses, while rallying their fellows to hold the line and avoid selling, staving off a sudden price collapse.
And on Friday, GameStop shares rose again, climbing 68% to $325 apiece, even as the market overall dropped.
If prices drop back, however, some who bought in too late will be hurt.
Billionaire investor Steve Cohen is among those reportedly facing losses
The buying frenzy has reportedly led to losses for some big name hedge funds, including Point72, a firm run by infamous investor Steve Cohen, a billionaire art collector and owner of the New York Mets baseball team whose first hedge fund, SAC Capital, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and shut down. 
Some of the losses this week stemmed from Point72 money being managed by Melvin Capital, a company founded by a former SAC star trader, which had made big bets against Gamestop and was forced to pull out of the trade.
Other firms reportedly hit include Maplelane Capital and DI Capital, while other prominent short sellers have said  they - and their families - have been subject to harassment.
Analysts also say the pressure on hedge funds is one force behind broader declines in US markets in recent days, as firms sell other investments to cover their losses.
Mr Cohen, whose firm helped provide rescue funding to Melvin Capital amid the upheaval, has appeared to allude to the strains caused by the Reddit army, writing on Twitter: ""Hey stock jockeys keep bringing it"".

That's not to say there aren't investing pros benefiting from the battle against the short-sellers - many of which are still betting stocks will fall.
Firms like investment giant Fidelity and BlackRock, which own more than 10% of GameStop shares, have seen the value of their holdings rise. 
The surge also benefited Ryan Cohen, an entrepreneur who sold his online pet retail company Chewy to Petsmart in 2017 and revealed a major investment in GameStop last year.
Elizabeth Warren has called the GameStop trading frenzy a sign of market distortion and called on regulators to act
Executives at some companies favoured by the day traders, such as BlackBerry, have gotten windfalls from selling their shares.
It's creating opportunities for other kinds of companies too. For example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
In other ways, however, the episode could bode ill for Wall Street in Washington, where Democrats now claim slim majorities and Congress was already eying tax hikes for hedge funds. 
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent voice in favour of tougher rules, has said the episode warrants wider investigation, pointing to fault on both sides of the battle, which she said was a sign of market distortions that could put the rest of the economy at risk. 
The founder of trading app Robinhood, which is facing even more scrutiny
Regulators already had their eyes on Robinhood, an app used to buy and sell shares that has seen its popularity explode amid the pandemic. 
The Silicon Valley company, which makes money in part from fees charged to Wall Street funds that execute customer orders, is accused of courting inexperienced investors and encouraging them to trade frequently and deploy risky strategies - even if it goes against customer interests.
This episode has only intensified regulator scrutiny.
Global watchdogs on alert as GameStop frenzy grows
Anger as trading in GameStop shares is restricted
Meanwhile, the firm said late Thursday it had raised more than $1bn amid questions about financial strains on the firm created by the buying frenzy. 
It's also facing outrage from customers - and lawmakers - angry after Robinhood was among the trading platforms to limit purchases of Gamestop and others' stocks, citing market volatility and risk.
GameStop, with more than 5,000 stores in the US and elsewhere, was losing money even before the pandemic
Many of the companies whose shares have been championed by day traders in the battle against the short-sellers are what have been dubbed ""90s nostalgia stocks"" - firms buffeted by changes wrought technology, like the decline of traffic to bricks and mortar shops and cinemas. 
The pandemic has only hammered them harder.
GameStop, which was founded in 1996 and now has more than 5,000 stores in the US, Canada, Australia and elsewhere, saw sales fall 30% in the first nine months of 2020. 
AMC Entertainment, the owner of Odeon Cinemas, meanwhile, warned last month it risked running out of cash, after traffic to its theatres plunged last year.
Some of those firms have seized opportunities created by the recent trading to ease financial strains.
AMC, for example, raised more than $300m by selling shares this week and has said it is exploring additional offerings.
American Airlines has said it is also planning to sell shares.
But regardless of what happens next in the financial markets, the challenges facing them in the real world aren't going away.

"Robinhood boss says GameStop episode 'unacceptable'","https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56116545","Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT","BBC.com","Vlad Tenev, co-founder of Robinhood, said his firm was forced to temporarily limit GameStop trades.
The head of the Robinhood trading platform has apologised to customers at a US congressional hearing prompted by last month's GameStop trading frenzy.
Vlad Tenev said the situation the firm faced in January - when financial strains led it to limit certain stock purchases - was ""unacceptable to us"".
""We are doing everything we can to make sure this won't happen again,"" he said.
Lawmakers said the move, which sparked outrage, had raised questions about fairness in financial markets.
""Many Americans feel that the system is stacked against them and no matter what, Wall Street always wins,"" said congresswoman Maxine Waters, who heads the House Financial Services Committee holding the hearing.
Mr Tenev said the firm, which is popular among everyday investors, was forced to temporarily limit trades in GameStop and some other firms due to new financial requirements it faced because of the surge in trading.

He said the firm moved quickly to raise new funds, which would help it avoid making similar moves in the future. 
He also denied that Robinhood had been acting at the behest of anyone else.  
""I'm sorry for what happened. I apologise,"" he said. ""I'm not going to say that Robinhood did everything perfectly, and that we haven't made mistakes in the past, but what I commit to is that we improve from this.""

GameStop: The amateur traders fighting Wall Street
Other key players called to testify at the hearing also denied wrongdoing in the affair, which saw the price of GameStop shares rise from less than $20 at the beginning of January to more than $350 in a matter of weeks.
The astonishing rise, apparently fuelled by a swarm of independent traders swapping tips on social media forums such as Reddit, has sparked probes examining the possibility of market manipulation and other potential conflicts of interest.
Robinhood's ties to Wall Street firm Citadel Securities have faced particular scrutiny. 
Robinhood receives fees from the market maker Citadel Securities, which pays to execute Robinhood customer orders. Citadel, the hedge fund business, and its partners last month invested in Melvin Capital, one of the hedge funds hit by losses after betting that GameStop's shares would fall.
Citadel and Robinhood attracted most of the attention at the hearing
Kenneth Griffin, the founder of Citadel Securities, said no-one in his company had any discussions with Robinhood about restricting trades in GameStop or other so-called ""meme stocks"".
""I first learned of Robinhood's trading restrictions after they were announced,"" he said.
Mr Griffin and Mr Tenev attracted most of the attention at the sometimes combative hearing, which saw lawmakers raise potential regulatory changes, such as requirements that firms disclose when they have made large bets against a stock.
Melvin Capital hedge fund manager Gabriel Plotkin told lawmakers that he was wary of holding short positions again after retail investors pushed GameStop shares higher, causing the firm shed 53% of its value.   
""They exploited an opportunity around short selling and we will have to adapt and the whole industry will have to adapt,"" he said.
Republicans sought to head off new rules, noting that it was government requirements that precipitated Robinhood to limit trades.
""Piling on more and more regulations only increases complexity and does not help investors,"" said Barry Loudermilk, a Republican representative from Georgia.
Ms Waters hit back at characterisations of the hearing as ""political theatre"" - but also suggested that she was not rushing to additional action.
""I didn't hear anyone here say they were ready to pile on regulations,"" she said.
Others testifying at the hearing included Melvin Capital chief executive Gabriel  Plotkin, Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman, and Keith Gill, a Reddit user and YouTube streamer known as Roaring Kitty who promoted his investment in GameStop.
Shares in the loss-making video games retailer have fallen back since January, closing at about $40 on Thursday.
