"GameStop stock surge lingo: Here's what Reddit's WallStreetBets vocabulary means","https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/gamestop-stock-surge-lingo-heres-what-reddits-wallstreetbets-vocabulary-means/","Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","CNET","
    Here are some of the slang terms that are part of a movement that's assisting in driving the price of some stocks.
  
Reddit's community, WallStreetBets, is still assisting in the rise of GameStop's stock, which is currently sitting at $272 per share and even hit an all-time high last week. Reddit users are battling it out with Wall Street to keep GameStop's stock prices soaring while Wall Street expected a crash. Small investors are using Reddit communities to drive ""meme stocks,"" causing short sales and short squeezes. And it's not just GameStop. Other companies, like AMC and Nokia, have also been affected by the coordinated surge.
No, this doesn't mean you should necessarily drop everything and fully invest in the stock of the moment. Some are calling the market manipulation a ""Ponzi scheme,"" and the stock price will likely even out once the hullabaloo dies down. 
In fact, broker TD Ameritrade restricted trading of the GameStop and AMC stocks on Jan. 26 and continues to post an advisory note to clients about market volatility. Trading app Robinhood followed suit on Jan. 27 in response to the runaway growth -- the company got itself into trouble by restricting stock trades and will be closely reviewed by the SEC (It's currently limiting buys on AMC and GameStop stocks). The White House has said it's monitoring the situation.
Part of what's so unusual about the GameStop stock spike is the vocabulary that's been used to drive the trading action. Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, helped fuel the activity with a one-word tweet on Jan. 26: ""Gamestonk."" 
What's a stonk, and what does it have to do with trading? Here's a sampling of the lingo behind the enormous highs, and what the terms mean: 
Stonks is often associated with Meme Man, pictured.

"Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming is expanding testing to iOS and PC browsers tomorrow","https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/microsofts-xbox-cloud-gaming-is-expanding-testing-to-ios-and-pc-browsers-tomorrow/","Mon, 19 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT","CNET","
    The xCloud beta finally is coming to Apple products.
  
Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming is about to head to web browsers. 
Microsoft's Xbox Cloud Gaming is expanding. On Monday the company announced that starting tomorrow it will begin testing the browser-based version of the service with 
  Windows 10
 PCs and 
  Apple
 phones and tablets.
Previously known as Project xCloud, the new service allows for streaming full-featured Xbox games over the internet onto devices that aren't on your home Wi-Fi or near your physical console. Catherine Gluckstein, vice president and head of product for Project xCloud, writes in a blog post that the expansion to web browsers will be limited to start. 
""Starting tomorrow, we'll begin sending out invites to select Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members to start testing the Xbox Cloud Gaming limited beta for Windows 10 PCs and Apple phones and tablets via web browsers,"" Gluckstein writes, adding that the company's plan is to ""iterate quickly and open up to all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members in the coming months."" 
Those invited into the test will be able to play ""over 100 Xbox Game Pass titles through Edge, Google Chrome, or Safari"" by heading to xbox.com/play. 
You will need ""a compatible Bluetooth or USB-connected controller"" (an Xbox or PlayStation 4 controller will work) though ""more than 50 games"" will also feature ""custom touch controls"" for playing using your phone's touchscreen. A full list of compatible remotes can be found on Microsoft's site. 
Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is Microsoft's $15 (£11, AU$16) per month Xbox subscription service that includes Xbox Live Gold, the ability to play using Xbox Cloud Gaming and access to over 100 games on Xbox consoles or PC. Microsoft has been building out Game Pass' game selection in recent weeks, notably adding Sony's MLB The Show 21 (which launches on Tuesday) and bringing back Grand Theft Auto V.
Already available on Android and the Xbox Game Pass PC app since its official launch last September, Microsoft had planned to bring xCloud to 
  iOS
 devices through a dedicated app, but was stymied by Apple's App Store rules. In a statement last year, the company blasted Apple saying that the iPhone-maker ""stands alone as the only general purpose platform to deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services like Xbox Game Pass."" 
Apple since changed its rules, but Microsoft was still not pleased as Apple required each Xbox game to be submitted as individual apps as opposed to living inside a single Xbox Cloud Gaming portal. 
By going through a web browser, Microsoft follows other cloud gaming efforts like Amazon's Luna, figuring out a way to bring the service to Apple users without needing to get Apple's approval first."
"Robinhood backlash: What you should know about the GameStop stock controversy","https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/","Mon, 22 Mar 2021 20:00:06 GMT","CNET","
    Lawmakers, regulators and Reddit aren't happy with the popular investing app.
  
Robinhood users aren't so merry. 
Popular 
  investing
 app Robinhood became the focus of the controversy after it decided to freeze trades for 
  GameStop
 on Jan. 28. Shares of the video game retailer spiked after traders on 
  Reddit
 began frantically buying the company's stock. GameStop shares have since came crashing down only to shoot up once again. 
Robinhood played a critical role when a group of Reddit posters saw an opportunity to make 
  money
 while also giving a jab to Wall Street and hedge funds. However, Robinhood made the surprising move to restrict buying GameStop citing issues with volatile stock and regulatory requirements. Due to its part in the trading frenzy, Robinhood has been scrutinized by its users, regulators and lawmakers. 
We have some answers for the big questions about Robinhood, the actions it took and what might happen next.

Robinhood is an investing app that launched in 2015. It's popular among millennials, who make up a majority of its users and can conduct a variety of investments for free. Read more about Robinhood here. 
On the morning of Jan. 28, Robinhood posted a blog saying it was limiting users by preventing them from buying stocks from several companies such as GameStop, 
  AMC
 and 
  Nokia
. It cited ""market volatility"" as its reasoning and would only allow customers to sell their shares of these companies, not buy or trade in any other way (more below). 
""In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD and $NOK,"" Robinhood said. In addition to AMC; Bed, Bath and Beyond; GameStop and Nokia, the companies that Robinhood listed by ticker symbol are phone maker BlackBerry, fashion retailer Express, headphone maker Koss and underwear company Naked Brand Group.
In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AMC and $GME. Read more here.https://t.co/CdJMjGAeFH
On Jan. 29, Robinhood posted another blog about what happened. The company explained it was required to keep a substantial amount of money on hand in order to process all the trades happening through its clearinghouse, which is the part of the company that sends shares and money back and forth to other clearinghouses to complete trades. 
Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev went into more specifics when he 
  jumped
 on the Good Time Show with Tesla CEO Elon Musk via the exclusive audio-only Clubhouse app on Jan. 31.
""At 3:30 a.m. Pacific, our operations receives a file from the NSCC, which is the National Securities Clearing Corporation,"" he said during the show. ""So they gave us a file with a deposit, and the request was around $3 billion, which is about an order of magnitude more than it typically is."" 
Tenev provided some context by saying that, up to that point, Robinhood had raised just $2 billion in capital. He went on to explain that the NSCC has a formula to determine how much a deposit it needed and one component of it involved risk, which can act as a kind of multiplier. 
""We had no choice in this case,"" he said. ""We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements."" 
Tenev said that since then, the agency has worked with Robinhood to decrease the amount of funds needed. The company also raised $1 billion in emergency capital to make sure customers' trades can happen. 
Robinhood sent an email to customers in the afternoon of Jan. 28 saying it would allow ""limited buys"" of those company stock starting the next day. The limits included a maximum number of shares users could own (at one point it was down to one GameStop share), no trading options, no borrowing money on credit also known as margin, recurring investments were skipped and no fractional shares, which are slices of a stock that can be bought for as little as a dollar. 
As of Feb. 3, Robinhood increased the maximum of shares allowed for all the companies, with GameStop's limit up to 500 shares total. The other restrictions are still in place. 
A ton of people. The subreddit behind the GameStop's skyrocketing share value, r/WallStreetBets, includes big users of Robinhood who felt they were slighted by the decision. 
The subreddit's Twitter account said the freeze harmed small traders and favored the Wall Street establishment. ""Individual investors are being stripped of their ability to trade on [the Robinhood app],"" the tweet said. ""Meanwhile, hedge funds and institutional investors can continue to trade as normal.""
Robinhood users flooded the Google Play Store and 
  Apple's
 App Store with negative app reviews. There were so many one-star ratings that Google intervened to remove tens of thousands of them. 
There's was also a lawsuit filed on Jan. 28 in the Southern District of New York accusing Robinhood of ""purposefully, willfully, and knowingly removing the stock 'GME' from its trading platform in the midst of an unprecedented stock rise ... deprived retail investors of the ability to invest in the open-market.""
Several members of Congress, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Sen. Ted Cruz, called for a hearing on Robinhood's actions. 
The New York attorney general says she will review what Robinhood did while the Texas attorney general launched an investigation.
And the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the 
  stock market
, released a statement that didn't name Robinhood but said it will ""closely review actions taken by regulated entities that may disadvantage investors or otherwise unduly inhibit their ability to trade certain securities."" 
SEC investigators are already reviewing social media and Reddit posts for any signs of fraud according to a report from Bloomberg. The commission also met with newly appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to discuss the market volatility surrounding GameStop as reported on by Reuters. 
Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California and chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, held a hearing about Robinhood's actions called Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide. The chief executives of Reddit, Robinhood, Citadel and Melvin Capital, along with the Reddit poster who spearheaded the GameStop buying frenzy, were all in attendance at the hearing through video conferencing.
While the executives were questioned by the committee, not much new information was uncovered in the five hours. 
Following the hearing and a lawsuit by the family of one app user who committed suicide, Robinhood said it would invest in its customer service support. The legal action against the investing platform focuses on how Alex Kearns, a 20-year-old customer, didn't hear back from the company after the app showed he had racked up $730,000 in losses. Robinhood's customer service did eventually respond to the issue and confirmed he didn't owe the money, but it was too late. 
On Feb. 26, Robinhood confirmed it was working with US regulators, state attorneys and the SEC on various inquiries about the company's practices as reported by Yahoo Finance.  
Other investing 
  apps
 and services also had issues with clearing trades similar to Robinhood. Cash App tweeted it would not process trades for AMC and Nokia due to their broker, Axos, halting trades. 
The clearing broker who processes our trades, Axos, has temporarily halted buys of $AMC & $NOK. This was not Cash App’s decision - we disagree with this move wholeheartedly. We hope to make these stocks available for purchase again as soon as possible.
""The clearing broker who processes our trades, Axos, has temporarily halted buys of $AMC & $NOK,"" the company tweeted. ""This was not Cash App's decision -- we disagree with this move wholeheartedly. We hope to make these stocks available for purchase again as soon as possible.""
A Cash App blog post explained further saying that the Depository Trust Company (DTC) informed Axos it would need to significantly increase capital requirements for the trades it would be processing. 
Webull is another investing app that tweeted Jan. 28 it had begun restricting trades on shares of GameStop, AMC and Koss. Webull cited the ""extreme volatility"" of the stocks in limiting user transactions to closing positions. It later removed those restrictions the same day. Webull CEO Anthony Denier said the company's clearing firm also received notice it would need to increase its capital requirements significantly in order to accommodate all the trades, which led to the temporary halt in trading on those volatile stocks. 
TD Ameritrade, another brokerage, said Jan. 27 it would put restrictions on the trading of stocks for GameStop, AMC and others. The brokerage firm confirmed the restrictions, saying it made the decisions ""out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors."" The limits included increasing the amount needed to borrow on margin and limiting other trade options such as short sales. 
Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, E-Trade and Public were other investing services that also limited trading last week because of market volatility. 
Correction, Jan. 28: An earlier version of this story incorrectly said TD Ameritrade had restricted new purchases of GameStop and AMC stocks. It's restricting certain trades, but users are still able to purchase new shares from those companies. "

    You no longer need an Xbox Live Gold membership to jump into free-to-play games like Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone and Fortnite.
  
You don't need an Xbox Live Gold membership to join your friends in Destiny 2. By contrast, PlayStation players need a PS Plus subscription for the game's multiplayer.
Microsoft on Wednesday unlocked free-to-play multiplayer games for everyone, meaning you won't need an Xbox Live Gold subscription to dive in. The company revealed the list of games you can try for free and noted that the list will be updated as more titles are released.
In January, Microsoft slammed the brakes on plans to raise the price of Xbox Live Gold memberships, due to social media backlash -- many interpreted the plans as the company trying to push them to upgrade to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, its top subscription service. At the time, Microsoft also promised to remove the Gold requirement from free-to-play games.

    Subscribers are going to have a lot more stuff to play as of March 12.
  
Some big games are coming to Game Pass.
Microsoft's acquisition of ZeniMax Media was a done deal Tuesday, after regulators gave their approval. This means some of the biggest games made by Bethesda, id Software and Arkane Studios are now the property of the Xbox maker, so these games are coming to Game Pass.
Microsoft revealed the 20 games that'll be added to the Game Pass catalog starting March 12. These games include recent titles such as Rage 2, Doom Eternal and Fallout 76, along with some classic games including Doom, Wolfenstein and The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. The titles will be available either on PC, Xbox console or via xCloud, Microsoft's cloud gaming service. 
Here's the list of games and which versions will be available: 
Microsoft said Thursday that some games will get an FPS bump on the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles, though details will come sometime later. 
As for future Bethesda games such as Starfield, Elder Scrolls VI and Deathloop, Xbox head Phil Spencer said Thursday during a roundtable that there are ""contractual obligations"" that must be filled and the partnership is about delivering exclusive games to ""where Game Pass exists."" This could likely refer to these major games still coming to other platforms such as the PlayStation 5, but it's still not so clear. 
Xbox Game Pass is available for $9.99 a month on PC or console or for $14.99 a month for Ultimate Game Pass that includes both. "

    After skipping last year, Amazon plans to broadcast Yankees games on Prime this season, for fans in the New York area.
  
Aaron Judge and his New York Yankees will be on Amazon Prime Video this season. 
New York Yankees baseball is coming to Amazon Prime, at least for those in the New York area. The e-commerce giant announced on Wednesday that it will be offering 21 regular-season broadcasts of Yankees games to Prime members in New York state, Connecticut, northeast Pennsylvania, and north and central New Jersey.
The announcement follows Amazon's purchase of a piece of the Yankees' YES Network in 2019. The company had planned to air 21 Yankees games last season, but that idea was scrapped due to the pandemic. The broadcasts, which start on April 18 when the Bronx Bombers take on the AL-champion Tampa Bay Rays, will be free to those who live in the above areas and subscribe to Amazon's Prime service. 
Other notable Prime-broadcasted matchups include a Subway Series game against the New York Mets on July 2 and rivalry games versus the Boston Red Sox on July 23, Aug. 17 and Sept. 24. As with other Amazon sports telecasts, the company will be incorporating its X-Ray feature to let viewers ""access live in-game stats, team and player details, and real-time play-by-play information."" 
The games will be available to watch on any device that has access to Prime Video, but the X-Ray perks will be limited to those streaming on Android, iOS and Fire TV devices. While streaming on its service, Amazon notes that it does not have the exclusive on these games and that they will also air on traditional TV stations such as PIX11, YES and ""other over-the-air partners for Yankees telecasts.""  
Amazon's broadcasting of Yankees games is its latest expansion into the world of sports for its Prime Video service. Last week the company announced that it had acquired the rights to the NFL's Thursday Night Football package for the next decade starting in 2023.
A full list of the Yankees' games coming up on Prime Video and New York's opponents is below. Games played on the road are designated with an @. All times are in ET."

    The PS5 is still hard to find at major retailers, but we've got all the links you need to help locate the console.
  
This story is no longer updated. Instead, please go to the newer version, located here: PS5 restock updates: Retailer inventory at Best Buy, GameStop, Sony, Walmart, Amazon and more
Finding a Sony PS5 is like participating in an elaborate game of hide-and-seek. It's out there somewhere; on any given day, retailers such as Best Buy, GameStop and Sony's own PlayStation Store may suddenly have a PS5 restock. We're doing our best to update you when that happens, but in the meantime you can try your luck by using our PS5 inventory links below.
If you do happen upon some PlayStation 5 availability and find yourself in a queue to complete the check-out process, use as many devices and web browsers as you can. On a desktop, for example, you could open the store page in Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Then you could do likewise on your phone and tablet. It's like with lottery tickets: The more you have, the better your chances of winning, or in this case buying a console.
Just can't wait another minute? You have little choice but to pay obscene markups on sites like eBay and StockX. On eBay, for example, we've seen the PS5 priced well over $1,000. 
The PS5 is available in two versions: There's a $500 model with a Blu-ray drive and an otherwise identical $400 digital-only version with no disc slot. At this point, people are happy to get their hands on either one, but if you don't have a library of optical discs -- for Blu-ray movies, used 
  games
 or old PS4 games -- CNET recommends that you go with the $400 version.

Remember to check back here for news and updates on new PS5 availability. You can also browse all the major retailers to see their restock status. The list below has links to the PS5 product pages at each store.    
Best Buy is offering the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500 as well as the $400 Digital Edition (which you can find by clicking the button below). The retailer is also offering a slew of accessories on its PS5 landing page.
You can check out Amazon's page for the $400 Digital Edition via the button below, or, if you'd rather, get in line for the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500.
You can check inventory on the $400 Digital Edition at Walmart by clicking the button below, or you can try to snag the pricier PS5 with Blu-ray for $500.
GameStop will offer both the $400 Digital Edition (click the button below) as well as the pricier PS5 with Blu-ray for $500. Expect to also be able to buy a full range of PS5 accessories from GameStop like the Pulse 3D wireless headset for $100.
Target will be offering the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500 in addition to the PS5 Digital Edition, which you can find by clicking the button below.
OK, you've exhausted all of the online and brick-and-mortar retailers, and you've decided you're willing to pay upward of a $300 markup to get this puppy soon. As your friends, we have to tell you: Don't do it. But if you don't want to listen to us, you might want to check out StockX, an eBay alternative that made its name in the secondary market for sneakers and designer clothing. Last time we checked, prices for the PS5 were hovering just below $700.
If you've decided you simply can't wait another moment for Sony to get its act together and flood the market with inventory, eBay is a shortcut to getting your own PS5 right now. That said, let me reiterate our advice: No PS5 is worth spending hundreds over list price, and that's exactly what you'll have to do if you buy from an eBay reseller. The average PS5 price on eBay is about $900.

    It's like the Evercade handheld, but with multiplayer support and for your TV.
  

  Blaze
 
  Entertainment's
 Evercade handheld was an unexpected delight for fans of retro 
  gaming
. It was an affordable, well-built portable console with a solid library of classic 
  game
 collections that sold on wonderfully nostalgic game cartridges that went for just $20 apiece. It did, however, have one problem -- local multiplayer was impossible. To solve this issue, the company is releasing a home game console: the Evercade VS.
The Evercade VS is a lot like the handheld version, minus the screen and portability, but there are a few new features. For one, it has four USB ports, making four-player local multiplayer possible. It also has two cartridge ports and a menu system designed to show up to 40 
  games
 at once. In other words, if you plug in the Atari Lynx and Interplay game cartridges, all of the games from both collections will appear in the console's menu, side by side.
The portable and console Evercade systems both use the same cartridges, and the company says there are currently 280 games available for the platform across all game collections. Unfortunately, not every cartridge is fully compatible: Blaze told CNET the Namco collections are only licensed for the handheld, and won't work on the Evercade VS. The company says hopes to expand the license and make the games available on both platforms soon.
All future game collections will be available for both the handheld and VS system, the company says.
The Evercade VS will be available for preorder for $100 (roughly £72, AU$129) on May 28.

"Apple says Epic's Fortnite lawsuit is a marketing stunt to revive 'flagging interest' in the game","https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-says-epics-fortnite-lawsuit-is-a-marketing-stunt-to-revive-flagging-interest-in-the-game/","Thu, 08 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT","CNET","
    In dueling court filings, Apple details Epic's ""Project Liberty"" media strategy, while Epic argues the App Store forces up prices.
  
Apple and Epic have been dueling in a California court since August.

  Fortnite
 is one of the most popular games ever made and soon will be one of the most litigated.

  Apple
 on Thursday submitted its description of its souring relations with Fortnite developer Epic Games to the US District Court in California, where the two companies will square off in a trial starting next month. In its filing, the tech giant argues that after making more than $700 million in the two years since publishing Fortnite on the 
  iPhone's
 App Store, Epic hatched a plan to make even more -- and at Apple's expense.
In its description of events, Apple outlined a media strategy called Project Liberty that Epic allegedly planned with its lawyers and public relations firm for months as an effort to draw more attention to Fortnite last year. 
Last summer, Epic intentionally broke Apple's App Store policies that insist all digital products like Fortnite's victory poses, dance moves and new looks for characters be purchased through Apple's payment processing service. Apple then removed Fortnite from its App Store for violating the rules. Epic responded by filing a lawsuit in August and launching an ad campaign that went viral on social media.
""Epic just wants to free-ride on Apple's innovation,"" Apple said in its filing Thursday, arguing that Epic is using the lawsuit to ""revive flagging interest in Fortnite.""
An Epic spokeswoman declined to comment on the filing but noted that Epic has argued for fewer restrictions on Apple's App Store since at least 2017. And in a competing filing, Epic repeated its earlier arguments that Apple's App Store rules stifle innovation and that its commissions lead to higher prices for consumers.
For many people, the filings are the latest twist in a corporate slap fight between a multibillion-dollar company and a trillion-dollar company over who makes more money when a gamer spends money. But for Apple, this represents an existential threat to the iOS software and tools it's built up around its iPhone, one of the best-selling tech products ever. 
Apple's success has been driven in part by the App Store, a service Apple launched in 2008 offering developers a way to build special-purpose applications and games and then market them through Apple's centralized service. Apple takes a commission of up to 30% on digital items bought through those apps, a business model the company says is designed to offset the costs of running its store. The tech giant only allows people to download iPhone apps from its App Store, and any developer who doesn't agree to its terms is forced to create interactive websites instead.

  Google
 has similar but less restrictive rules for its Play Store, requiring developers who publish apps on its service to pay commissions on the sale of digital goods. Google also allows users to ""side load"" apps from other app stores, effectively downloading competitor platforms onto their devices, something Apple doesn't do. Still, the same day Epic broke Apple's app store rules it did the same with Google and was similarly kicked out of Google's Play Store. Epic is suing Google over Fortnite as well in a separate case.
In the 13 years since Apple's App Store launched, it's helped propel the iPhone to astronomical highs, with more than 1 billion handsets being actively used as of January. During last year's holiday season, which occurred at the end of a year roiled by the global coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic catastrophe, the iPhone helped Apple notch financial records. Its iPhone sales alone hit $65.6 billion, up 17% from a year prior.
The lawsuit, Apple says, is Epic's attempt to change the iPhone's business model. The company previously published emails in which Epic CEO Tim Sweeney asked Apple to allow alternative payment systems and download services, which would effectively let him set up his own app store on the iPhone. If a court forces such a change, industry watchers say it could fundamentally alter Apple's business, disrupting not just its finances but also the security and reliability the company's built around its tight control.
""Apple is among the most innovative, competitive, dynamic, and creative companies in the United States, and millions of people benefit from its products and services,"" Apple said in its filing. ""Those products and services are the result of billions of dollars of investment, in addition to substantial time and thought, and represent Apple's intellectual property.""
Until August 2020, Apple and Epic seemed to have a pretty good thing going. In 2018, Epic announced its popular game Fortnite would be made available for free to play on Apple's iPhones and 
  iPads
. Over the next two years, the companies raked in more than $1 billion in sales of optional looks and moves for characters. Then things unraveled when Epic attempted to circumvent Apple's payment rules, leading to Fortnite being banned from the App Store and now an upcoming antitrust trial.
Fortnite's become an internet phenomenon, in part because of its addictive gameplay and wacky characters.
Apple used swaths of its filing to argue against Epic's accusation that the iPhone and App Store rules constitute a monopoly. In its filing, Apple repeated earlier statements that it represents only a fraction of 
  phones
 used around the world and that many of the apps built for the iPhone can interact with apps on other platforms. Apple invoked an earlier Supreme Court ruling as well, writing that ""antitrust laws 'were enacted for the protection of competition, not competitors.'""
Epic argued in its filing that Apple's arguments for its App Store, citing improved security and reliability, are a smokescreen for what amounts to a business decision. ""Apple could easily implement security features to support open distribution on iOS without restricting app distribution to the App Store,"" the game company said in its filing. 
The company also argued that Apple's ability to detect malicious apps was ""limited,"" based on a deposition from an Apple executive overseeing fraud detection engineering. 
Epic also pointed to an internal case study Apple did of a fake ""virus scanning"" app. Apple's app review team initially rejected the program, which didn't actually scan for any viruses, twice before eventually allowing it onto the App Store. It then went on to charge unsuspecting customers $99 per week through Apple's payment processing system, quickly making it one of the top-grossing apps at the time. 
""Apple's restrictions on app distribution degrade the experience of consumers and developers,"" Epic added.
Apple didn't comment on the App Store study but pointed to statements in its filing noting that about 40% of apps submitted are rejected by the automated and manual review process, which includes close to 500 Apple employees around the globe. It also added that outside security firms have said little of the malware on the internet is targeted at Apple's software.
Epic lampooned Apple with a PR campaign shortly after filing its lawsuit, including by creating this ""Tart Tycoon"" Fortnite character with an apple head.
Perhaps the biggest reveal of the two filings was Apple's argument that Epic's moves were carefully coordinated and designed to force Apple and Google to either change their app store rules or look like the bad guys.
Apple's view into Project Liberty, as the plan was apparently called inside Epic, will likely include emails from executives as evidence, among other items. Apple also plans for CEO 
  Tim Cook
 to testify at the trial, along with other high-ranking Apple executives -- the audio of which will be livestreamed from the court to YouTube starting May 3.
""Epic is asking this Court to force alternative terms on Apple so that Epic can make more money,"" Apple said in its filing. ""But Epic's request would harm other developers and consumers, in addition to imposing unprecedented obligations on Apple to open its proprietary systems and engineering to third parties."""
