While graduate degrees can provide chances to pivot to new careers, they also can take a few years to complete and charge high tuition, depending on the school and program. That's why many people consider more affordable, flexible alternatives such as graduate certificates.
Here's everything you need to know about graduate certificates, how they compare to master's degrees, and some of the most popular graduate degree programs:
While not the same as a master's degree, a graduate certificate can be taken fully online, at your own pace, and for anywhere from $1,000-$5000 total. Depending on the intended profession, it can help you learn new skills to transition into a different field — with official certification to show employers on LinkedIn or your resume — and some options even have built-in portfolio assignments so you can exit the course with new samples of your work.
On some occasions, such as with edX MicroMasters and Coursera MasterTracks, graduate certificates can double as college credits towards a related master's degree, since you technically completed graduate coursework. However, certificate credits are not automatically accepted by all schools — it varies on the university and program.
 
On top of graduate certificates offered by universities, companies and non-profits sometimes offer professional certificate programs, which can also be added to resumes or LinkedIn profiles. Google and Udacity, for instance, offer programs designed to teach you in-demand tech skills such as data analysis, project management, and programming.
Unlike finishing a full master's degree program, grad certificate program students take a few master's courses around a subject — like Sustainability and Development or Data Science — and receive a certificate of completion upon passing the program. 
Because certificates involve taking fewer classes (and don't usually have an admissions process), they're not considered the same as having a master's degree or Ph.D. However, they can help you stand out to prospective employers, especially if you're looking to transition into a different field and want to demonstrate that you learned the required skills. 
Graduate certificate programs can cost anywhere from $1,000-$5,000, depending on the school, program, and length. The price of a graduate certificate can be a fraction of the cost of traditional college degrees (including online ones).
Graduate certificate programs widely vary in length. Some, like MIT's Supply Chain Management MicroMasters, can take a little over a year. Others, like the University of Minnesota's UX Design MasterTrack, take a few months to complete.
Most certificate programs, such as the ones offered through edX's MicroMasters, don't require a formal application process. If the course requires any prerequisite knowledge, that information will usually be in the course description.
That being said, graduate certificate programs, such as Coursera's MasterTracks, can cap off after a certain number of applicants, so it's good to bookmark the enrollment date and sign up as soon as you can.
Usually, no. Coursera and edX's graduate certificate offerings pick the classes for you and you have to pass all of them to get the certification.
There are exceptions, though. Harvard's Extension School, for instance, lets you choose a few electives as part of your certificate. 
While graduate degree programs operate via GPAs, graduate certificates are often Pass/Fail. Coursera, for example, gives you a percentage grade on each assignment and then a final combined score. 
Depending on the program and size of your class, your written feedback on assignments might also be shorter and more brief than it would be in a graduate degree program.
Specific programs in the edX MicroMasters and Coursera MasterTrack series have different guidelines regarding college credits. Some might only accept the certificate classes as college credits if you pursue a degree in the same school and program you completed the certificate in; others provide a list of schools that will take the credits.
One upside to completing a certificate before continuing a degree in the same field is that the certificate credits are typically cheaper and can save you some money down the line.
It depends. Coursera MasterTracks don't currently offer financial assistance. And while edX lets you apply for financial aid for most of its programs, for MicroMasters, you'll have to audit each course first and apply for financial aid every time. 
If you're looking to save time and money, graduate and professional certificates can be a great alternative to graduate degrees, especially if you're just looking to pick up some new skills, such as accounting or coding. Online certificate programs can also offer some flexibility in terms of scheduling and can help you decide if you want to pursue a full degree later. Here's a review of one Insider employee's positive experience taking a free University of Michigan Coursera MasterTrack course, which led her to apply to grad school.

"GameStop stock is 'extremely volatile' but can't be controlled: filing","https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-stock-extremely-volatile-executives-say-cant-be-controlled-2021-3","Sat, 27 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","GameStop said Tuesday that its stock is —and continues to be — ""extremely volatile."" 
Moreover, that volatility is ""due to numerous circumstances beyond our control.""
The statement in a regulatory filing is the first such statement from GameStop leadership on its ongoing stock price fiasco that's seen its shares rise as much as 1600% in a matter of weeks. 
Under the ""risk factors"" section of the annual report, the company's stock volatility is listed as the primary risk factor related to the company's stock. It specifically cites ""short squeezes"" as a primary reason for that volatility.
""The market price of our Class A Common Stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control,"" GameStop said in the filing. 
GameStop's stock value has been explosively unpredictable since mid-January. 
Between January 15 and January 27, the price leapt from around $35 to just shy of $350. It's seen similarly huge dropoffs, but months later it's still in the $180 range.
The reason, of course, is the much discussed ""short squeeze"" from a large group of individual investors driving up the company's stock price in an effort to defeat short sellers betting against the stock. It's been a major topic of discussion for the past several months for loads of people in media and on Wall Street — except for GameStop leadership.
The company has more or less stayed mum for weeks, and even declined to discuss it on its quarterly earnings call this past week. Instead company leadership focused on the company's ongoing ""transformation"" led by Chewy cofounder and former CEO Ryan Cohen.
Since Cohen joined the company's board in January, taking charge of a ""strategic"" committee soon after, the company made a string of high-profile hires from the likes of Amazon and Chewy.
It is unclear what Cohen's specific plans are the future of the company, but he broadly outlined plans in an open letter to the company's board in late 2020. 
GameStop, ""needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences,"" Cohen wrote in the letter, ""not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""

"How Ryan Cohen is transforming GameStop into the Amazon of video games","https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-ryan-cohen-amazon-chewy-revitalization-e-commerce-2021-3","Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","The co-founder and CEO who convinced Wall Street that pets are big business has a new pet project: Turning GameStop into the Amazon of gaming.
After taking a 12.9% stake last year through his investment firm RC Ventures, Cohen has made major changes at GameStop. First, he oversaw a string of c-suite departures and hirings. Then, he was appointed leader of a new committee overseeing a company-wide ""transformation."" Now, he's taking over the company's board.
A whopping eight board members are stepping down, GameStop said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. That leaves only Cohen, his former Chewy colleagues Jim Grube and Alan Attal, kindred spirit/activist investor Kurt Wolf, and current CEO George Sherman as board members.
From a board that currently has 13 members, the new GameStop board of directors will have just five. And at least four of those five members are working together: Cohen, Grube, Attal, and Wolf. 
Notably, former Nintendo of America president and well-known video game personality Reggie Fils-Aimé is among the board members stepping down in June. He lasted just over a year in the position.
As for the executive team, CEO George Sherman is the only remaining member from before Cohen got involved with the company. Jim Bell, the company's CFO, is said to have been pushed to resign by the company's board. Soon after, CCO Frank Hamlin resigned. 
Cohen openly criticized Sherman, his c-suite, and GameStop's directors in a letter to the board about the company's overall direction in late 2020.
Sherman, ""appears committed to a twentieth-century focus on physical stores and walk-in sales, despite the transition to an always-on digital world,"" Cohen said. He added that the board lacks ""the type of strategic vision"" necessary for GameStop, ""to pivot toward becoming a technology-driven business that excels in the gaming and digital experience worlds.""
In his letter, Cohen said the company, ""needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences — not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""
Since Cohen joined the company's board in January, taking charge of a ""strategic"" committee soon after, the company has made a string of high-profile hires from the likes of Amazon and — you guessed it — Chewy.
Cohen himself has kept quiet across the last several months.
He has repeatedly declined interview requests, and his Twitter timeline is primarily GIFs and images. His most recent tweet is a GIF from the movie ""Ted,"" of the titular character smoking a bong. On the most recent GameStop earnings call, Cohen did not appear.
Representatives for Cohen and GameStop did not respond to requests for comment as of publishing.

"We may never see another TV show like 'Game of Thrones' because of Netflix","https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-cant-be-replicated-2020-11","Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","HBO's massive hit ""Game of Thrones"" was very likely the last show of its kind.
The series dominated the global news cycle for months each year and drew tens of millions of concurrent viewers. In the nearly two years since the finale aired on May 27, 2019, entertainment reporters, audience analysts, and fans have all wondered whether the ""next 'Game of Thrones'"" is around the corner.
But it's clearer than ever that the void left by the series finale of ""Game of Thrones"" might never be filled.
Insider spoke with several TV creators at Netflix — HBO's competitor and the streaming service responsible for the new normal of ""binge watching"" whole seasons of a show at a time — to gauge whether its formula was capable of creating a similar fervor to the near-constant hype surrounding ""Game of Thrones.""
People like producer and director Shawn Levy, screenwriter and showrunner Carlton Cuse, and others we interviewed concluded that the unique set of circumstances which led to the wild success of ""Game of Thrones"" is unlikely to ever happen again, though perhaps it's not impossible.
The landscape of how TV is made and watched has changed drastically since ""Game of Thrones"" premiered. You can chart the shift into ""prestige TV"" and ""peak TV"" over the past 20 years by looking at a few key shows.
HBO's ""The Sopranos"" premiered in 1999, with ""The Wire"" on its heels in 2002. ABC's ""Lost"" first aired in 2004, leading to one of the first examples of a fervent, detail-obsessed TV fandom online. Then AMC's ""Mad Men"" and ""Breaking Bad"" came in 2007 and 2008, respectively, setting new standards for period TV and anti-hero dramas. 
""Game of Thrones"" premiered in 2011, and as the other shows were closing out their series' runs, the landscape of TV was changed when Netflix launched its binge-season format with ""House of Cards"" and ""Orange Is the New Black"" in 2013 (which happened to be the same year the famous ""Red Wedding"" episode of ""Game of Thrones"" catapulted the fantasy-drama into new heights of popularity).
By the time its sixth season was premiering in 2016, ""Game of Thrones"" was the last of these critically lauded, fan-obsessed dramas still commanding an audience of millions with a weekly episode format. Thanks to the unprecedented nature of the adaptation overtaking the books and spoiler culture, ""Game of Thrones"" was like having the Super Bowl air every Sunday for two months straight: If you didn't watch it live, you'd wake up and immediately know the score.
""Game of Thrones"" became essential appointment viewing for fans.
From the premiere of the ""Game of Thrones"" pilot to its series finale, the way people watch TV dramatically evolved. Gone are the days when weekly releases were the norm, and now binge-watching reigns supreme.
""It's something we have definitely talked about,"" Levy, who has worked on ""Stranger Things"" and ""Shadow and Bone,"" told Insider in February 2020. ""I think, with the exception of sporting events and political cataclysms, it is an increasingly rare thing for everybody to share the same viewing at the same time. I do think that that is a dying experience.""
But binge culture has a cost. Weekly releases help build engaged fandoms, which are a key part of the TV-watching experience. Fandoms not only help networks and streaming companies better understand their audience (which, in turn, helps those companies' bottom lines) but also create a sense of community — something people have been particularly craving during the COVID-19 pandemic.
When Netflix introduced the binge format in 2013, it dominated pop-culture conversations as people delighted in the ability to marathon a brand-new TV season in a single weekend (or even a day or two for adventurous watchers). But seven years later, the novelty of binge-watching has worn off. It can still make for a great individual experience, but that format can make it harder to develop hyperengaged TV show fandoms.
""As a writer, I prefer to be working in the streaming world,"" Meredith Averill, a cocreator of Netflix's ""Haunting of Hill House"" and ""Locke and Key,"" told Insider in an interview last year. ""As a viewer, I enjoy having shows that I have to wait every week to watch.""
She added: ""For me, I think it's exciting that there are so many different platforms now, but I hope that these week-to-week episodes never really goes away and it does leave room for there to be a 'Game of Thrones'-like series.""
Averill's cocreator on ""Locke and Key,"" Cuse, was also the cocreator of ABC's indelible mystery-drama series ""Lost."" 
""I think there is still something special about the week-to-week experience that I hope doesn't completely go away in the evolving television landscape,"" Cuse said. 
""It's great to have so many choices and so many amazing shows out there,"" Cuse added. ""But that ability to watch a show and have a conversation about it because everybody watched the episode the previous night — it's hard to do when people are watching things with different paces.""
Eric Heisserer, the showrunner of Netflix's new fantasy series ""Shadow and Bone,"" sees pros and cons in both formats of TV shows, especially ones that aren't based on books and therefore don't have a clear road map for fans to predict.
""I would say the disadvantage is when you're building out something that has a lot of mythology and a lot of extreme reveals, then that week between episodes gets filled with tons and tons of fan theories,"" Heisserer said. ""If your fans wind up being more imaginative than the people working the show, it can sour some things and be a bit of a problem area for you.""
Heisserer also said he believed that looking for the next ""Game of Thrones"" (or any show, for that matter) was a ""disservice"" to creators.
""In the earlier days, it was looking for the next 'Lost,' and then 'Game of Thrones' — anything that becomes a huge milestone for entertainment,"" Heisserer said. ""I've been in countless meetings with network execs saying that they are looking for the next blah, blah, blah. But as a creator, I think it's a scary kind of disservice to yourself and to your art to try and rise to that occasion.""
Heisserer said he preferred the approach of ""I'm going to be my own unique thing,"" and then it either catches on (which is ""great"") or he's left knowing he was true to each project and himself.
In a 2019 feature on HBO's then-president of programming Casey Bloys and the future of the network post-""Game of Thrones,"" Bloys told The Ringer that he's a ""huge, huge proponent of week-to-week viewing"" because of the conversations it drives.
""It's funny — when Netflix came out, I think the whole industry said, 'Oh my gosh, should we be doing this?'"" Bloys, who is now the chief content officer of HBO, told The Ringer. ""But I've come out very firmly on the side of a weekly release pattern.
He continued: ""You have an entire industry of people writing about TV and criticizing TV and obsessing about TV. To feed that once a week and to have people comment on it, and hate on it and love it is a lot … You want people talking about your shows. You want people debating your shows. You want people having an opinion of your shows.""
In 2019, Disney Plus' ""The Mandalorian"" came close to achieving the same success as ""Game of Thrones.""
Thanks in large part to Grogu, aka ""Baby Yoda,"" the show's weekly episode releases turned into events, with memes galore and a fervor for merchandise and theory swapping. The buildup between episodes as people waited eagerly to see more of Baby Yoda was palpable. 
Disney captured a similar energy with 2020's weekly drops of ""WandaVision,"" the first of many Marvel series to launch on the streaming service.
To Heisserer's point, the gaps between episodes in ""WandaVision"" (like with ""Game of Thrones"" and other mystery-box shows like ""Lost"" before it) gave people plenty of time online to come up with their own intricate fan theories about what was in store. The frenzy around theorizing led to disappointment for some once the finale aired.
Disappointments aside, it's impossible to deny the audience-grabbing power the weekly release schedule of ""WandaVision"" had.
During another phone call earlier this month, almost one year after our first conversation, Levy said his 2020 prediction about ""Game of Thrones"" being a ""dying experience"" may have come too soon.
""I'm the first to declare that I may very well have been wrong,"" Levy said. ""I don't know how you look at the Disney Plus model with 'WandaVision' and 'Falcon and the Winter Soldier' and all their series and not question that appointment television may not be dead after all.""
He added: ""I can tell you firsthand that the suspense and excitement that I felt gearing up to every Sunday last year waiting for the next episode of 'The Last Dance' on ESPN. It reminded me that there is indeed a different form of delight in waiting. And we've very much seen this, I think, with 'WandaVision' — there is something enjoyable about a cultural conversation that exists in real time and simultaneous time.
""Whereas with binge television, there's no lack of clips and ink devoted to it, but the conversation tends to be a little bit more sprawling because we're not talking about one episode on one day and the same day,"" Levy added.
Ultimately, streaming services and traditional networks are still experimenting with release formats.
A recent Hollywood Reporter feature on various streamers' approaches to scheduling pointed out that Netflix has been experimenting with weekly releases for reality shows like ""The Circle,"" while HBO Max did a ""batch"" release for some of its programming, like ""The Flight Attendant.""
""We are still in learning mode,"" Meredith Gertler, HBO Max's vice president of content strategy and planning, told the Hollywood Reporter. ""We are still experimenting with what works best for our subscribers. And we certainly don't believe the same rules apply necessarily across genre, so it is about taking more of a bespoke strategy that takes into account the creative and the nature of the programming.""
Given Disney Plus' weekly release strategy, and the continued success of HBO's weekly lineup, will Netflix eventually start experimenting with its own weekly drop of its prestige scripted shows? 
""I've certainly heard rumblings of conversation on that topic,"" Levy said. ""I have a lot of shows with Netflix, and I can't predict with certainty how things will be dropped or launched in the future. All I know is this: Three or four years ago, Netflix was famous for not disclosing rankings or viewership numbers, and we've seen the rule book get rewritten in real time. So I wouldn't assume that any rule is unbreakable.""

"GameStop names Jenna Owens COO, is second Amazon alum to join c-suite","https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-coo-amazon-fulfillment-jenna-owens-2021-3","Tue, 23 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","GameStop announced on Tuesday that it has hired a tech industry veteran to join its executive team.
Jenna Owens will be the company's new COO after spending four years at Amazon, according to her LinkedIn profile, and most recently serving as the director for Amazon's fulfillment operations. She also spent four years at Google and five months at the online clothing service Rent the Runway.
Read more: Ryan Cohen made millions when Chewy got acquired. Now the millennial entrepreneur has a plan to turn around GameStop.
The news comes the day GameStop reported its fourth-quarter earnings, the first since the company's stunning stock frenzy in January, and reported a $215 million loss for fiscal 2020. GameStop's stock has had a tumultuous few months after an online forum drove the company's stock price to sky-high levels, but Wedbush said the stock's value is, ""completely disconnected from the fundamentals of the business.""
GameStop's appointment of Owens to the c-suite role marks yet another recruitment from Amazon's talent pool. In February, GameStop named Matt Francis as CTO after he spent time as an engineering leader at Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud arm.

GameStop also announced on Tuesday that it hired Neda Pacifico as its new senior vice president of e-commerce. Pacifico spent over four years at Amazon, per the press release, but most recently comes from the pet supply delivery company Chewy, where she served as vice president of e-commerce.
Pacifico isn't the only Chewy alum involved in GameStop: Ryan Cohen cofounded the company and served as its CEO until 2018. Cohen is now the largest individual shareholder in GameStop, has joined the company's board of directors, and is determined to steer the company into a new era of digital gaming, one in which it could rival Amazon. Two other former Chewy execs — Alan Attal and Jim Grube — also sit on GameStop's board. 
Before the pandemic, GameStop had become a dying relic of the video game world as players turned to digital games instead of physical copies. But the COVID-19 pandemic gave the company a slight boost as people, cut off from traditional means of entertainment, sought ways to keep busy at home.

"Elon Musk's brain-chip company, Neuralink, released a video of a monkey playing video games with its mind","https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-neuralink-video-monkey-games-pong-brain-chip-2021-4","Fri, 09 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","Elon Musk finally got to show off his monkey.
Neuralink, a company founded by Musk that is developing artificial-intelligence-powered microchips to go in people's brains, released a video Thursday appearing to show a macaque using the tech to play video games, including ""Pong.""
Musk has boasted about Neuralink's tests on primates before, but this is the first time the company has put one on display. During a presentation in 2019, Musk said the company had enabled a monkey to ""control a computer with its brain.""
In August 2020 the company did a live demonstration of the technology in a pig named Gertrude.
Neuralink says the monkey, named Pager, had a chip implanted in his brain six weeks ago. In the video, he was given a joystick that was hooked up to a video game in which he moves a cursor to a colored square. When he successfully moves the cursor, he's given some banana smoothie through a tube.
While Pager uses the joystick, the Neuralink chip records his brain activity and sends it back to a computer for analysis of what his brain does when he moves his hand. The joystick is then unplugged from the machine, but the monkey continues to control the game, with brain signals being relayed by the Neuralink chips.
Theoretically, the same tech could be used to give people control of synthetic limbs via a Neuralink brain implant. In a tweet Thursday, Musk said the first Neuralink product would let people with paralysis control a smartphone.
Andrew Jackson, a neuroscience expert who is a professor at Newcastle University, told Insider that getting primates to control video games via neural interfaces was not new — comparable demonstrations were done in 2002 — but said it was a good test of the tech.
""If you invent a new telescope, it makes sense to first point it where you know what you will see,"" he said. ""So they are following a very sensible route to validate their device. I am sure this device will contribute to new scientific discoveries in future (especially if they make it widely available to scientists), as well as improving the usability of existing neural interface technologies for people with paralysis.""
Jackson added that the engineering of the device, being implanted wirelessly in Pager's skull, was a significant advance.
""What is definitely new and innovative is that there are no cables coming through the skin, and the brain signals are all being sent wirelessly,"" Jackson said. ""This to me is the advance here, and is important both for improving the safety of human applications (wires through the skin are a potential route for infection) and also as a way of improving the welfare of animals used in neuroscience studies. The Neuralink team has definitely made progress in this regard.""
Rylie Green, a bioengineering researcher at Imperial College London, also praised Pager's apparent welfare. ""The best thing I can see from that video is that the macaque is freely moving,"" she said. ""There's also no visible package connected to it. I would say that is definitely progress — not super innovative but a nice positive step forward.""

"'Game of Thrones': the 12 Biggest Changes Made to the Unaired Pilot","https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-differences-between-unaired-pilot-and-final-cut","Sat, 17 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","If you're out of the loop on what went wrong with the first pilot, you can read a deep dive on its creation here. But the bottom was that cocreators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss recieved a lot of key feedback after the first pilot episode was filmed, and then went back to the drawing board. 
For the first version of the pilot, Benioff and Weiss had hired director Tom McCarthy (who helmed Peter Dinklage's breakout film ""The Station Agent"") to be behind the camera.
McCarthy said he had ""very little"" impact on the look and feel of the pilot, and by the time Benioff and Weiss realized they needed to reshoot the bulk of it, McCarthy was busy with another project and unable to return for another run.
""I couldn't do it. And I just didn't feel connected to it,"" McCarthy told the AV Club in a 2011 interview. ""It wasn't a big decision. It felt right.""
And so McCarthy walked away, and Timothy Van Patten took over for reshoots of the pilot, and also directed the second episode of the debut season. 
The now-famous Emilia Clarke stepped in for ""Pride & Prejudice"" and ""The Tudors"" actress Tamzin Merchant. 
Until 2021, the reason for Merchant's departure was pure speculation. But she revealed a piece of the puzzle in an interview with Entertainment Weekly's James Hibberd.
""I didn't have any training as an actor. I only have my instincts,"" Merchant said. ""And what excites me and what drives me is a compelling story and a compelling character. So for me, 'Game of Thrones' was never that.""
Though Merchant didn't specify whether she was ultimately the one who asked to be removed from the show, or if that was a decision from HBO's creative team, the actress says she did try to ""back out"" of the contract before she filmed any scenes.
""I tried to back out of that situation and, during the contract process, I did back out,"" Merchant said. ""I was talked back into it by some persuasive people. Then I found myself naked and afraid in Morocco and riding a horse that was clearly much more excited to be there than I was.""
Ehle had decided to leave the project after reconsidering the lengthy time commitment.
Ser Waymar Royce is the lordling in charge of the Night's Watch ranging mission that opens the entire series. His character changed actors between pilot reshoots, from Jamie Campbell Bower to Rob Ostlere.
""David and Dan and HBO have decided to reshoot the prologue sequence from the pilot,"" Martin wrote on his blog in 2010. ""For the very best of reasons, I think: to make it better. I've seen the pilot, or at least a rough cut thereof, and I thought the prologue sequence was quite good, actually. But this will be the opening scene of the entire series, the first introduction to the world of Westeros for millions of viewers, so 'quite good' was not good enough. We want to make it great.""
Bower had landed a role on the Starz ""Camelot"" series by the time HBO needed to do reshoots, so Ostlere got the part instead.
Nearly a decade later, ""Camelot"" was long gone and HBO had made new casting announcements for the first ""Game of Thrones"" prequel series. One of the actors who landed a part was none other than Jamie Campbell Bower.
Unfortunately, that pilot was scrapped less than a year later, meaning Bower's chance at appearing in Westeros was once again lost to fate. 
 
 
We know the details of what changed between versions of the episode thanks to the Shavelson-Webb Library, where both a version of the original script from Benioff and Weiss and a new version (penned in 2010) are available for public perusal.
In broad strokes, the original pilot script pulls swaths of George R. R. Martin's first chapters of ""A Game of Thrones"" onto its pages, often word for word.
But the new version is a clear concession on Benioff and Weiss's behalf that some things don't translate straight from page to screen. They realized they needed to spoonfeed information to the audience and better explain the relationships between all of the characters and locations.
The original pilot opens precisely as Martin's first prologue chapter does, with three Night's Watch rangers (Ser Waymar Royce, Gared, and Will) beyond the Wall and already in the middle of tracking wildlings. However, the aired pilot begins with our three doomed rangers crossing beneath the Wall and beginning their journey north.
By showing Castle Black and the Wall right away, the cold open is given a better sense of location.
Another change came with the description of Will's discovery of the wildling corpses and the White Walkers themselves, referred to as ""Others"" in the first script but White Walkers in the final version. (Martin uses these terms interchangeably in the books.)
When Will sees the corpses in the final pilot, their bodies are mangled and arranged in a pattern, something Benioff and Weiss invented for the show. Their script indicates that this was a ""witchy mandala"" designed to send a message and show that the White Walkers were not mindless creatures. The change allows for Benioff and Weiss to establish that the White Walkers are sentient beings with a culture and purpose.
And both versions of the script make it clear that the White Walkers speak a language humans cannot understand. Again, this is something Martin alludes to in his books when the Other speaks and Will thinks the voice sounds ""like the cracking of ice on a winter lake.""
 
The first attempt at a pilot had a different opening credits sequence than the one we've come to know and love. Benioff and Weiss originally used a raven flying with a message as the opening, showing the bird soaring over various locations.
For the final pilot, Benioff and Weiss hired Angus Wall at the Santa Monica design firm Elastic to create the new opening credits sequence. 
Wall took this early idea of a raven flying over the various spotlight locations and re-imagined it as a digital camera's perspective with machinelike, da Vinci–esque inspirations. This is where we get the cogs of castles and sigils and the final shot of the astrolabe rotating around the sun with engravings that show the battle for the throne between the stag (Baratheon), lion (Lannister), wolf (Stark), and dragon (Targaryen).
By putting the map into an inverted sphere shape, the Elastic team was also helping Benioff and Weiss solve their challenge of properly establishing the geography of Westeros and Essos.
The small tweaks only increase from there. Many of the changes are centered around Benioff and Weiss making more room for expository dialogue, like adding in Ser Waymar Royce telling Will he'd be executed ""as a deserter"" if he abandons his post.
This happens again with the inclusion of a new opening Winterfell scene with Jon telling Bran that their father is watching the boys train, but specifically saying ""and your mother"" in order to tell audiences about Jon's bastardship.
Benioff and Weiss rearranged this whole section to better establish the Lannisters' rivalry with the Starks, with Jon Arryn's death being the inciting event that will bring the two families in closer proximity. Here we get more pointed dialogue that tells the audience about Cersei and Jaime's sibling relationship, as well as her marriage to King Robert.
The scene kicks off with a not-so-subtle line from Jaime as he walks up to Cersei and begins with: ""As your brother...""
Benioff and Weiss's writer friends (who had reviewed the first try at a pilot) had completely missed the sibling link between Cersei and Jaime for the first go-around, so they changed this scene's dialogue to make it extra clear that Cersei was married to the king, Jaime was her brother, and the two siblings had a secret big enough to get themselves killed if King Robert ever found out.
The copy of the 2010 script at the Writers Guild Foundation library has sections underlined by Benioff and Weiss to indicate where they planned on using old footage.
The first of these recycled scenes comes nearly twenty-two minutes into the aired pilot, where we see a raven flying toward Winterfell with a scroll tied to its leg.
Fun fact: In this scene, composer Ramin Djawadi used Littlefinger's theme music. The raven was carrying news of Jon Arryn's death — a murder orchestrated by Littlefinger. The use of Littlefinger's music was a nifty piece of foreshadowing since show-only fans wouldn't even meet his character until later in season one, nor learn of his involvement in Jon Arryn's death until season four. 
 
The second snippet of footage Benioff and Weiss managed to rescue from the first pilot is the shot of Bran climbing the walls of Winterfell and watching the king's party approaching the castle.
Once the travelers enter the Winterfell courtyard, we get another bout of added exposition in the final pilot version when Arya tells Sansa, ""That's Jaime Lannister, the queen's twin brother!"" as he takes off his helmet and looks around, and then later in the scene, she asks Sansa ""Where's the Imp?"" as a way for the episode to lead into Tyrion Lannister's introduction.
Tyrion's R-rated brothel scene features the sex worker named Ros, played by Esmé Bianco. Nearly ten years later, Bianco carries an earned pride for having one of the only scenes that wasn't axed after the first pilot's filming.
""I was originally just called 'the red-headed whore,'"" Bianco said during a spotlight panel at the second annual Con of Thrones in 2018. ""I didn't have a name at that point. And I was only meant to do this one scene with [Tyrion] ... and they reshot almost the entire pilot with the exception of my scene with Peter [Dinklage].""
You'll notice how Tyrion's hair is very blond and straight in this entire scene. In the books his hair is described as so blond ""it seemed white,"" and so Benioff and Weiss tried out a wig on Peter Dinklage for the first version of the pilot.
But by the final version, his natural hair was back. You can see his hair change back and forth within the pilot.
 
The other scenes saved from the first version of the pilot include Ned and Robert's conversations in the crypts. Sean Bean's hair looks a tad greasier in those original scenes, because the first go-around he had a different hairstyle.
You can see this greasier hair in the final pilot version during the feast at Winterfell when Ned speaks with both Benjen and Jaime.
 
The first run of the pilot's feast scene included Jaime and Ned talking about the Mad King, Aerys II Targaryen, and how he executed Rickard and Brandon Stark.
Instead of cramming this into the pilot, Benioff and Weiss moved the exchange to the third episode of the season, ""Lord Snow."" That way when Ned and Jaime speak bitterly of the Mad King and Ned's father in the throne room, it helps contextualize the events of Robert's Rebellion.
Given how much of the first season of ""Game of Thrones"" relies on an unfolding understanding of Robert's Rebellion and the way it impacted our various lead characters (Ned, Cersei, Jaime, Catelyn, and Littlefinger, to name just a few), it's no surprise that Benioff and Weiss first tested out the possibility of using flashback scenes.
One of the most legendary aspects of the unseen pilot is a flashback scene that showed Ned's father and brother killed on the orders of the Mad King. A small flash of this scene made it into at least one of the early ""Game of Thrones"" promotional trailers released by HBO.
In the footage, which lasts barely a second, a man who looks an awful lot like Ned Stark is struggling against a rope tied around his neck. Blood covers his face, and he's clearly in anguish. In the blurred background of the shot we can see the Iron Throne and a blond king upon it.
Author George R.R. Martin had made a cameo in the original version of this scene, which was filmed in Morocco. But the whole section, and therefore his cameo, was axed.
""It was, sad to say, left on the cutting-room floor,"" Martin said in a Daily Beast interview ahead of the first season premiere. ""It was during Daenerys' wedding and I was a Pentoshi nobleman in the background, wearing a gigantic hat.""
Though Benioff and Weiss planned on making it up to Martin by incorporating a new cameo into the fourth season, the appearance never happened.
Dany's whole wedding night was changed significantly from the books. Last year, George R. R. Martin said that the decision to have Daenerys sexually assaulted on her wedding night made the scene ""worse"" — but the reason for that change makes sense if you've read the books.

"See how the 'Game of Thrones' characters changed from the pilot episode all the way to the series finale","https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-much-the-game-of-thrones-characters-have-changed-since-season-1-2016-6","Thu, 15 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT","Business Insider","He was raised believing he was the bastard son of Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and Warden of the North.
Jon volunteered to ""take the black"" and join the Night's Watch after Eddard Stark was named the Hand of the King.
Over the course of seven seasons, Jon rose to prominence and became Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, was assassinated by his own men, resurrected by the red priestess Melisandre, fought to take back Winterfell, and crowned King in the North.
In season eight, he renounced his title after bending the knee to Queen Daenerys Targaryen, and helped lead the fight against the Night King and Army of the Dead. 
But then Jon killed Daenerys, distraught over her intentions to rule all of Westeros and the world at the cost of innocent lives. In the final scene of ""Game of Thrones,"" Jon went Beyond the Wall to presumably live among the wildlings in exile for the rest of his life.
During one fateful climb, he accidentally witnessed Jaime and Cersei Lannister committing both incest and adultery, and was pushed from the top of a tower. When he woke from his coma, Bran had lost the use of both his legs.
After calling himself the Three-Eyed Raven and using his greenseeing abilities to see into the past, present, and maybe even future, Bran reclaimed his name as a king. 
In the series finale, Tyrion proclaimed Bran Stark to be the most logical ruler for the remaining six kingdoms of Westeros, and he was crowned King. 
Sansa, the eldest daughter of Eddard and Catelyn Stark, adored love stories and longed to leave Winterfell for the excitement of the capital in the south.
She was eager to marry Prince Joffrey, and follow the path of a highborn girl just as her parents had raised her to do.
After the harsh reality of King's Landing, two arranged marriages, and countless acts of violence and abuse levied against her, Sansa managed to retake Winterfell and have both Ramsay Bolton and Littlefinger killed. 
Now she's the Queen in the North, having successfully won the independence of her homeland following the brutal war against the Night King and Cersei. 
For her coronation, Sansa wore a stunning gown with six key references to her family and past woven into it. 
While Sansa dreamed of fairy tales and embroidery, Arya preferred archery and combat. She was gifted a sword, Needle, by Jon Snow and taught to fight after Ned Stark finally caved to her wishes.
Arya was forced to grow up quickly following Ned's death and her escape from King's Landing. She traveled undercover, eventually went to Braavos to hone her murder skills, and returned to Winterfell.
Arya was the one who finally killed the Night King, defeating the White Walkers once and for all. In the series finale, she set sail for the unknown lands to the west of Westeros, ready for a new adventure.
Derisively called ""The Imp"" by those who didn't respect him, Tyrion identified himself as someone with a fondness for ""cripples, bastards, and broken things."" He tried to make friends in places where the rest of his family would only see foes.  
After being wrongfully accused of murder and sentenced to death by Tywin Lannister, Tyrion killed his father and fled Westeros to go team up up with Daenerys.
He was trying to help Daenerys save the realm and then claim her place as Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, but his plans failed again and again until the kingdom was once again in disarray and Daenerys was dead. 
Now Tyrion is living out his days trying to fix the mess he helped make by serving as Hand of the King once more.
 She was raised to believe her brother Viserys was the rightful heir to the Iron Throne, but they had been exiled after King Robert's rebellion.
The young Daenerys spent season one gaining more autonomy and learning how to rule as the Khaleesi of a great Dothraki tribe led by Khal Drogo.
Daenerys underwent many phases of growth as she conquered cities in Essos and acquired her army of Unsullied and Dothraki bloodriders. 
But before she could take the Seven Kingdoms, Daenerys turned her sights north to help Jon Snow fight the Army of the Dead. Once that battle was won, Dany wound up attacking King's Landing with full force, destroying swaths of the city and killing civilians along the way.
Jon Snow murdered her in the Red Keep, convinced she was too dangerous a ruler to live anymore. 
Like Dany, all the other characters from the ""Game of Thrones"" pilot met their deaths by the time the credits rolled on the HBO hit series. To see the lucky ones who survived, including a few you probably forgot about, read our list here.
