Billionaire tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC on Wednesday that he closed out his position in GameStop, one day after joining the trading frenzy around the video game retailer.
Palihapitiya also defended the power of individual investors to compete with Wall Street hedge funds.
The CEO of Social Capital and former Facebook executive tweeted Tuesday that he bought $125,000 worth of February $115 GameStop call options after asking his followers on Twitter what to buy. Calls are derivatives that give the buyer the right to purchase a stock at a set price. The trader makes money when the stock rises above the strike price. GameStop stock opened Wednesday at $354 per share, up more than 1,550% this year alone.
Wednesday on CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report,"" Palihapitiya said, ""I ended up closing out my position this morning, and I wanted to announce that I'm taking all the profits that I made plus my original position — I'm going to take $500,000 and I'm going to donate it.""
Palihapitiya dismissed Wall Street criticism about how individual investors are banding together on social media — particularly the wallstreetbets Reddit message board, and short-squeezing GameStop and a handful of other stocks like pros — as hypocritical. He said hedge funds try to push stocks around all the time.
Allowing hedge funds to go short 140% of GameStop shares could be seen as irresponsible, he said. ""To a normal person that doesn't make any sense. But to a Wall Street mathematician, that's the game that's been played. And that game came undone.""
Shares of GameStop initially jumped earlier this month after the company said that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen was joining its board. As buyers plowed into the stock, shorts were sent running for the hills.
A short squeeze happens when a stock with a large bloc of short sellers starts to increase in price, and shorts scramble to buy shares at the current higher prices to limit their losses. They return the number of borrowed shares and lose the price difference.
Palihapitiya said the craze around GameStop shares, and a few other stocks like AMC Entertainment, is much more than just a trading story, arguing it's a pushback against the establishment.
""Instead of having 'idea dinners' or quiet whispered conversations amongst hedge funds in the Hamptons these kids have the courage to do it transparently in a forum,"" he said. ""What it proves is this retail [investor] phenomenon is here to stay. There are 2.7 million people inside wallstreetbets. I think they are as important as any hedge or collection of hedge funds.""
Palihapitiya said the best research on stocks done by retail investors inside wallstreetbets is nearly indistinguishable from the best research on Wall Street. ""That edge is gone. Now all of a sudden, retail can be on the same footing and they don't have to be the 'bag holder' to Wall Street.""
A veteran venture capitalist, Palihapitiya has had success lately sponsoring SPACs, blank-check special purpose acquisition companies. One of his SPACs completed its merger with Virgin Galactic in October 2019, allowing Richard Branson's space tourism venture to become a publicly traded company. That stock has gained more than 115% in 2021.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren lambasted the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday for the regulator's failure to take action after a dayslong blitz of market speculation.
""We need an SEC that has clear rules about market manipulation and then has the backbone to get in and enforce those rules,"" Warren said. ""To have a healthy stock market, you've got to have a cop on the beat.""
""That should be the SEC,"" she added. ""They need to step up and do their job.""
The SEC did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.
The Massachusetts Democrat joined CNBC after wild stock moves prompted popular trading app Robinhood to restrict access to the high-flying names at the center of the controversy.
Warren, a longtime critic of Wall Street, spoke to CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" as individual traders took to Reddit, Twitter and other social media platforms to protest Robinhood's move to curb trading in stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment.
But Warren made clear that she isn't a big fan of Robinhood, either.
Robinhood and similar firms, which offer incentives to join while forcing customers to sign arbitration clauses, don't help create healthy market conditions, she said.
Those arbitration clauses, she said, protect Robinhood ""if it turns out that [it] really did cheat you. It'll never be made public, there will be very little that you can do about.""
The public outrage toward Robinhood came after the California-based brokerage announced earlier on Thursday that it would bar customers from buying additional shares of companies including GameStop and move theater operator AMC Entertainment. It still allows customers to sell those stocks from their current portfolio.
Robinhood announced soon after Warren's interview that it will allow a limited amount of trading in those volatile stocks on Friday.
Investors on the irreverent WallStreetBets Reddit led an effort to ""squeeze"" short sellers to cover their bets in such stocks and, as a result, have sparked a frenzy of volatile trading in recent sessions. Many of those retail investors sparked the short squeeze through Robinhood's popular trading app.
Video game retailer GameStop is up about 200% so far this week, AMC has risen 145% and headphone maker Koss, another ""squeeze"" target, has surged a whopping 1,100%.
Robinhood's decision, which it says was motivated by ""extraordinary volatility in the markets,"" sparked criticism from both sides of the political aisle.
For her part, Warren said she is skeptical of a narrative that would relate the current trading to a classic ""David versus Goliath"" story that pits a scrappy group of retail investors against a colossal, hedge fund empire.
""That's the problem: How do you know who's manipulating the stock at this point?"" she asked. ""Are you entirely sure that there aren't wealthy people on both sides? That hedge funds haven't moved in on the side of the people who bid up the price of GameStop?""
Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a progressive who represents Silicon Valley, called for ""more regulation and equality"" and questioned the fairness of preventing individuals from buying.
""While retail trading in some cases, like on Robinhood, blocked the purchasing of GameStop, hedge funds were still allowed to trade the stock,"" Khanna said.
By buying GameStop or AMC equity or call options, retail investors have forced investors betting against the stock, known as short sellers and oftentimes hedge funds, to cover their positions by buying back shares in an effort prevent further losses.
When this occurs en masse, it can lead to a feedback cycle and a spike in a stock's price.

Melvin Capital closed out its short position in GameStop on Tuesday afternoon after taking a huge loss, the hedge fund's manager told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.
GameStop, hedge funds' most-hated stock, was targeted by an army of retail investors who marshaled forces against short sellers in online chat rooms. In the Reddit forum ""wallstreetbets"" with more than 2 million subscribers, rookie investors encouraged each other to pile into GameStop's shares and call options, creating massive short squeezes in the stock.
CNBC could not confirm the amount of losses Melvin Capital took on the short position. Citadel and Point72 have infused close to $3 billion into Gabe Plotkin's hedge fund to shore up its finances. On Wednesday's ""Squawk Box,"" Sorkin said Plotkin told him that speculation about a bankruptcy filing is false.
GameStop shares have soared more than 400% this week alone to $347.51 apiece, driving its January gains to 685%. The stock was worth just $6 four months ago.
Shares of the brick-and-mortar video game retailer popped another 134% on Wednesday, pushing the company's market cap to $24 billion.
GameStop was the single most traded name in the U.S. stock market on Tuesday, topping Tesla and Apple, even though they are 81 and 233 times larger in market cap terms, according to Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid.
Amid GameStop's explosive rally, short sellers have accumulated losses of more than $5 billion year to date in the stock, including a loss of $917 million on Monday and $1.6 billion on Friday, according to data from S3 Partners.
Short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research said Wednesday he has covered the majority of his short position in GameStop at a loss. He previously said GameStop will fall back to $20 a share ""fast"" and called out attacks from the ""angry mob"" that owns the stock.
Investor Michael Burry said in a now-deleted tweet Tuesday that trading in GameStop is ""unnatural, insane, and dangerous"" and there should be ""legal and regulatory repercussions."" Burry shot to fame by betting against the housing bubble and was featured in Michael Lewis' book ""The Big Short.""
The Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment.
Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya is among those who jumped into the stock, saying in a Tuesday tweet that he bought GameStop call options betting the stock will go higher. His tweet seemed to intensify the rally in the previous session. The stock ended the day 92% higher at $147.98.
After Tuesday's closing bell, Elon Musk commented on the mania, linking it to the ""wallstreetbets"" Reddit chat room. The Tesla CEO tweeted to his 42 million followers ""Gamestonk!!"" The comment appeared to help send GameStop shares soaring in extended trading Tuesday.

Reddit users and other retail investors who piled into GameStop stock aimed to take down Wall Street.
Pension funds, which support ordinary Americans in retirement, may be an unintended casualty.
Some hedge funds have sustained big losses as a result of bets against GameStop stock. Melvin Capital, for example, lost more than 50% in January.
But pension plans — which invest assets on behalf of workers like teachers and police officers — may hold big positions in hedge funds. That means a financial hit for hedge funds could spill over to workers' retirement assets.
""Your 'eat the rich' mentality just took a bite out of the pension funds of working Americans,"" Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said of GameStop investors who targeted Wall Street

""It's not a victimless game, and it's not a Wall Street billionaire who's going to ultimately pay the price,"" Roper added.
Roughly 7% of the $4.5 trillion in state and local pension plans are allocated to hedge funds, according to data published by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College and the Center for State and Local Government Excellence. These plans (which don't include plans in the private sector) support 14.7 million workers and 11.2 million retirees.
But many pensions allocate much more, some even north of 20% of their overall portfolio, according to Pensions & Investments.
The top four by overall portfolio share are: The Directors Guild of America-Producer Pension Plans (23%), Eli Lilly & Co. (28%), the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund (30%) and Eastman Kodak Co. (41%), according to P&I, which surveyed the 1,000 largest pension plans about their investments as of September 2019. (The company is publishing 2020 data next week.)  
The California State Teachers' Retirement System, State of Michigan Retirement Systems and Virginia Retirement System held the largest hedge-fund investments on a dollar basis: $14 billion, $12 billion and $11 billion, respectively, according to P&I. However, those holdings made up less of their overall portfolio relative to other investments (5.8%, 16.3% and 13.2%, respectively).
Of course, pensions with large hedge-fund holdings didn't necessarily lose money. Those that did bet against GameStop and other stocks like AMC Entertainment and Bed Bath & Beyond.
Hedge funds commonly employ a tactic called ""short selling,"" which makes them money when a stock's price falls. Retail investors targeted shares in GameStop and other companies heavily shorted by Wall Street in recent weeks — driving up the stock price and causing staggering losses in some hedge funds.
Shares of GameStop were up 400% last week, bringing the stock's total gain to 1,625% this year. (Shares fell sharply on Monday.)
Losses for some hedge funds — like Candlestick Capital Management, Citron Capital, D1 Capital Partners, Maplelane Capital, Melvin Capital and Point72 — extended into the double digits.
""It absolutely has a ripple effect,"" Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, said of hedge-fund woes extending to pensions. ""When these types of things start to happen, it's not like you can target it to this one firm or fund that'll be hurt.
""There's absolutely collateral damage,"" he added.
Many plans aimed to increase their allocations to hedge funds and other alternative assets in 2020 to try boosting returns amid lower relative yields from safer assets like cash and bonds.

Janel Meehan doesn't want her children to grow up like she did, not knowing much about money.
So every chance she gets, she incorporates financial lessons into their lives — including during her 11-year-old son's video games.
""My parents never talked to us about money,"" the 45-year-old said. ""I made all the mistakes.""
One of her son's favorite games is Animal Crossing, which he plays on the Nintendo Switch that he saved up for and bought with his own money.
In the game, players upgrade their homes and pay off debt by doing various things, such as selling fish or weeds. Meehan spoke with him about it and what it means to take out loans — and how they have to be paid back.
""He's learned that doing work equals money,"" said Meehan, who lives with her husband and two children in San Diego.
He also saw that the price of turnips changed from day to day, which sparked a discussion on commodities and the stock market.
It turns out Meehan is onto something. Using games to teach about money can make learning fun.
""Studies have shown that children learn best when engaged and active,"" said Stephanie W. Mackara, president and principal wealth advisor of Charleston Investment Advisors, based in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina. She's also the author of the book, ""Money Minded Families.""
""Concepts learned in games help children understand cause and effect, make mistakes and get rewarded for smart choices.""
It also helps broach a subject that has too often has been seen as taboo.
""It is about just giving kids a comfort level with talking about money,"" said certified financial planner Tom Henske, a partner at New York-based Lenox Advisors.

It also gets parents more comfortable with discussing the topic, as well.
Of course, children don't have to go it alone. An adult should guide them along, helping to explain concepts and the impact of their choices.
Here are some ways to make financial concepts entertaining.
The first game that likely comes to mind when it comes to financial concepts is Hasbro's Monopoly. The board game has players buying and trading properties, developing them, collecting rent and trying to force their opponents into bankruptcy.
There is even a version for younger kids, Monopoly Jr., which Devon Scheitrum's 5-year-old son, Wolfgang, got for Christmas.
""It's reinforcing basic math while also teaching him about budgeting and preferences,"" said Scheitrum, who is 36 and lives in Tucson, Arizona.
""It's neat seeing him connect early math with real world-ish concepts.""
You have your pick of board games to introduce money lessons to your kinds, including:
For San Diego native Christina McClurg Riehl, Cashflow is her go-to game. Developed by ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"" author Richard Kiyosaki, the game focuses on creating passive income.
Riehl, a 44-year-old civil rights attorney, and her husband started playing it with their three boys, ages 9, 11 and 13, after the pandemic struck. She was hoping to give them some experiences they weren't getting through school.
""We saw this as an opportunity to teach some of those skills that my husband and I both wish we understood earlier,"" Riehl said.
""We are trying to change that narrative with our kids and we are trying to figure out ways to do it without lecturing them.""
There are a number of free games available online that can help make learning about money fun.
For instance, Visa and the National Football League teamed up to create Financial Football, an interactive game that teaches players money management skills.
The U.S. Mint also has a number of free games available on its H.I.P. Pocket Change Kids site, including coin memory match, math jam and space supply.
Younger kids may have fun with Peter Pig's Money Counter, while older kids may want to try their hand at the SIFMA Foundation's stock market game.
Apps like Savings Spree, Renegade Buggies, and Bankaroo also teach about financial responsibility, Mackara pointed out. Henske likes T. Rowe Price's Star Banks Adventure app.
The Washington State Department of Financial Institutions also has a list of online and app options to choose from.
Young children can learn about the different coin values by sorting change. You can also create a race by giving your kids a large pile of pennies and a minute to neatly stack then. The one with the largest stack wins.
Once they know the coin names and values, you can play Collect 25 Cents. The rules are simple: Roll the die, and collect the number you get in coins. The first one who amasses enough to add up to a quarter wins.
You can also collect a half dollar and dollar. Virginia's Department of Education lays out on its website the rules for a similar game, called Race to a Dollar!
For kids who like to pretend play, you can get play money or a a pretend cash register. You can play store or be the customer at your child's cafe, for instance.
By making money lessons fun, it can help children escape the victim's mentality that many people have around money, Henske said.
""It is giving them the understanding that they can make decisions and they can have power over their financial lives,"" he said.

The astronomical rally in GameStop has imposed huge losses of nearly $20 billion for short sellers this month, but they are not budging.
Short-selling hedge funds have suffered a mark-to-market loss of $19.75 billion year to date in the brick-and-mortar video game retailer, including a nearly $8 billion loss on Friday as the stock kept ripping higher, according to data from S3 Partners.
Still, short sellers mostly are holding onto their bearish positions or they are being replaced by new hedge funds willing to bet against the stock. GameStop shares that have been borrowed and sold short have declined by just about 5 million over the last week, marking an 8% dip in the short interest, according to S3. Most of the short covering occurred on Thursday, when the stock fell for the first time in six days.
""I keep hearing that 'most of the GME shorts have covered' — totally untrue,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3 managing director of predictive analytics. ""In actuality the data shows that total net shares shorted hasn't moved all that much.""
""While the 'value shorts' that were in GME earlier have been squeezed, most of the borrowed shares that were returned on the back of the buy to covers were shorted by new momentum shorts in the name,"" Dusaniwsky added in an email.
Shares of GameStop, along with other heavily shorted stocks, spiked once again Friday, after Robinhood said it was resuming limited trading of previously restricted securities. The gain pushed GameStop's rally this week to over 400% and this month to more than 1,600%.
The video game stock has been the star of the show on the WallStreetBets Reddit forum, whose membership has grown rapidly to over 5 million. A wave of day traders continued to encourage each other to pile into GameStop's shares and call options, creating a massive short squeeze that inflicted pain for hedge funds betting against the stock.
The borrow fee on GameStop's stock — or the cost-to-borrow shares for the purpose of selling them short — jumped to 29.32% on existing shorts and 50% on new short positions, S3 said.
""If most of the shorts had covered, we would not be seeing stock borrow rates at these high levels — by now you would be able to borrow GME stock at single digit levels due to an increase in the lendable stock loan supply due to borrowed shares being returned after all the 'supposed' buy-to-covers,"" Dusaniwsky said.
GameStop remained the most-shorted name in the market as short interest as a percentage of shares available for trading stands at 113.31%, S3 said.
Short selling is a strategy in which investors borrow shares of a stock at a certain price in expectations that the market value will fall below that level when it's time to pay for the borrowed shares.

A look at the 10 most-purchased stocks by retail traders during the market mania last month is missing one key stock: GameStop.
AMC Entertainment and Plug Power, two names caught up in the trading frenzy along with GameStop, were popular buys among retail investors, JPMorgan found, yet the brick-and-mortar video game retailer that seemingly put Wall Street on its heels is notably absent from the list.
The prevailing narrative was that a band of Reddit-inspired small traders rose up against Wall Street by buying GameStop en masse, forcing a short squeeze by professional hedge fund managers, who were forced to cover their negative bets or risk catastrophic losses.
But several signs are pointing to institutional investors as big drivers of the wild price action on the way up.
""Although retail buying was portrayed as the main driver of the extreme price rally experienced by some stocks, the actual picture may be much more nuanced,"" JPMorgan global quantitative and derivatives strategy analyst Peng Cheng told clients in a note. JPMorgan's quant team uses public data from exchanges and applies a proprietary methodology to identify which flows are from retail traders. GameStop was number 15 on the firm's retail buying list for January.
The rookie investor ""vigilantes"" grabbed the most attention by being all over social media, posting screenshots of their positions and crucifying Robinhood and other brokers when the firms were forced to limit trading in the high-flying names. The membership of Reddit group WallStreetBets has rocketed to 8.5 million subscribers.
However, it's possible the noise from this crowd caused most to overlook Wall Street co-opting this trade to make a fast buck as well, data shows.
""Maybe it's not as much of just the little guy versus the big guy,"" said JMP Securities analyst Devin Ryan. ""I think that it's reasonable to say that institutional investors were also very active in those stocks last week because there are institutional investors that participate in names that have elevated volume. I think most likely that was also expressed in some of the options activity last week as well.""
Retail investors were actually net sellers of GameStop from Tuesday through Thursday last week, according to data from Citadel Securities.
""What was going on in the stocks forced the hedge funds to trade to cover, or they might have been playing, too, to win,"" said Piper Sandler analyst Richard Repetto. ""There always could be the hedge fund that was totally uninvolved, wasn't short, but saw what was going and said this might be a way that I can profit just by going long.""
New York-based hedge fund Senvest Management reportedly made $700 million off of the GameStop mania, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.
Another proxy for retail trading, Trade Reporting Facility volumes, showed that retail investing decreased significantly after Tuesday of last week. The volumes are basically all the trades that aren't executed on the exchanges. So, what goes into that TRF is normally the vast majority of all the retail volume.
Retail trading volumes were near record highs at 50% on Tuesday of last week, but dropped off more than 5% the next day, signaling a decrease in individual investing in what was the thick of the Reddit mania.
""If this was just retail doing everything, that percentage would have stayed the same, if not gone up,"" said Repetto. Hedges might have been ""riding the wave and trying to benefit, too,"" he added.
Trading restrictions by brokers like Robinhood and Interactive Brokers on certain securities starting Thursday of last week could have contributed to the drop in trading that day and last Friday.
A David and Goliath narrative transpired last week between the social media crazed Reddit traders and the major hedge funds shorting stocks like GameStop.
However, some investors, including short-seller Carson Block, theorized that the battle royale was Wall Street vs. Wall Street.
Last week, UBS' Art Cashin, who has seen short-squeeze battles play out before, suspected something more was at play than just rookie investors.
""I … have some suspicions that it is not a democratization. I'm not sure that everything you're reading is coming from the little guy, the public,"" Cashin told CNBC last week. ""I think there may be some big professionals in there that want to turn the crowd into a mob and get them to attack the hedge funds by buying this.""
University of Chicago law professor Todd Henderson, whose research specializes in corporations, securities regulation, and law and economics, thinks hedge funds were the driving force of GameStop's meteoritic rise.
""I know people are hung up on Reddit and the little guy sort of teaming up on the big guys. ... I think this was just big guys teaming up on big guys,"" Henderson said during a webinar on Tuesday.
Henderson theorizes that hedge funds purchase a bundle of shares that would have otherwise been loaned out freely to short sellers and bought them back from the short-sellers. This created fewer shares for short sellers to borrow in the market, and that squeezed the number of possible shares available to be loaned, making it harder for short sellers to bet against the stock. The desperate short-sellers needed to find new shares to borrow but supply got constricted.
""All of that price inflation was likely driven by vindictive hedge funds trying to squeeze out a hedge fund that was short GameStop,"" said Henderson.
While the GameStop bubble is popping this week, with the shares down more than 80%, regulators in Washington are not forgetting about last week's drama.
Both houses of Congress are planning to hold hearings regarding the GameStop mania and newly appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she will be meeting with the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve Board, the New York Fed and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission to discuss ""whether recent activities are consistent with investor protection and fair and efficient markets.""
""Regulators want to get to the bottom of what exactly occurred last week,"" said Ryan. ""One response will be for regulators to look into exactly how this occurred and whether there were bad actors with bad intentions mixed in with people that were just looking for information and were taking part in a trade they were enthusiastic about.""
SEC regulators are reportedly combing through Reddit posts to identify if there were any bad actors trying to manipulate the market last week, according to Bloomberg News. The regulatory agency is also investigating the possibility of bots playing a role in the mob.
""We're kind of in this unprecedented time where the power of social media has really taken on a new meaning,"" said Ryan. ""I think that gives people a new voice and overall information is powerful, but with that there needs to be some understanding about how that information is being used.""
Tony Casey, also of the University of Chicago, contends that hedge funds piggybacked on Reddit traders to ride the GameStop wave. He said the ""knee jerk"" regulatory action could have risked causing an adverse effect. With emotions running high, Casey said the hearings in Washington could be ""dangerous"" if legislators rush to judgment about regulating retail investing, brokers or hedge funds.
""People have been calling for the regulation of retail trade for a long time. Normally you do it when traders obviously lost. ... You can't have rules that you're going to let retail investors make bad decisions when they lose the bet but we're going to regulate them when big funds lose the bet,"" Casey said during the same webinar. ""That would be a political disaster.""
Regardless of where regulators decide to point the finger, Repetto expects hedge funds will look more carefully at the stocks they are shorting, avoiding names with a very high percentage of the float tied up in short interest.

"The psychology of the GameStop phenomenon, explained","https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/30/psychology-of-gamestop-stock-phenomenon.html","Sat, 30 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT","CNBC","
By now, there's a good chance you've heard what's been happening with GameStop's stock surge. Majorly simplified: Everyman retail investors are using Reddit to spread the word and help boost the stock price of video game retailer GameStop (as well as some others), causing a few Wall Street hedge funds that had heavily shorted the stock to lose millions.
The Reddit crew are essentially ""playing the metagame"" — a term used in role-play video games when players strategize outside of the rules of the game, says Joost van Dreunen, who teaches the business of video games at the NYU Stern School of Business.
""Retail investors do the same thing,"" van Dreunen says. ""It has nothing to do with the fundamentals of the actual GameStop company, they're just playing the financial metagame.""
And the world can't look away. So what are the psychological reasons behind the phenomenon? Here, experts offer potential explanations.
The narrative many are promoting about the GameStop frenzy is that small retail investors are sticking it to ""big evil Wall Street,"" says Kelly Shue, professor of finance at the Yale School of Management. 
Though that's not what is actually happening, the story is applealing because there is a lot of pent up anger and frustration around the power structure that the financial industry perpetuates, says Sarah Newcomb, director of behavioral science at investment research firm Morningstar.
Some users of WallStreetBets (the subreddit community that helped trigger the GameStop surge) describe the pain that they and their families endured during the 2008 financial crisis and highlight how professional investors were never punished, Shue says.
""It hasn't really escaped anyone that over the last decade or so, there's been this persistent favoring favoritism towards large institution financial institutions at the expense of everyone else,"" van Dreunen says.
So, it's not surprising that this has turned into a ""rallying cry for the little guy,"" Newcomb says. ""The problem is the little guy is probably still going to get squashed in this situation.""
""I think there is a cultural and kind of class element to this,"" Shue says.
As one Reddit user wrote on the subreddit WallStreetBets: ""For the past two weeks, the pro-GameStop investors have shown great interest in the potential turnaround story of a store that plays a big role in their childhood memories.""
GameStop is a brick-and-mortar retailer that many young people grew up with, but that had been declining in recent years. ""GameStop is sort of written off"" as something that can't compete with Amazon, van Dreunen says. (Other stocks that were targeted include BlackBerry, Blockbuster and Nokia.)
So ""[n]ostalgia becomes a reason to do these things,"" digital culture expert Jamie Cohen told Time. ""They see this as like the last gasp of a troll. You can't save a GameStop, you can't probably save Blockbuster, but what you could do is kind of play around with it before it expires.""
That kind of nostalgia is appealing: Research has shown that nostalgia can combat loneliness, because it reminds us that we have social support and counteract feelings of boredom.
For regular people, the GameStop hype looked like an opportunity to break past barriers that exist in the way of making money. Some people perceive it like winning the lottery, Newcomb says.
People who were able to get in on the Gamestop squeeze early and get out in time to make money have been posting stories on social media about what they're doing with the windfall, from paying off debt from loans to planning for a wedding.
""Money represents your opportunities and options in life,"" Newcomb says. ""When faced with a narrative that says, 'you could have all your dreams come true overnight,' a lot of people are going to jump at that.""
""The world feels very small at this moment, because we're all really only connected to the world through our small little bubbles"" of information and people, says Newcomb.
""If everybody was out doing their own thing, and we weren't in our Covid bubbles, I don't know that this would have become as much of a market event,"" Newcomb says.
""People are looking for new things to do"" beyond ""doom scrolling"" negative news about the pandemic, the election and the Capitol insurrection, Newcomb says. ""Catching onto anything new that has an element of excitement to it may be contributing [to the frenzy] as well.""
