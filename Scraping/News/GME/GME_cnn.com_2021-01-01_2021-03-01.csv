            At the core of Donald Trump’s angry populist appeal was – and is – this sentiment: The elites think they know better than you. They think they can tell you how to live and what to believe. But guess what? We the people are smarter than the elites!


            Trump elucidated this argument in its purest form at a rally in North Dakota in 2018 when he went on this riff:
    

“I meet these people they call them ‘the elite.’ These people. I look at them, I say, ‘That’s elite?’ We got more money, we got more brains, we got better houses, apartments, we got nicer boats, we’re smarter than they are, and they say they’re elite? We’re the elite. You’re the elite. We’re the elite.”


“So I said the other day, let’s keep calling these people—and let’s face it, they’ve been stone-cold losers, the elite, the elite—so let them keep calling themselves the elite. But we’re going to call ourselves—and remember you are indeed, you work harder, but you are indeed smarter than them—let’s call ourselves from now on the super-elite. We’re the super-elite.”

            What made Trump’s argument so potent, politically speaking, is that he wasn’t just calling out the elites. He was saying that Average Joes needed to rise up and actually show them how wrong they were – that voting him for him was the best way to express their anger and frustration with the condescension of their alleged bettors. Donald Trump offered himself up as a collective middle finger to the elites. And he won.
    

            All of which brings me to the current – seemingly inexplicable – stock surge of GameStop, the video-game seller that has made its money over the years thanks to its locations in malls.
    

            The origins of the surge are in the prevalent belief among Wall Street sharps – professional investors – that GameStop’s stock, even before this recent spike, was overvalued. After all, shopping malls are in a long decline – “Malls are doomed: 25% will be gone in 5 years,” read a CNN headline in 2017 – that has only been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. 
    

            As a result of the belief among the pro investor crowd that GameStop was, essentially, doomed, they began shorting the stock – essentially betting on it to fail. This happens all the time to a variety of stocks with very little fanfare. It is the way of the modern stock market.
    

            Except that this time, amateur investors decided to revolt against the pros. Using Reddit – and a subreddit known as r/wallstreetbets – the amateurs began a coordinated effort of buying GameStop stock to drive its price higher and higher. (It’s worth noting that Reddit was also a gathering spot for some of the most ardent Trump supporters in 2016.)
    

            That effort to screw the pros – people with a short position on a stock that is surging have major vulnerabilities the higher the stock goes – got an unexpected boost from none other than iconoclast-in-chief and Tesla founder Elon Musk, who tweeted “Gamestonk!” with a link to the “wallstreetbets” subreddit on Tuesday.
    

            (Musk has also been a longtime critic of social media censoring and was a prominent Covid-19 skeptic. Sound like anyone else we know?)
    

            And there’s no question that the populist revolt has worked for GameStop stock. On December 28, it was trading at $20.99 a share. On Wednesday, it was a shade under $335 a share.

            What’s the end game for the GameStop surgers? Like, now that they have proven the point that they can take a stock that the pros have declared moribund and revive it – at least for a moment – what do they do now? Because they don’t really believe that GameStop is suddenly the new Amazon or Apple or Google. It’s still mostly a business that derives its value from brick and mortar stores in malls. Which, again, is not exactly a big growth area in the coming years.
    

            The point is that there is no real point beyond showing up the pros – proving to them that they aren’t as smart as they think they are and that they don’t have the ability to control everything.
    

            Which, again, has its roots in Trumpism. The entire notion of Trump’s candidacy and presidency was to stick it to the elites. And then, well, uh, there wasn’t really a plan beyond that. The screwjob was the point. (Montreal screwjob reference!)
    

            That strategy – if that is even a word that can be associated with what this is – has massive limits. Sticking it to the man will only get you so far. It’s not a solution to any problem. It’s just a way to express frustration, anger and a feeling of helplessness.
    

            Think of it this way: Giving someone the finger might make you feel good in the moment. But it doesn’t solve anything.

            Hot Stocks 




            GameStop is expected to lose money this year and next year. Sales growth is sluggish as fewer gamers need to go to stores — or even shop online — when they can download new titles directly from their consoles, PCs, phones or tablets.  So why are shares of the video game retailer up more than 275% so far in 2021?
    

            The company can thank a loyal group of investors on Reddit who continue to back the stock even as many others on Wall Street have argued that the shares are overvalued and due for a sharp decline. 
    

            The stock was extremely volatile on Monday, and it was halted several times. Shares more than doubled at one point, and finished the day 18% higher.
    

            Posters on the WallStreetBets subreddit have been touting the company aggressively. That appears to have helped fuel a so-called short squeeze in GameStop
            
                (GME) stock. 
    

            A large number of investors have bet against GameStop recently by borrowing shares and selling them with the hopes that they can then repurchase the stock at a lower price and pocket the difference.
    

            That’s a risky strategy: If a stock suddenly spikes higher, short sellers may have to rush en masse to buy back shares or risk losing their shirts. The more that a shorted stock goes up, the bigger the losses become if a short seller doesn’t buy back (or cover) their position. That creates the squeeze.

Why stocks that investors love to bet against often go up -- a lot 


Citron Research, an investing firm that often identifies stocks it thinks are overvalued and therefore could be good short-selling candidates, has learned the hard way what can happen when investors squeeze a stock higher. 
    

            Citron founder Andrew Left called GameStop a “failing mall-based retailer” in a report earlier this month and then predicted that the stock would plunge to $20 in a video he posted to Twitter on Thursday. At the time, GameStop was trading around $40. The stock surged to $65 by Friday and is now trading around $100. 
    

            Left has now given up on shorting GameStop, citing harassment by the stock’s backers.
    

            He also tweeted last week that “too many people” were hacking Citron’s Twitter feed, causing him to delay the posting of his video, which was originally planned for Wednesday. Left was not immediately available for further comment.
    

            The victory for GameStop’s vocal bulls on Reddit shows how dangerous it is for investors to bet against stocks that have a significant cult following. BlackBerry
            
                (BB), another favorite among Reddit’s WSB followers, has also surged this year.  
    

            Some gleeful GameStop investors are even looking to cash in by selling merchandise touting the stock rally. 
    

            JonesTrading chief market strategist Mike O’Rourke noted in a report Monday that there is now a commemorative patch listed on Etsy that celebrates the GameStop stock spike. More than 100 have been sold so far.

Is the stock market in a bubble? The debate is heating up


            To be sure, GameStop does have some upside beyond the Reddit love.
    

            Despite its name, the retailer doesn’t sell only games. GameStop is also popular with fans of pop culture collectibles, such as Star Wars toys and Funko
            
                (FNKO) figurines, which help attract shoppers who aren’t hardcore gamers to visit the brick and mortar shops. 
    

            GameStop announced earlier this month that same-store sales rose nearly 5% during the 2020 holiday season and that digital sales skyrocketed more than 300%. 
    

            Overall sales were still down though, due primarily to temporary store closures as a result of a spike in Covid-19 cases in December as well as supply disruptions due to strong demand for new PS5 and Xbox Series X.consoles from Sony
            
                (SNE) and Microsoft
            
                (MSFT).
    

            GameStop had no comment for this story, but the firm is making some changes as it attempts to become a more digitally-focused retailer.
    

            The company announced earlier this month that Ryan Cohen, founder of online pet supply store Chewy, is now on GameStop’s board along with two other former Chewy executives. Cohen’s RC Ventures is one of the largest investors in GameStop. 
    

            “The three new directors collectively bring deep expertise in e-commerce, online marketing, finance and strategic planning to GameStop,” the company said in a press release about the board moves.

            Still, some investing experts are worried that the rise in GameStop has gone too far too fast and could be yet another sign of speculative mania in what has suddenly become a frothy overall market.
    

            “Generally speaking, stocks with high short interest have been some of the top performers this year,” said analysts at Bespoke Investment Group in a report earlier this month. 
    

            The Bespoke report also noted that struggling retailer Bed Bath & Beyond
            
                (BBBY), mall owner Macerich
            
                (MAC) and hard hit movie theater operator AMC
            
                (AMC) are other examples of heavily shorted stocks that are up substantially in 2021.

            Melvin Capital, a premier Wall Street hedge fund entangled in the frenzy over GameStop
            
                (GME), lost 53% in January, a source familiar with the matter told CNN Business. 
    

            Melvin, a major short-seller of GameStop, bet that the company’s shares would drop. But, on January 11, GameStop announced new board members who could help it with digital sales. That set off a fury on Reddit, namely subreddit WallStreetBets, which catapulted GameStop’s stock more than 1,600%.
    

            Hedge funds like Melvin with huge short positions in GameStop and other stocks targeted by WallStreetBets got burned. The Reddit group specifically targeted stocks that were heavily shorted. At one point, GameStop had more short interest than shares on the market.
    

            The Wall Street Journal first reported Melvin’s losses.
    

            Melvin Capital was founded by Gabe Plotkin, and it started the year with roughly $12.5 billion in assets. It ended the month with more than $8 billion after receiving commitments from current investors for more capital in the final days of the month, the source said. 
    

            Last week, Citadel, a hedge fund owned by billionaire Ken Griffin, provided the firm with a more-than-$2-billion bailout.
    

            “The fund’s portfolio liquidity is strong,” the source said. “Use of leverage is at the lowest level since Melvin Capital’s inception in 2014.”
    

            Melvin found itself at the heart of the GameStop saga after Robinhood suspended trading of the stock and several others Thursday. The move was followed by an onslaught of backlash from individual investors, such as those from Reddit, who felt Robinhood was giving into pressures from Wall Street and the requests of hedge fund managers.
    

            The frustration from Robinhood users was soon followed by a class-action lawsuit against the stock-trading app for its decision of restricting trading of stocks like GameStop.

"A college student made big bucks off GameStop stock. Now he's donating video games to a children's hospital","https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/us/college-student-gamestop-stock-donates-to-hospital-trnd/index.html","Tue, 02 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT","CNN","
            After making thousands off GameStop stock last week, a 20-year-old college student used his newfound riches to pay it forward to a local children’s hospital. 
    

            Hunter Kahn, a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University, donated multiple Nintendo Switch consoles and games to Children’s Minnesota Hospital in Minneapolis after cashing out almost $30,000 in GameStop stock last Wednesday, he told CNN.
    
A post shared by Hunter Kahn (@hkahn3)

            GameStop shares have jumped 1,625% in the past month. The soaring percentages are mostly due to a group of investors on Reddit, who are buying the stock in a movement to hurt short sellers and hedge funds that bet on the stock to go down. 
    

            Kahn, who lives in Stillwater, Minnesota, said he participated in purchasing GameStop stock to join the movement to prove “the big boys on Wall Street” wrong. But, he said, donating a portion of his new fortune toward helping kids at the hospital felt better than waking up to any monetary gain. 
    

            “As a beneficiary of the recent events on Wall Street I think it is important that myself and others pay forward our good fortune,” Kahn wrote in an Instagram post. “These events have highlighted a lot of corruption and with this transfer of power it is important that we don’t become men in suits ourselves.”
    

            Kahn’s donations are valued at more than $2,000, Children’s Minnesota Hospital said. 
    

            “We’re so grateful for this generous donation that will help bring joy to kids at our hospitals, especially during these challenging times,” Jennifer Soderholm, president of Children’s Minnesota Foundation, said in an email statement to CNN. “It’s inspiring to see young people in our community choosing to give back and pay it forward.” 
    

            His donations include: six Nintendo Switch Lites, multiple games and e-shop gift cards, and screen protectors and cases.
    

            The hospital said patients are already using the donations.
    

            “There’s no group of people more deserving of receiving a bunch of video games than some kids going through a hard time,” Kahn told CNN. 
    

            After Kahn shared a photo of his donation on the Reddit page WallStreetBets, many in the online day trading community praised him. He garnered more than 179,000 upvotes on his post. One user lauded his actions, calling him “The real Robinhood.”
    

            Kahn said he encourages others who have profited from the movement to continue to use their good fortunes to pay it forward. 
    

            “If we’re criticizing these people on Wall Street and moving the money from one side to the other side, it would be meaningless if we behave exactly like these people that we were criticizing,” he said. 
    

            He is still holding on to the original 50 shares that he bought at $30, and said he plans to use the rest of his earnings toward paying off his college tuition.
    

  Correction: An earlier version of this story listed the wrong type of Nintendo consoles donated to the children's hospital. Hunter Kahn donated six Nintendo Switch Lites.

"The man behind Fortnite is making the riskiest bet of his career. The payoff could be huge","https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/10/tech/tim-sweeney-epic-games-risk-takers/index.html","Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT","CNN","
            Over the course of his career Tim Sweeney has been unafraid to take on tech industry giants.
    

            The CEO and founder of Epic Games has had a knack for picking the right battles while also shoring up his company’s independence. Fortnite, the company’s blockbuster battle royale game, recently topped more than 15 million concurrent players and has spawned a universe of fandom. Epic challengedestablished platforms by launching its own digital video game storefront. And the multi-billion dollar company developed the Unreal Engine, a proprietary software for making its own video games that it licenses out to other developers and animators.
    

            Now Sweeney, 50, is embarking on the biggest battle in his company’s 30-year history: Epic is suing Apple and Google in a legal challenge that could remake the future of the digital economy.
    

            “Epic’s frustration with Apple especially, and Google to some extent, had been building up for at least three years. Ever since Fortnite grew to have a large audience, we felt stifled by several things,” Sweeney told CNN Business during a December interview.
    

            Launched in 2017, Fortnite quickly became a phenomenon. When it first debuted, Epic charged$40 to download the game — a typical price. But the company quickly pivoted toa riskier business model, betting that offering Fortnite as a free-to-play game with in-app purchases of digital items like outfits would generate more overall revenue.
    

            The bet paid off. Though Epic has raked in billions off Fortnite’s in-game purchases — about $1.3 billion in 2020 and $1.8 billion in 2019, according to Nielsen’s gaming division SuperData — the company balked at paying a chunk of that revenue to app store owners like Apple and Google. If a player downloaded Fortnite from Apple’s App Store, for example, Apple would receive a 30% cut of all in-app purchases. 
    

            Sweeney believed that requirement violated antitrust laws because it forced developers to use Apple and Google’s payment systems. 
    

            So Epic spent months developing its battle plan to fight Apple, which it codenamed “Project Liberty,” he said.
    

            The company prepped a 60-page lawsuit and created a video that parodied Apple’s classic “1984” commercial, for good measure. 
    

            On August 13, Project Liberty was sprung into action — a plan that sought to force the tech giants into response.
    

            In a blog post, Epic encouraged Fortnite users to pay the company directly for in-app purchases. Both Google and Apple promptly removed Fortnite from their stores, alleging the company violated their terms of service. Epic then filed lawsuits against each of the companies, in which Epic argued the courts should intervene and order Apple and Google to allow developers to sell in-app purchases without the 30% revenue cut.
    

            “Epic’s problem is entirely self-inflicted and is in their power to resolve,” Apple said in a statement. “Epic has been one of the most successful developers on the App Store, growing into a multibillion dollar business that reaches millions of iOS customers around the world. We very much want to keep the company as part of the Apple Developer Program and their apps on the Store.” 
    

            Google responded that it had “consistent policies that are fair to developers” and that Fortnite had violated those rules. “However, we welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring Fortnite back to Google Play,” it added.
    

            For Sweeney, who spoke to CNN Business via video call from his home, the battle against Apple and Google is about more than just a 30% cut of its revenue. 
    

            “I grew up in a time in which anybody could make software. This is my first computer, an Apple II,” said Sweeney, gesturing towards the iconic blocky, grey machine on the desk behind him. “You turn it on and it comes up with a programming language prompt,” he continued. “So I felt all along that open platforms are the key to free markets and the future of computing.”
    

            In 1991, a young, 20-something Sweeney founded Epic, then known as Potomac Computer Systems, as a way to sell copies of a video game he made himself. He ran the company out of his parents’ house in Maryland.
    

            While Epic produced its own shooter games like Fire Fight and Unreal, it also began licensing its game development technology to other game makers in the late 1990s. This became the Unreal Engine, a ubiquitous game software which is now an essential part of Epic’s business. Between 2012 and 2017, Epic survived mostly on revenue generated from the Unreal Engine’s licensing fees, said Sweeney. Today, the Unreal Engine is also usedin animation, such as creating scenes for Disney’s “The Mandalorian.”
    

            Sweeney said he always envisioned Epic as a multi-faceted business. He wanted Epic to bothmakeand sell games — and create and license the tools used to make them.
    

            One part of that equation was, of course, Fortnite.
    

            From the outset, Epic has always has always had outsized ambitions for Fortnite. The game has dozens of crossovers each year, fromMarvel’s Avengers to Star Wars. Ithostsmassive virtual concerts and gives gamers endless shiny features, with the aim that there’s something new each time a player logs on. But the breakneck speed of development allegedlyhad a real cost for its workers, some of whom told gaming publication Polygon in 2019 that they regularly worked 70-hour weeks. Since then, Epic has made changes including hiring more people, soliciting more employee feedback, offering unlimited paid time off and mandating company-wide vacations, according to the company.
    

            Epic’s decision in 2018 to expand into selling third-party games created yet another business opportunity, and yet another fight against the establishment. Bylaunching its own games store, and cutting out the middleman, Epic was attempting to break into an already thriving market for PC games that was, at the time, dominated by Steam, a popular games store. 
    

            “We had to move mountains in order to have any chance of gaining traction at all,” said Sweeney. Epic’sstore attracted attention for splashy stunts like giving away Grand Theft Auto V, which is the best-selling game in the US in the last decade, according to NPD Group.
    

            While the Epic Games Store has gained momentum, attracting over 160 million PC users and generatingover $700 million in purchases last year according to the company, critics object to its exclusive deals that keep certain games out of other stores. Sweeney has defended his position, saying the store exclusives are a reasonable strategy that helps Epic compete against Steam. 
    

            In 2019, Epic acquired social media app Houseparty and later announced it would add voice chat to Fortnite through the app. 
    

            The company was valued at $17.3 billion as of 2020, making Sweeney a billionaire.
    

            While investors of Epic include Tencent, which has a 39% stake, and Sony, which purchased a 1.4% stake in 2020 for $250 million, Sweeney remains the CEO and controlling shareholder. 
    

            Competitor Roblox has announced its plans for a direct listingand Unity — a rival to Unreal — went public in 2020. But Epic Games has little interest in an IPO.
    

            “We’re still a highly independent company who’s not beholden to public markets in which we have to show ever-increasing profits,” said Sweeney. “And anything like a fight like this [with Apple and Google], which loses us money for a year or more, would never be tolerated. So we have the financial independence to do that.”
    

            Epic’s business model gives it a flexibility that other tech companies don’t necessarily have.
    

            “Unlike Facebook, iOS doesn’t drive the majority of Epic’s revenues. Unlike Spotify or Netflix, Epic is highly profitable,” said Matthew Ball, a former Amazon Studios executive and strategist who has penned over 20,000 words on Fortnite and Epic. “And unlike almost all other large companies, Epic is private and majority controlled by one person.”
    

            Ball added that the fight with Apple and Google didn’t come without sacrifices for Epic, which might see avid iPhone users find other games to replace Fortnite as the app spends months if not years in legal purgatory. “But Epic is uniquely able to push back,” he said.
    

            Sweeney declined to say how much the company is spending on legal fees, but he said that the fight to take on Apple and Google is costing “lots and lots” of senior leadership time. 
    

            And the ban on Fortnite in app stores is costing the company plenty in lost revenue. Fortnite users have spent about $1.2 billion globally on the game on iOS since its launch, according to mobile app tracker Sensor Tower.
    

            Epic’s case against Apple is expected to go to trial in May. Google is seeking to have Epic’s suit dismissed in a hearing scheduled on February 18.
    

            Such a public fray has unnerved some developers, who fear that Apple might go a step further and remove apps from its store simply for being built using the Unreal Engine, which it briefly threatened to do last August.
    

            “We were legitimately planning to switch to Unreal for our next VR project but after Tim decided to poke the bear we decided it wasn’t [worth] the risk,” game developer Ryan Engle tweeted in December. “I love Epic and Unreal, but business is business and the real-world consequences of Apple banning Epic is too much risk for us.”
    

            Sweeney responded saying that Engle’s “fear of retaliation by Apple” was shared by many developers, but Epic would “fight on just the same!”
    

            Epic is also risking Fortnite’s market share on iOS and Android platforms, as fans may turn to other games during the legal battle. On Android devices, Fortnite can be downloaded from Epic’s website and app stores other than Google’s Play Store, so while access is hindered, it’s not eliminated. However on Apple devices, the game can no longer be downloaded at all.
    

            Sweeney also faced backlash in November for controversially comparingFortnite’s legal battle to the civil rights movement.
    

            “The point is if you really want to make a difference, you have to buck the system,” Sweeney said in response to the criticism. “I think there’s a lot we can learn from any of the past struggles in humanity and I think it’s perfectly healthy to apply struggles from vital causes in the history of the world to struggles over smaller issues like software platforms.”
    

            For Epic Games and Sweeney, the risks are worthwhile. Sweeney fearsa dystopianfuture where tech platforms are dominated by a few companies and the most successful apps are cloned by those companies to maximize profits. 
    

            “[The companies] will just do that industry by industry and app category by app category until they’ve gobbled up everything that matters. And who will be left?” said Sweeney. “A million indie developers who collectively together make a small percentage of revenues on the app store because these businesses are too small to be attractive to steal.”
    

            In what Epic’s best case scenario, the court could rule that Apple and Google are prohibited from bundling payment services with their app stores, allowing developers to be paid directly, according to legal experts. 
    

            Butif Epic loses, it will at least make clear what the limits of antitrust law are, so people with similar grievances can look to appeal Congress for antitrust reform, according to John Bergmayer, legal director of consumer rights group Public Knowledge.
    

            “I think [Epic winning the lawsuits] would be pretty good for the markets overall,” said Mitch Stoltz, senior staff attorney of the nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an August interview. “You’d see more experimentation. You’d see more business models. You’d see more innovation.”
    

            As for Sweeney, he’s optimistic Epic can change the industry.
    

            “It’s Epic fighting or pressing for change and succeeding, and it’s not that unusual,” he said. “We’ve done it many times and everybody in the industry has benefited often.”

            Hot Stocks 




            There was a lot to unpack in the deluge of news this week about GameStop, the stock market, Reddit groups, trading apps and hedge funds. If it all seemed like too much, we can’t blame you for tuning out.
    

            While we don’t know just how the so-called Reddit rebellion will change the future of investing, it’s safe to say Wall Street will never be the same. 
    

            Here are five key things you need to know about Wall Street’s wild week. 
    

            At the heart of the GameStop saga is a struggle between two drastically different groups of investors: A band of amateur day traders versus a bunch of Wall Street pros known as short-sellers.

Inside the Reddit army that's crushing Wall Street


            The Davids, in this case, are the mostly young day traders who congregate on the Reddit page WallStreetBets — aka the Reddit army, or the Reddit mob, depending on your point of view. “They have seen the rich get extremely rich by taking advantage of cheap money, and they want to get their piece as well,” said Richard Fisher, the former president of the Dallas Federal Reserve. 
    

            Their mission has two main goals: Drive up stock prices to score profits for themselves, and at the same time, force the establishment investors to abandon bearish bets against struggling companies such as GameStop
            
                (GME), AMC
            
                (AMC), Macy’s
            
                (M) and several others.
    

            The Goliaths are mostly hedge funds who are shorting those stocks — in other words, big-shot investors placing bets that those shares will crash. They are also the Wall Street elite upon whom millions of investors rely to make smart decisions to boost their portfolios. But working in an industry associated with the house-of-cards system that created the 2008 financial crisis, these giants are not exactly beloved. Posts on the WallStreetBets subreddit openly relish watching short-sellers lose billions of dollars. 
    

            The WallStreetBets community, which now boasts some 5 million followers, has been around since 2012. Describing itself as if “4chan found a Bloomberg terminal,” the forum’s giddy nihilism, inscrutable language and acerbic memes have fueled a war on a perceived corrupted mainstream.
    

            The group noticed that GameStop, the struggling brick-and-mortar video game retailer, was heavily shorted by hedge funds. (The consensus on Wall Street seemed to be that GameStop would soon go the way of Blockbuster.)
    

            Reddit investors took a different view from the short-sellers, however, and began buying up shares of the company that they believed were undervalued. 
    

            Although it had been building for a while, the rally really took off on Monday, January 11, when GameStop announced three new directors would join its board, including Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen. Investors liked that Cohen brought digital experience to the table, something GameStop desperately needs, as video games go digital and malls continue their unrelenting slump into irrelevance.
    

            GameStop’s stock rose a little less than 13% that day. But this wasn’t a normal, momentary stock surge. Two days later, it rose 57%. Then 27%…and so on. The Reddit crowd also drove huge jumps in AMC, BlackBerry, Macy’s and other stocks that were heavily shorted.
    

            As of Friday, GameStop’s stock was up a jaw-dropping 1,587% since the beginning of January. 
    

            For perspective: One year ago, a single share cost about $4. It’s now about $150.

Analysis: Hedge funds bitching about Reddit can cry me a river  


            The surge ultimately had little or nothing to do with GameStop’s strength as a business. As investors following the Reddit group bought a ton of GameStop options, short-sellers were forced to buy shares to cover their losing bids — thus boosting the share price even further. This is what’s known as a short squeeze. 
    

            Millions of people, including Elon Musk, chimed in. 
    

            It quickly became “a populist uprising armed with no-fee brokerage accounts instead of pitchforks,” as CNN’s Christine Romans put it. And the only ones crying foul were the “sophisticated” Wall Street players.
    

            “The irony is delicious,” Romans writes. “An online flash mob beats Wall Street insiders at their own game.”
    

            On Tuesday, GameStop was the most traded stock on the planet. Then Robinhood crashed the party. 
    

            Thursday morning, citing extreme volatility, the free trading app favored by millions of amateur investors suspended trading of the red-hot Reddit darlings. That left the WSB crowd with just two options: hold or sell. Meanwhile institutional investors, who don’t need Robinhood to execute trades, were able to carry on. 
    

            GameStop shares lost more than 44% of their value on Thursday after surging nearly 40% at one point earlier in the day. 
    

            The backlash was swift. Those who’d been minting money on their GameStop stock positions were, to put it mildly, furious. The consensus on social media seemed to be that Robinhood, which built its brand on “democratizing” investing, appeared to be caving to pressure from powerful institutions on Wall Street.

Class-action lawsuit filed against Robinhood following outrage over GameStop stock restriction


            Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called the decision “unacceptable.” One Reddit user swiftly filed a class-action lawsuit, claiming Robinhood rigged the market against its customers. 
    

            Robinhood relented Thursday night, saying it would resume “limited” buys on the stocks the next day. It also tapped $1 billion in cash from its private investors, signaling it was short on cash. 
    

            On Friday morning, the GameStop euphoria was back. The stock opened up roughly 100%. 
    

            There’s an argument to be made that GameStop was undervalued, but hardly anyone believes that GameStop, BlackBerry, Macy’s, AMC or any of the other companies that the Reddit crowd is promoting have the fundamentals to support such sky-high prices. At some point, reality will set in.
    

            But that’s the problem with bubbles — get out too early, and you lose at a chance to cash out on top. So GameStop keeps surging … until it doesn’t.
    

            “Someone is going to get hurt,” said Fisher, the former Dallas Fed president. “As happens with crowd behavior, you end up having people come in at the end at a very high price and getting burned.”
    

            The Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency that regulates Wall Street, said it will “closely review” actions by trading platforms to restrict transactions.

            Hot Stocks 




            If you thought the GameStop drama was over, think again. 
    

            ICYMI: Last week, a tense showdown played out on Wall Street. It was a David vs. Goliath tale in which a band of amateur investors on Reddit took on Wall Street pros by inflating the share price of GameStop (and other securities).
    

            The mass buying spree led to huge gains for some in the Reddit crowd who got in early. Hedge funds, meanwhile, lost billions of dollars on their short positions. 
    

            While GameStop and other Reddit faves surged, the broader stock market had its worst week since October. And traders were bracing for more volatility on Monday. 
    

            Here’s what you need to know. 
    

            GameStop, the struggling mall-based retailer, was up 600% for the week as of Friday, so anyone thinking of getting in on the rally now would be (rightly) wary of buying high only to have the stock crash. That means they’re hunting for deals elsewhere. 
    

            Enter silver.  
    

            Last week, people on WallStreetBets, the Reddit community fueling the rally, set their sights on silver and the iShares Silver Trust ETF (that’s “exchange-traded fund” — a basket of securities that trade like a stock). Some promoted it as a way to hurt big banks they believe are artificially suppressing prices.
    

            On Monday, silver prices jumped 13% to an eight-year high. 
    

            “The #silversqueeze is a rage against the machine,” tweeted Tyler Winklevoss. (Yes, that Winklevoss.) 
    

            However, it’s not clear who the Reddit users are — nor whether their market moves match the claims online. In fact, some posts on WallStreetBets late Sunday and Monday suggested their movement is being co-opted by hedge funds and there is no coordinated effort in the silver market.
    

            “The Silver Squeeze is a hedge-fund coordinated attack so they can keep fighting the $GME fight,” one thread was titled. 
    

            No one knows. 
    

            Senator Elizabeth Warren, an outspoken defender of consumer rights and frequent critic of big banks and hedge funds, is calling for the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate. 
    

            “We actually don’t know who all the players are in all this — whether there’s big money on both sides,” Warren said on CNN on Sunday. “That’s why we need an SEC investigation.”
    

            She called Robinhood’s decision to flip the switch and prevent users from buying GameStop in the middle of a trading session “just wrong.”
    

            Last week, the trading app used by millions of everyday investors temporarily blocked trades on red-hot Reddit darlings like Gamestop and about a dozen others, prompting a massive backlash. 
    

            The reason, Robinhood said, was not because it was bowing to pressure from big Wall Street firms, as many on social media accused it of doing. 
    

            The surge in trading was simply so huge that Robinhood, a seven-year-old startup, was facing a cash crunch. 
    

            Why? When you buy a stock on Robinhood, you might think that it instantly becomes yours when you tap “buy.” But behind the scenes, there’s more going on. 
    

            All trades have to go through a clearinghouse — these are obscure intermediary institutions that mitigate risk between buyers and sellers. 
    

            As the Reddit frenzy grew, it triggered the the risk-reduction mechanisms managed by clearinghouses, meaning Robinhood had to find emergency cash to be able to continue executing trades. 
    

            Robinhood’s CEO Vlad Tenev said the $3 billion ask was “an order of magnitude” larger than what Robinhood is typically required by the National Securities Clearing Corporation to put up. It had to tap its existing investors for a $1 billion cash infusion. 
    

            On Monday, Robinhood raised yet another $2.4 billion from shareholders. The $3.4 billion total is more than the company has raised in its entire existence, according to the Wall Street Journal. 
    

            The app eased some restrictions on Friday, after taking a PR beating online. On Sunday it said it would further lift restrictions on stock trades — but not entirely. For instance, Robinhood users are able to buy only one share of GameStop and 10 shares of AMC.
    

            That’s Melvin Capital, a premier Wall Street hedge fund that just lost a lot of money. 
    

            Melvin was a major short-seller of GameStop, meaning it had a sizable bet that the shares would drop. So when GameStop’s stock shot up more than 1,600%, it got burned. 
    

            Melvin lost some 53% of investments in January, a person familiar with the matter told CNN Business.


            The loss is so staggering, and so potentially destabilizing, that other hedge funds, led by Citadel, provided Melvin with a more-than-$2-billion bailout.
    

  CNN Business’ Matt Egan and Jazmin Goodwin contributed reporting.

            Hot Stocks 




            US stocks started February on a better note, chipping away at some of the recent losses that turned the last week — as well as the last month — into the worst since October.
    

            After rallying all day, US indexes finished sharply higher. The Dow ended up 0.8%, or 229 points, while the broader S&P 500
            
                (SPX) closed 1.6% higher in its best day since November. The Nasdaq Composite
            
                (COMP) closed up 2.6%.
    

            GameStop
            
                (GME), meanwhile, took a beating, closing down more than 30%. The gaming retailer dominated Wall Street last week after a group of retail investors chatting on Reddit pushed the stock up some 400%, causing a massive short squeeze for institutional investors, such as hedge funds, who had been betting against the business.
    

            The GameStop frenzy raised many questions including whether investment products were priced appropriately and the democratization of trading.
    

            But at the start of this week, stock indexes around the globe are in the green.
    

            The Reddit investors have moved on to literally shinier things: silver. Silver futures, which had been up as much as 10% earlier, were still up more nearly 9% at more than $29 per ounce at the closing bell. Stock traders must be glad about this new focus.
    

            Various trading platforms and brokerages again experienced issues on Monday morning, according to Downdetector. Brokers struggled on multiple occasions last week and some slapped restrictions on trading stocks favored in the Reddit forums, including GameStop.
    

            In terms of bigger macro themes, the vaccine rollout that promises the end of lockdowns at some point in the future remains a focus. As does President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus package, which is a topic of debate in Washington.
    

            Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that it would take the economy until the middle of the year to recover to its pre-pandemic size.
    

            It’s also a week with plenty of economic data, including a look at the US jobs market in January. Following the December loss of 140,000 jobs the expectations for Friday’s report are muted, with a flat unemployment rate at 6.7% and a net gain of 50,000 jobs.
    

            In Monday’s economic data, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index showed that activity in the sector slowed slightly in January. The index fell to 58.7, down nearly 2 points versus December. Any value over 50 denotes an expansion in the sector.

            Latest Market News 




            Hot Stocks 




            No matter what happens next to shares of GameStop and AMC or the price of silver, average Joes and Janes are now an undeniable force to be reckoned with on Wall Street. 
    

            The short squeeze last week that propelled GameStop
            
                (GME) and other momentum investments popular with the Reddit crowd now appears to be on hold. GameStop
            
                (GME) plunged more than 50% Tuesday while AMC
            
                (AMC), silver prices and silver mining companies also fell sharply. 
    

            That’s partly due to trading restrictions from Robinhood and other brokers on how many shares of volatile stocks like GameStop, AMC
            
                (AMC), Express
            
                (EXPR) and Nokia
            
                (NOK) that retail investors can purchase in a single stock at a time.
    

            But heavily shorted stocks could wind up rallying again. In fact, on Tuesday Mark Cuban urged members of Reddit’s WallStreetBets community to stay the course with stocks like GameStop.
    

            “I have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on WSB,” the Dallas Mavericks owner and Shark Tank investor said on a Reddit AMA. “I know you are going to hate to hear this, but the lower it goes, the more powerful WSB can be stepping up to buy the stock again.”

Dow surges as stocks recover from GameStop mania


            After all, retail investors have proven that they can push hedge funds around – and they are likely to start focusing on other stocks and commodities that they think can (and should) move higher.
    

            “Social investing is not going away,” said Kerim Derhalli, CEO and founder of Invstr, a trading app. “This is a powerful commercial trend and we are just at the beginning of it. People have more information and power.”
    

            Derhalli pointed out that as younger investors increasingly start buying and selling stocks, the market will need to adapt. He said the rise of other popular stocks, such as Tesla
            
                (TSLA) and Beyond Mea
            
                (BYND)t are due partly to Millennials and Gen Zers investing in brands that they know and like. 
    

            “Younger retail investors are in touch with changes taking place. They understand consumer trends because they are the ones making and creating them,” Derhalli said. “There are some Millennials making a lot of money and there are hedge funds pissed off that retail investors have joined the game and are beating them at it.”
    

            Yet a number of Wall Street veterans are concerned that this won’t end well for smaller investors. 
    

            They point to the dot-com/tech stock collapse in 2000 as a sign of what can happen when retail investors get too excited and lose focus of fundamentals such as sales and earnings – not to mention valuations.

            “This is troubling and disconcerting. It could be like March 2000 all over again,” said Richard Smith, CEO of The Foundation for the Study of Cycles, a research firm.
    

            “What this has done more than anything is expose how gamified the stock market environment is, and it will hopefully have people ask questions about whether or not this is how we want markets to work,” Smith added.
    

            If average investors wind up getting burned by stocks like GameStop, that could lead to less confidence in Wall Street and the wider market. 
    

            Some lesser experienced investors may just give up on owning stocks altogether –  as many individuals did after the 2000 crash and again when Lehman Brothers imploded in 2008. 
    

            “The market is going to be destabilized. Too many people will lose money. Fewer people will participate in the stock market – not more,” said Sergey Savastiouk, founder and CEO of Tickeron, an artificial intelligence platform for traders and investors.
    

            “What’s going on with GameStop and AMC is like driving without a license,” he added.
    

            But there are some major differences between now and two decades ago – not to mention the Great Financial Crisis of 2008-2009, a time when social media and free online trading weren’t as ubiquitous as they are now. 
    

            Average investors can now trade more efficiently and in a cost-effective manner thanks to no-fee brokerage firms such as Robinhood – a move that essentially forced all the other major brokerages to drop commissions. 
    

            The rise of fractional trading (i.e. owning a set dollar amount of a high-priced stock like Amazon or Alphabet) and the popularity of index ETFs also makes it easier for investors to buy small pieces of many stocks.
    

            And Reddit’s megaphone is significantly louder and more influential than the old chat boards of the late 1990s.
    

            “This trend will not end anytime soon. There are some investors who play in the individual stock arena just the one time. But there is a fear of missing out,” said Gust Kepler, founder and CEO of BlackBoxStocks, a trading software firm.
    

            “That may not sound much different from the late 1990s with day traders, but now social media augments the ability for groups of investors to band together and share information in real time,” Kepler added.

            Along those lines, even Smith of the Foundation of Cycles expressed begrudging admiration for the Reddit traders who figured out how to stick it to the short sellers. 
    

            “I have respect for those who saw what was going on, how it worked and exploited it,” he said. “But what value has been created?”
    

            Stocks like GameStop and AMC aren’t increasing in value because they’re producing high revenue and profit, paying big dividends or adding significant juice to the economy by creating thousands of jobs.
    

            But that misses the point. There is no rule that says investors should only buy large blue chip companies. Some investors are growing tired of buying safer, passively run index funds and want to gamble.
    

            “Individual investors are often thought to be risk averse. But not all of them are,” said Josh White, a finance professor at Vanderbilt University and former SEC economist. “Some have a preference for what’s more like a lottery.” 
    

            “They may actually lose often but every now and then they will hit a home run like GameStop,” White said. “As long as there is that one big hit that takes place, people will keep gambling.”

            Hot Stocks 




            Hedge funds that bet against GameStop and other stocks have been crushed by the Reddit army – and they’re infecting the rest of Wall Street.
    

            The most heavily shorted stocks have nearly doubled in value over the last three months, according to Goldman Sachs. Those staggering gains created distress for short-sellers, setting off a negative spiral in the broader markets.
    

            “The past 25 years have witnessed a number of sharp short squeezes in the US equity market,” Goldman Sachs strategists wrote in a note published Monday, “but none as extreme as has occurred recently.”
    

            For context, the most heavily shorted stocks with market values above $1 billion rose by a more modest 77% during the second quarter of last year. The current short squeeze also exceeds the 56% rally for those stocks toward the end of the Great Recession and similar ones during the dotcom bubble.

            A mob of traders on Reddit’s WallStreetBets page have sent GameStop
            
                (GME), AMC
            
                (AMC) and other stocks skyrocketing in recent days. GameStop
            
                (GME) lost a quarter of its value Monday but it’s still up nearly 1,200% on the year. 
    

            WallStreetBets successfully triggered an epic short squeeze, where investors that bet against GameStop have been forced to unwind their bets and buy the stock back. That in turn has driven GameStop even higher, creating even more losses for short-sellers. 
    

            Melvin Capital, a hedge fund that bet heavily against GameStop, lost a stunning 53% of its value in January. The hedge fund eventually had to get bailed out by Citadel and Point72, two hedge funds that provided a $2.75 billion lifeline.


            The enormous losses for hedge funds and other short-sellers spilled over into the broader markets last week. The S&P 500 suffered its worst week since October – and some analysts at least partially blamed the Reddit-fueled mayhem. 
    

            Here’s why: Hedge funds that bet against GameStop and other Reddit-favored stocks were forced to take steps to counter their losses. Some faced margin calls, requests to put up more capital when positions weaken. To raise cash, they had to sell completely unrelated but highly liquid stocks such as Apple
            
                (AAPL) and Amazon
            
                (AMZN). And that in turn caused other investors to take chips off the table, continuing the negative feedback loop. 
    

            “This week demonstrated that unsustainable excess in one small part of the market has the potential to tip a row of dominoes and created broader market turmoil,” Goldman Sachs strategists wrote in the note.
    

            Not surprisingly, US stocks bounced back Monday as GameStop tumbled. The S&P 500 rallied 1.6%, its best one-day gain since November. The same pattern was playing out during premarket trading Tuesday.

            Goldman’s prime services arm, which caters to hedge funds, said that last week represented the largest active hedge fund de-grossing since February 2009 during the Great Recession. De-grossing means hedge funds unwound their positions – by closing out a bet against GameStop or by selling shares of a company like Alphabet, for example.
    

            Despite those moves, Goldman Sachs said that hedge fund net and gross exposures remain close to record highs, “indicating ongoing risk of positioning-driven selloffs.”
    

            Charlie McElligott, managing director at Nomura Securities, called last week a “crowding gross down shock” and warned that based on volatility metrics, more selling could be ahead.
    

            However, Goldman Sachs strategists remain bullish on the stock market, reiterating its prediction that the S&P 500 will end the year at 4,300. That would translate to an 14% gain from Monday’s close.
    

            The performance of the stock market after short squeezes tends to be dictated by the economy. When the pace of growth was improving, the S&P 500 tended to perform well during the month after short squeezes, according to Goldman Sachs.

            “If growth remains the key driver of stock prices, investors have reason for optimism,” Goldman Sachs strategists wrote.
    

            Others are concerned about how GameStop mania is another example of speculative excess in overly exuberant financial markets. From the red-hot IPO market to SPAC mania, evidence of bubble-like behavior is mounting.
    

            Citigroup’s Panic/Euphoria Model of market sentiment has been signaling caution since November. However, more recently this closely watched gauge has climbed above even the levels of early 2000 during the dotcom bubble, a “particularly troubling” development, Citigroup chief US equity strategist Tobias Levkovich warned clients in a note Monday.
    

            “We believe that too many investors are complacent and worry more about market rallies than pullbacks,” Levkovich wrote.
