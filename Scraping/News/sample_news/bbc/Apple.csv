Joe Biden's tech,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55821612,"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"President Biden
You might think the world's most powerful man would have access to any gadget he chooses - but when it comes consumer tech, Joe Biden may be sorely disappointed. 
The electronic devices around the US president are perhaps the most prominent hacking targets in the world. 
""The odds are zero, that [Russia] aren't targeting world leaders,"" Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Bruce Schneier says.
Back in the 2000s, this wasn't such a big problem - the only personal devices that could be hacked were computers and non-smart mobile phones. 
And why would the president need a mobile, when he could ask to be patched through to anyone in the world on a secure line.
But that all changed in 2009, when Barack Obama took office. 
He was so attached to his Blackberry he fought with security advisers for weeks to keep it - a fight he eventually won ""through a compromise that allows him to stay in touch with senior staff and a small group of personal friends"", according to an official.
And since then, the range of tech devices a president might want to use has steadily increased - giving security advisers sleepless nights. 
When the iPad came out, in 2010, of course, the president wanted one. 
So national-security advisers created the ObamaPad, a ""hardened"", more secure iPad, which, a former adviser tells BBC News, was replicated for his staff.
""In the Obama administration, for senior staff, it was common to have an iPad that had... certain modifications to it,"" says Ari Schwartz, a National Security Council cyber-security official during the Obama administration.
Barack Obama in 2014
Nevertheless, the tech set-up of the White House remained somewhat old fashioned.
""There's no wi-fi,"" Mr Schwartz says.
""And we actually had a little bit of a discussion at one point about adding wi-fi.
""It was more of a discussion like, 'Why can't we have wi-fi in the White House?'
""And the feeling was, 'Well, then you're opening up security lapses.'"" 
The Obamas' residence eventually installed wi-fi.
But it remained patchy at best, according to the family.
Donald Trump in 2020
Donald Trump, arguably the most famous man on Twitter during his term, also insisted on using a personal device, reportedly a series of ""burner"" phones used briefly and then replaced, external for security reasons.
But he was also widely reported to be sceptical of computer use, external and email, preferring paper for most communications.
If the iPad gave tech advisers a few sleepless nights back in the day, the internet of things, today, represents a recurring nightmare.
""Everything is becoming a computer,"" Mr Schneier says.
""And those computers are vulnerable. 
""Whether it's your Peloton bike or your phone, your refrigerator, your thermostat, toys, your car - these are all vulnerable to hacking."" 
And that is a problem for President Biden, who seems to like his gadgets. 
One of the watches Joe Biden wears is an Apple Watch
He has been photographed wearing an Apple Watch and reportedly owns a Peloton exercise bike that comes with a computer screen, camera, and microphone all connected to the internet. 
Can that be made secure? 
""You can do things like modify the hardware, like ripping the camera out, that's something that the NSA [National Security Agency] can do,"" Mr Schneier says.
And that may be safer.
But it may also defeat the purpose of having high-end technology in the first place.
Herbert Lin, of the University of Stanford, says: ""It's very rare that you find a device that can't be hacked.
""Most devices that can't be hacked are pretty useless because they can't communicate.""
The safest thing is simply to not use any tech gadgets at all. 
But, as the previous two presidents proved, that is a hard thing to tell the commander-in-chief.
According to Mr Biden's biographer Evan Osnos, external, the president also uses the Apple News app.
And this too could be a problem. 
In fact, Mr Schwartz says, software can be hardest to protect.
""The software side, it's a lot harder to maintain good security around, because everything is updated from afar now,"" he says.
""You might be totally secure right now, the day that you buy the product. 
""But then a year from now, someone could come in and install malware into it and destroy the security that you had originally.""
And Mr Schneier shares these concerns.
""Everything is a potential vulnerability… Apple News, everything, because it's all connected, because anything can affect any other thing,"" he says. 
""That's why this is so complicated. 
""That's why ditching the device is often the best security advice, even if it's not practical."" 
Late last year, news broke US government networks had been compromised by suspected Russian hackers.
The massive Solar Winds hack reportedly affected the treasury and commerce departments and Homeland Security.  
Even worse, once the hackers were in, they lay undetected for months. 
The hack showed two things: 
foreign actors are looking for cracks in US cyber-security
there are gaps to be found 
The nightmare scenario is a president's device is hacked, which then goes unnoticed. 
And that a hack has happened so recently - and so close to the White House - will have President Biden's security team worried. 
""Say the president's iPhone is hacked,"" Mr Lin says. 
""Now, you have a homing beacon that the president is carrying.""
Mr Biden is entering a White House nervous about cyber-security. 
And advisers know what is most secure and what the president wants are not usually aligned. 
President Biden may be the most powerful person in the most powerful country in the world. 
But he may also have a fight on his hands to keep the gadgets many others take for granted.

Hyundai's confusion over Apple electric car tie-up,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55583504,"Thu, 07 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Hyundai has sparked confusion over a possible electric car tie-up with Apple.
The South Korean car company initially said it was in the ""early stage"" of talks with the iPhone maker about a possible electric car partnership.
But hours later it backtracked and said it was talking with a number of potential partners without naming Apple.
Hyundai's share price rose more than 20% when the tie-up was announced.
""Apple and Hyundai are in discussions but they are at an early stage and nothing has been decided,"" it said in a statement which was later revised. Hyundai's value shot up $9bn (£6.5bn) after the Apple announcement.
While an updated statement said it was talking to a number of companies about a possible electric car tie-up including Apple, a later version omitted the US tech firm. 
Apple is known for its secretiveness when it comes to new products and partnerships. 
""I'm not surprised to see a big jump in the valuation of Hyundai. The stock market loves car companies who are tech firms as seen with Tesla rise,"" said Sarwant Singh, managing partner at consultants Frost & Sullivan. ""This partnership helps Hyundai be seen as a tech innovator.""
Last month, news emerged that Apple was moving forward with self-driving car technology with a 2024 launch date.
The electric vehicle (EV) market is becoming increasingly competitive, with companies such as Tesla grabbing the headlines with its rapidly-increasing valuation. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk is now the richest man in the world, displacing Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Experts say an electric vehicle from Apple is still at least five years away. 
They say pandemic-related delays could push the start of production into 2025 or beyond.
Hyundai has already been pushing into new technologies such as electric, driverless and flying cars.
Last month, it took a controlling stake in Boston Dynamics in a deal that valued the mobile robot firm at $1.1bn.
The company is also setting up a $4bn autonomous-driving joint venture with auto parts supplier Aptiv. 
Both partners will invest $2bn, while Ireland-based Aptiv will contribute about 700 engineers and transfer patents and intellectual property to the venture.
""Apple could certainly jumpstart that project and Hyundai brings the vehicle development and manufacturing expertise,"" said Jeff Schuster at automobile data firm LMC Automotive

Should I buy an electric car?
Apple's efforts to produce an electric car, known as Project Titan, have been on and off ever since plans were revealed in 2014. 
There have been rumours over who would assemble an Apple-branded car as it may be difficult for the tech giant to manufacture them on its own.
Its rival Alphabet's Waymo chose a factory in Detroit to mass produce its own self-driving cars.

""Because everything around me – the river, the cathedrals, the beautiful views – breathes history. Kolomna, Russia, has learned to live with its heritage; this gives us our love and our passion for what we do.” – Natalia Nikitina, entrepreneur
More Reasons to Love the World
Women in crinolines and bonnets, carrying trays loaded with treats and dainty teacups, weave their way between white cast-iron tables beneath the boughs of old fruit trees. People chat and enjoy the sunshine as it glints off the golden onion domes of the neighbouring church, while steam from a samovar swirls gently into the air. Along with these other visitors, I came here for a little taste of history.
The setting for this garden cafe is the medieval town of Kolomna, which lies 113km south-east of Moscow in a picturesque location at the confluence of three rivers. Kolomna has been renowned for its gardens and orchards since the 15th Century. In spring, a froth of apple and cherry blossom spills over into the streets from behind pastel-painted wooden palisades – a short-lived but spectacular display. Fruit has always been grown here, and it is no accident that the name of this town has become synonymous with an apple-based delicacy: pastila.
Pastila, pronounced with the stress on the final “a”, was first mentioned in the 16th-Century Russian Domostroi (Domestic Order), a codex of household rules and instructions on various religious, social and domestic matters. Originally developed as a means of preserving the apple harvest and providing a sweet treat throughout the winter months, it has nothing to do with the French pastille (another kind of sweet); instead, its name comes from the Russian verb postelit’ (to lay out).
Pastila is often equated with marshmallow, but this comparison does not do justice to its uniquely ethereal quality. It is made by baking apples until they are soft, then blending them into a purée before whipping them “into clouds” with egg whites and sugar. The mixture is spread out onto trays to a depth of about 2cm, then dried in a cool oven before being cut into strips or shapes. It’s an entirely natural product made exclusively from fresh ingredients; no starches, additives, colourings or preservatives are used, and it is low in calories. Pastila production requires firm, sour apple varieties – Russia’s famous Antonovka is the most suitable, being richer in pectin (a natural gelling agent) than other varieties.

It was in Kolomna, with its abundance of apple orchards, that the finest, fluffiest version is said to have been made. As an unknown source once proclaimed, “they have turned apples into clouds!”. From 1862, when the town became connected to Moscow via rail link, the reputation of Kolomna pastila spread across Russia and the product was sold in Moscow, St Petersburg and beyond. It continued to be manufactured in the town until 1914, when war and revolution put paid to the industry. From that year on, pastila became a forgotten taste and the town slipped into decline. Many of the town’s beautiful old buildings were left to decay, and Kolomna’s lack of inclusion in Russia’s Golden Ring tourist route meant no visitors came to spend their money there.
But recently, all of that has been changing thanks largely to the efforts of some inventive and resourceful women.

The story of the town’s revival goes back to 2008, when Kolomna hosted the European Speed Skating Championships. Tasked by the town council with creating a souvenir gift for visitors and competitors, council project manager Natalia Nikitina looked into the town’s history to come up with a gift specific to Kolomna.

For inspiration, she turned to the 18th-Century works of Ivan Lazhechnikov, the son of a rich Kolomna merchant. Reading his historical novel, The Ice Palace, Nikitina a was intrigued when she found a reference to a sweet treat called pastila. Together with her friend Elena Dimitrieva (who had a financial background in the construction industry) she started to research it.
The Russian State Library turned up several recipes from its archives, all of them involving oven-baked apples, beaten egg whites and honey or sugar. But they were too vague to be useful. One example came from the notebooks of Tolstoy’s wife Sofia, who wrote: “Put the apples in a cooling oven after baking bread” – but for how long, and at what temperature?
The women realised there was no option but to attempt their own experiments. Nikitina cheerfully describes their early efforts: “It kept splattering everywhere when we whipped it – it took us hours to clean it from the walls!” she said. But with patience and much experimentation, they finally came up with a satisfactory formula for baking, whipping and drying the mixture. 
Having successfully created their product, the women needed to find a suitable manufacturer to produce the pastila at scale. They approached seven confectionery firms within a radius of 100km, but none were able or willing to adapt their equipment. Undeterred, they simply set up their own factory in premises leased from the council, commissioning specially designed equipment based on archive sketches of old machinery.

Further research led to the discovery of some original packaging and labels, which the women used as templates for their own packaging. Armed with Dimitrieva’s business experience, they sourced their own paper and card, and set up a packaging production line.
As work progressed, their research at the State Library continued to uncover anecdotes and diary entries associating pastila with Catherine the Great, Pushkin, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, among other famous people and events. Dostoevsky, they learned, enjoyed the sweet treats with his cup of tea; his wife Anna wrote that he particularly loved his strips of red and white pastila (the red variety would likely have been flavoured with raspberry or redcurrant).
Nikitina also found references to different flavours and textures of pastila and set about both recreating them and developing new ones. They now produce dozens of varieties, including the fluffy “white-foam” type; dense strips of smokva (fruit leather); pretty layer cakes with pink icing; airy zefirs (similar to marshmallows); and pastila with additional natural flavours such as apricot, raspberry, cherry and plum. Perhaps the most desirable variety is muftovaya, named after the soft muffs worn by aristocratic women to keep their hands warm; it’s made by adding the egg whites to the apple puree while it is still hot, and beating for at least 10 hours, which makes it even airier than the usual varieties.
Kolomna has become synonymous with pastila, an apple-based sweet (Credit: Sheila Sim)
(And what did they do with all those egg yolks that weren’t required in the pastila? Ever resourceful, the women decided to use them by manufacturing traditional lapsha, or noodles).
Nikitina, whose creative vision drove the enterprise, sensed that people wanted not just to taste the product, but to understand its heritage. With a grant from the philanthropic Potanin Foundation and support from the town council, in 2009 the Museum of Forgotten Flavours was born – Russia’s first living museum, designed for people to taste pastila in the place it was originally made and enjoy learning about it from actors wearing 19th-Century costume. The charming garden café at the museum is where I experienced these treats. “This is a new kind of museum for Russia,” said Nikitina. “We’re preserving and presenting our intangible heritage, something ephemeral and elusive – tastes, smells, the culture of everyday living, a manner of talking.”
Nikitina knows she has revived something very special. “Pastila is natural and tasty, it looks beautiful, and it’s high quality,” she said. “Most importantly, this is not something that was ever made in Europe or anywhere else. It’s associated only with Russia, and we should be proud of this culinary and cultural heritage.”

Word quickly started to spread, and soon visitors were arriving from miles away to try a little taste of history. But pastila was just the start of Kolomna’s renaissance. Ever curious to learn more about the town’s heritage, Nikitina also found historical references to a traditional type of bread bun called a kalach, made from dough that is twisted or braided so that each bun has its own handle. Soon, this too was being put into production, and further grant funding enabled Nikitina to establish a separate bakery-museum nearby.
The literary connections with pastila inspired Nikitina and her team to instigate an arts residency and an annual book festival, and before long, the positive atmosphere in the town encouraged other small creative businesses to open.
A cluster of traditional industries is now developing (such as soap, silk and ceramics) in Kolomna’s posad (merchants’ quarter), just as there would have been centuries ago. Many employment opportunities have been created; Nikitina herself now employs around 100 people across a clutch of new museums, shops, cafes and production facilities. Many of Kolomna’s traditional wooden houses have been restored, showing off their decoratively carved nalichniki, or window frames. Kolomna is now firmly back on the map.
The coronavirus pandemic has brought its share of difficulties, of course, but Nikitina’s vision and passion remain undiminished. Continuing to reinvest all profits back into the business, she is now forging ahead with new plans. Part of her inspiration comes from the short story Antonov Apples by Nobel laureate Ivan Bunin, which he wrote in 1900 as a paean to the departed traditions of the Russian countryside. In the story, Bunin refers to several varieties of Russian apples which have now disappeared: Borovinka, Belle-Dame and Plodovitka, for example.
“It’s such a pity that these names have disappeared,” said Nikitina. “In Russian supermarkets these days, you either see foreign varieties, or they’re just marked ‘Russian’ or ‘seasonal’, with no names at all.” Nikitina wanted to start hunting down varieties of heritage fruit, specifically those that have connotations with Russian literature – such as the summer apple Arkad, Tolstoy’s favourite. But she didn’t have the expertise to do it alone.

Enter Isabella Dalla Ragione, an “arboreal archaeologist” from Perugia, Italy, who specialises in rescuing old fruit-tree varieties from extinction. She is helping to locate and identify heritage varieties so that an orchard of Russian apple trees can be grown on land purchased by Nikitina next to Dostoevsky’s family estate of Darovoye, not far from Kolomna. In addition to the collection, there will be a “fruit forest” and an experimental and educational garden, which among other things will provide edible flowers that can be sold to local restaurants.
Nikitina’s inspiration, she said, comes from Dostoevsky. In a diary entry from 1876 he wrote: “I’m not sure how all this will happen, but it will happen; there will be an Orchard. Mark my words: though it be a hundred years from now […] Humanity will be renewed in the Orchard, and the Orchard will restore it – that is the formula.”

Google suspends 'free speech' app Parler,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55598887,"Sat, 09 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Google has suspended ""free speech"" social network Parler from its Play Store over its failure to remove ""egregious content"".
Parler styles itself as ""unbiased"" social media and has proved popular with people banned from Twitter.
But Google said the app had failed to remove posts inciting violence.
Apple has also warned Parler it will remove the app from its App Store if it does not comply with its content-moderation requirements.
On Parler, the app's chief executive John Matze said: ""We won't cave to politically motivated companies and those authoritarians who hate free speech!""
Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among supporters of US President Donald Trump and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views.
While Mr Trump himself is not a user, the platform already features several high-profile contributors following earlier bursts of growth in 2020.
Texas Senator Ted Cruz boasts 4.9 million followers on the platform, while Fox News host Sean Hannity has about seven million.
It briefly became the most-downloaded app in the United States after the US election, following a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook.
However, both Apple and Google have said the app fails to comply with content-moderation requirements.
By Shayan Sardarizadeh, BBC Monitoring
For months, Parler has been one of the most popular social media platforms for right-wing users. 
As major platforms began taking action against viral conspiracy theories, disinformation and the harassment of election workers and officials in the aftermath of the US presidential vote, the app became more popular with elements of the fringe far-right.
This turned the network into a right-wing echo chamber, almost entirely populated by users fixated on revealing examples of election fraud and posting messages in support of attempts to overturn the election outcome.
In the days preceding the Capitol riots, the tone of discussion on the app became significantly more violent, with some users openly discussing ways to stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory by Congress. 
Unsubstantiated allegations and defamatory claims against a number of senior US figures such as Chief Justice John Roberts and Vice-President Mike Pence were rife on the app. 
Google and Apple say they are taking necessary action to ensure violent rhetoric is not promoted on their platforms. 
However, to those increasingly concerned about freedom of speech and expression on online platforms, it represents another example of draconian action by major tech companies which threatens internet freedom.  
This is a debate which is certain to continue beyond the Trump presidency. 
In a statement, Google confirmed it had suspended Parler from its Play Store, saying: ""Our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence.
""In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app's listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues.""
Apple has warned Parler it will be removed from the App Store on Saturday, external in a letter published by Buzzfeed News.
It said it had seen ""accusations that the Parler app was used to plan, coordinate, and facilitate"" the attacks on the US Capitol on 6 January.
Mr Matze said Parler had ""no way to organise anything"" and pointed out that Facebook groups and events had been used to organise action.
But Apple said: ""Our investigation has found that Parler is not effectively moderating and removing content that encourages illegal activity and poses a serious risk to the health and safety of users in direct violation of your own terms of service.""
""We won't distribute apps that present dangerous and harmful content.""

In a related development, Google has kicked Steve Bannon's War Room podcast off YouTube, saying it had repeatedly violated the platform's rules.
The ex-White House aide's channel had more than 300,000 subscribers.
Steve Bannon served as President Trump's chief strategist for eight months in 2017
""In accordance with our strikes system, we have terminated Steve Bannon's channel 'War room' and one associated channel for repeatedly violating our Community Guidelines,"" Google said in a statement.
""Any channel posting new videos with misleading content that alleges widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 US Presidential election in violation of our policies will receive a strike, a penalty which temporarily restricts uploading or live-streaming. Channels that receive three strikes in the same 90-day period will be permanently removed from YouTube.""
The action was taken shortly after the channel posted an interview with Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, in which he blamed the Democrats for the rioting on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.
One anti-misinformation group said the action was long overdue after ""months of Steve Bannon calling for revolution and violence"".
""The truth is YouTube should have taken down Steve Bannon's account a long time ago and they shouldn't rely on the labour of extremism researchers to moderate the content on their platform,"" said Madeline Peltz, Senior Researcher at Media Matters for America.

The KLF's songs are finally available to stream,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-55507226,"Fri, 01 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"After years of silence, The KLF have uploaded a selection of their most famous songs to streaming services like Spotify, YouTube and Apple Music.
The band's music has been officially unavailable since 1992, when they deleted their entire back catalogue.
But eight songs, including dance anthems like 3AM Eternal and What Time Is Love, are now available on an eight-track compilation, Solid State Logik.
Fly posters in London suggested The KLF would release more music this year.

Solid State Logik collects all of the band's biggest hits - including the Tammy Wynette collaboration Justified & Ancient, and the Gary Glitter-sampling Doctorin' The Tardis.
It comes 29 years after founders Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond turned their backs on music, with a provocative performance at the 1992 Brit Awards - where they tied for best group with Simply Red.
The duo made their disdain for the industry clear by performing 3AM Eternal while firing blanks from a machine gun into the stunned audience, before an announcer said: ""The KLF have left the music business.""
Driving the point home, they later dumped a dead sheep on the steps of an after-show party with a note reading, ""I died for ewe"".
Cauty and Drummond later burned £1m of their royalties in bundles of £50 notes, on the remote Scottish island of Jura.

In recent decades the duo have concentrated on book and art projects, including plans to build a ""people's pyramid"", inspired by the death of Cauty's brother and constructed from bricks, each containing 23 grams of human ashes.
But fans have clamoured for their music - with bootleg clips of their videos and performances achieving tens of millions of views on YouTube, and several ""sound-alike"" versions of their biggest hits appearing on Spotify.

Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra: Does stylus spell end of the Note?,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55649493,"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"The Galaxy S21 Ultra has hardware built into it to make use of the firm's S Pen stylus
Samsung's new flagship Galaxy S smartphone works with its stylus for the first time.
The S Pen is an optional add-on for the Galaxy S21 Ultra. But the move will fuel speculation the firm will phase out its separate Note handset range.
Samsung told the BBC it had yet to make a decision about this.
The company's handset sales have declined more quickly than the wider market. One expert said a streamlined line-up might help address this.
This video can not be played
WATCH: First look at Samsung's S21 Ultra phone
""There's increasing logic for Samsung to converge the Galaxy S and Note platforms, because there's so little differentiation between the two kinds of devices now,"" said Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy.
""That would align them with Apple, which also has one big phone launch event a year. 
""My concern is that every time Samsung has announced its Note products in the past, it has planted a seed in consumers' minds that the Galaxy S products have become kind of the old ones.""
The benefit of having a stylus is that it is easier to write, draw or annotate notes than using a finger. But to work it requires special hardware under the glass of the phone's display to pass power to the stylus and to track its tip.
The Android-based Galaxy S21 Ultra has a 6.8in (17.3cm) display, which is only slightly smaller than the top-end 6.9in Note. 
In years past, the Note phones were known as ""phablets"", and their size was the other key distinguishing factor with the S range.
Unlike the Note series, the S21 Ultra requires a special case to stow away the pen
Product manager Mark Notton said ""we haven't decided"", when asked whether Samsung planned to continue the Note family.
""It does not mean that Samsung is not committed to the Note category, but is expanding the Note experience across device categories,""  the firm said in a follow-up statement.
""We will actively listen to consumers' feedback and reflect it in our continued product innovation.""
The S21 Ultra will start at £1,149 when it goes on sale on 29 January. The S Pen costs an extra £35 on its own, or £85 when bundled with a case that stores it.
That puts it in the ballpark of the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra's £1,179 starting price, which comes with a stylus that slots into its body.
There are also two other lower-cost models in the new range, neither of which works with the S-Pen stylus: the 6.2in S21 and 6.7in S21+.
All three models feature a redesigned camera module on their back.
All the Galaxy S21 phones feature a redesigned camera module on their back
But while the two lower-end models have three lenses - ultra-wide, wide and 3x-zoom telephoto - the S21 Ultra adds a further 10x-zoom telephoto lens, letting owners shoot action from even further away.
The handsets also benefit from a new Director's View facility. It lets users film video while getting thumbnail previews superimposed on-screen of what it would look like if they switched to another lens.
All three phones can film in 8K - double the maximum resolution of the competing iPhone 12 range's native video app.
The Director's View mode lets users preview how the recorded shot will change in a video if they switch to a different lens while filming
Other benefits over Apple's latest phones include:
screens that can display up to 120 frames per second, to provide smoother visual effects
wi-fi 6E wireless connectivity, allowing use of extra radio bandwith with a compatible router
brighter screens - the S21 Ultra goes up to 1,500 nits, which should improve playback of HDR (high dynamic range) video
However, the handsets may be more notable for following Apple in two regards.
They have abandoned a slot for a microSD memory card.
And they will be sold without either a charger - a decision over which Samsung had mocked its rival., external - or earphones.
Samsung posted this ad in October on social media before deleting it
""We discovered that more and more Galaxy users are reusing accessories they already have,"" the firm said.
Samsung typically unveils its Galaxy range in late February, but has brought forward this year's launch to coincide with the CES tech show.
""Samsung needs S21 to be a success given that S20 was launched in the middle of Covid first wave in Europe and didn't gain many fans,"" commented Marta Pinto, from research firm IDC.
She added the earlier launch date could help it compete in the ""premium market"" with Apple, whose iPhones were released later than normal last year.
The South Korean firm should also benefit from collapsing sales of Huawei's devices in the West, caused by US sanctions that prevent them offering the Google Play store and some of the search giant's other services.
Samsung dedicated a segment of its Unpacked launch presentation to its partnership with Google
But Mr Wood said Samsung was facing growing competition from other Chinese brands including Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo.
""Samsung's differentiator is going to be its ability to market its strong brand, and the fact it has a very wide product portfolio,"" he commented.
Samsung also aims to widen its appeal with two further accessories.
It has a new pair of £219 wireless earbuds that monitor what the user is doing. 
Samsung's earbuds should automatically adapt their audio output according to what the user is doing
If they detect the wearer is talking, they automatically turn down the volume of music and amplify the sounds of the nearby environment picked up by their microphones, allowing the owner to have a brief conversation without needing to take them out or manually adjust their settings.
Samsung also is launching the £30 Galaxy SmartTag - a Bluetooth-enabled tracker that can be attached to belongings or pets. 
It will allow an app to show their location, so long as the tag is in range of the owner or anyone else's compatible Samsung device.
The tracker will compete with similar products from the current market leader Tile. 
The SmartTag will challenge Tile, which already sells a range of Bluetooth trackers
Apple is widely rumoured to be working on similar devices of its own.

Epic's bid to sue Apple over Fortnite in UK rejected,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56156799,"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"The maker of Fortnite, Epic Games, will not be able to take Apple to court in the UK as part of a high-profile row, a tribunal has ruled.
Fortnite was pulled from Apple and Google's app stores worldwide after it broke rules - which it claims are unfair - about in-app purchases.
Epic had wanted to take both US companies to court in the UK, alleging they broke competition law.
But the Competition Appeal Tribunal gave it permission to pursue Google.
That case will relate to specific claims about how Fortnite was pulled from Android's Google Play store.
The focus of the case was whether the ""out of jurisdiction"" US companies could be dealt with by British courts, which requires permission of the Tribunal.
All three companies are US-based.
Fortnite makes vast sums of money from in-app purchases, when players buy its virtual currency, V-Bucks.
But when a player did that on an iPhone or Android version of the game, Apple or Google took a 30% cut of the payment.
Epic had long argued such a cut was unfair, and inflated prices for players. So last year, it offered players the chance to buy the virtual currency direct from its own website, circumventing Apple and Google.
Apple removes Fortnite developer from App Store
Fortnite-maker sues Apple and Google in UK
That was explicitly against both companies' app store rules - so both removed Fortnite from their stores.
Epic had legal cases already prepared against both tech giants, along with an elaborate media campaign attacking Apple.
The judge, Justice Roth, said he was ""far from persuaded"" that the UK was the best place for the Epic-Apple dispute.
But Google was different, he found, for complex legal reasons, external involving the corporate structure, Google's Irish subsidiaries, and how much input the different branches of the two tech firms had in implementing the decisions.
On balance, Justice Roth found that the US divisions of Google were ""proper parties to those claims"".
Apple also has a presence in Ireland, but it was not involved in Epic's case.
The result leaves Epic in the position of being able to pursue Google in the UK, but not Apple - and Apple has been the main focus of its ire.
That is partly because Google's Android system is not as tightly locked down as Apple's, and Fortnite can still be downloaded to Android, with extra steps and bypassing security warnings.
But Epic Games highlighted that the tribunal said that if US courts would not rule on relief in the UK, that could be a ""powerful factor"" in revisiting the decision regarding Apple.
Epic Games said it was ""pleased"" about the decision regarding Google, and that it ""will reconsider pursuing its case against Apple in the UK after the resolution of the US case"".

Apple revamps syringe emoji for Covid vaccines,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56099162,"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Apple is changing its syringe emoji to remove the dripping blood, as it becomes widely used to talk about the Covid-19 vaccine.
Apple's new version has nothing inside the needle.
""This makes the emoji more versatile when used to describe Covid-19 vaccination,"" explained Emojipedia, a site that catalogues the icons.
The site reports a surge in the use of the syringe emoji last year to talk about the Covid vaccine.
Emojipedia, external said that while the syringe was once associated with blood donation, it saw a noticeable shift to it being used for vaccinations, alongside  other emoji such as a face mask or a microbe.
By December, the icon had become associated with words such as ""vaccine"", ""Covid-19"", ""Pfizer"", and ""Moderna"", it said.

Apple has not officially made any comment on the revised graphic.
But the change was discovered in the beta version for Apple's latest mobile operating system, iOS 14.5, which is likely to be available to ordinary users soon.
New emojis must be approved by industry body the Unicode consortium - but existing ones are designed slightly differently by companies such as Apple, making tweaks possible.
Google's Android has not announced any similar changes, but the major software makers usually converge on a similar design.
In 2016, Apple changed the pistol emoji from a handgun to a water pistol, with Google, Samsung, Microsoft and others eventually following suit.
The move was welcomed by the Royal Society for Public Health. It said Apple could play a part ""to increase confidence in Covid-19 vaccines"".
""We applaud everyone who joins in the global effort by doing what they can to reassure those who may be scared of needles or unnecessarily concerned about the vaccinations,"" chief executive Christina Marriott said.
The change comes as Apple also placed limitations on developers building ""vaccine passport"" apps - ones that entitle the bearer access to somewhere based on a Covid test or vaccine.
It said it had noticed an increase in such apps that generate ""passes"" used to access locations or services.
But such apps will no longer be allowed unless they are working with recognised public health authorities or companies associated with them.
That includes ""test kit manufacturers, laboratories, or healthcare providers"" as well as government and medical institutions, Apple said.
The change is designed ""to ensure these apps responsibly handle sensitive data and provide reliable functionality"".
It is the latest hurdle for so-called vaccine passports, which have long been proposed as an eventual alternative solution to lockdowns.
But on Wednesday, UK think tank the Ada Lovelace Institute, which looks at how big data affects society, warned that such a system could present a host of issues, external.
There appears to be growing momentum for a ""no jab, no job"" policy among some employers, but it's quite unlikely to happen in the short term and here's why. 
There are a host of technical, legal and political challenges for any company wanting to know about the vaccine status of their staff or customers. First, there is no officially recognised vaccine passport or certificate out there - and there is unlikely to be one until the government gives the go-ahead for any scheme to get access to NHS records. 
The Ada Lovelace Institute's report today warns against rushing out vaccine passports before there is clear evidence that a vaccinated person cannot pass on Covid-19 to someone else. Even when there is evidence, the report warns such a scheme could exacerbate mistrust in vaccines by making them appear mandatory.  
Lawyers say that treating employees who haven't been vaccinated differently could amount to discrimination, and data protection specialists say demanding to know someone's vaccine status may be against the law.

Apple buys a company every three to four weeks,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56178792,"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Apple chief executive Tim Cook
Apple has acquired about 100 companies over the last six years, the company’s chief executive Tim Cook has revealed.
That works out at a company every three to four weeks, he told Apple’s annual meeting of shareholders on Tuesday. 
Apple recently delivered its largest quarter by revenue of all time, bringing in $111.4bn (£78.7bn) in the first-quarter of its fiscal year 2021.
Mr Cook told the shareholders meeting that the acquisitions are mostly aimed at acquiring technology and talent.

Apple's largest acquisition in the last decade was its $3bn purchase of Beats Electronics, the headphone maker founded by rapper and producer Dr Dre.  
Another high profile purchase was music recognition software company Shazam, for $400m in 2018.  
Most often, Apple buys smaller technology firms and then incorporates their innovations into its own products. 
One example is PrimeSense, an Israeli 3D sensing company whose technology contributed to Apple’s FaceID. 
Apple has also invested in back-end technology that wouldn’t be so obvious to iPhone or Macbook users.
Apple's list of acquisitions and investments is extremely varied. 
In the past year, Apple has bought several artificial intelligence (AI) companies, a virtual reality events business, a payments startup and a podcast business, among others. 
In 2019, Apple bought Drive.ai, a self-driving shuttle firm, in an effort to boost its own foray into self-driving technologies.

In 2016, the company also took a $1bn stake in Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, although it wasn’t a controlling interest. 
Apple is an immensely profitable juggernaut worth more than $2trn, so it has plenty of money to make acquisitions. 
But even if it has bought 100 companies in six years, Apple appears to be very selective about what it buys. 
For example, Tesla founder Elon Musk recently revealed that he approached Mr Cook to buy the electric car business when it was struggling in 2013. 
Mr Cook didn't take the meeting, Mr Musk said.  
Measured by value, Apple’s acquisitions are actually far more restrained than those of many of its tech rivals. 
Microsoft paid $26bn for LinkedIn, Amazon paid $13.7bn for Whole Foods and Facebook paid $19bn for WhatsApp.
Apple’s ten largest purchases put together would still be worth far less than any of those deals.

Amazon: The unstoppable rise of the internet giant,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55927979,"Sun, 07 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Earlier this week we learned that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos will step down as chief executive of the e-commerce giant that he started in his garage nearly 30 years ago.
He will make way for Andy Jassy, currently head of Amazon's cloud computing business, to take day-to-day control. 
Billionaire Mr Bezos won't entirely give up the reins, however, instead assuming the role of executive chairman. 
Today, Amazon is one of the most valuable public companies on the planet, with Mr Bezos vying with Tesla's Elon Musk for the title as world's richest man.
What started as a small online book retailer has become a global phenomenon, spanning home delivery, cloud computing, advances in artificial intelligence, and the streaming of movies and sports. 
And that has brought Amazon much criticism, ranging from accusations it has contributed to the decline of the High Street to complaints about working conditions in its vast warehouses.
So how has the Amazon empire been built?
Amazon's innovation can be clearly seen in its financial results. 
In 2018, it became the world's second-ever public company to be valued at $1 trillion, after Apple, and today it has the third-highest market valuation in US, after Apple and Microsoft.
The huge success of the online giant is also evident in its revenue. 
Sales for 2020 reached $386bn, up from $280bn a year earlier. Net profit almost doubled to $21bn.
Mr Bezos's success has been driven by the firm's global expansion, but mainly by expanding into a wide variety of other sectors.
Video streaming services and devices, cloud services and most recently groceries (with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market) have allowed the company to compete directly with technology giants such as Facebook, Apple, Google and Netflix. 
And it all began with selling books.
""When we first started selling books four years ago, everybody said, 'Look, you're just computer guys and you don't know anything about selling books.' And that was true,"" said a young Jeff Bezos in 1999. 
New boss Andy Jassy has been with Amazon since 1997
However, the huge stockpiling space that the company had at the time in the US helped Amazon become a leader in the sector and enabled it to offer a wider selection of books than its bricks-and-mortar rivals. 
Then ebooks arrived and Amazon was smart enough to become a key player in that market too.
In the late 1990s, Amazon decided to start selling other goods, starting with music and DVDs. 
Soon, Mr Bezos's empire grew to include electronics, toys and kitchen utensils. 
The growing network of US warehouses helped extend what the company could offer, dramatically increasing its popularity with customers. 
Ten years later, Amazon had become the biggest online seller in the US and around the world.
Following the creation of Amazon Marketplace in 2000 - which opened the platform up to thousands of small businesses - Amazon felt the need to boost its delivery service for loyal customers. 
Amazon Prime was launched in 2005, offering quicker shipping for selected items. This boosted sales of all sorts of goods. 
More than 100 million paying customers are now members of subscription service Amazon Prime, which also offers video and music streaming. 
It is the second-largest paid membership programme in the world.
Amazon never forgot its bookselling origins. When ebooks started to become popular, Mr Bezos launched the Kindle in 2007, eventually becoming the global leader in the sector.
The Amazon smart devices department grew exponentially, facing fierce competition from Apple and Google in the early 2010s. 
Amazon, however, was the first company to launch a smart device: the Echo speaker, equipped with the firm's own artificial intelligence system, Alexa.
It is now the third-largest seller of smart devices in the US.
Today, the future of Amazon looks a bit more complicated than just selling products on the internet.
Having successfully dominated online retail, the firm has now set its sights on expanding its services - and perhaps surprisingly, into physical stores - to create a new way of shopping.

Billie Eilish: Will Gompertz reviews new film The World’s A Little Blurry ★★★★☆,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56176995,"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Billie Eilish: The World's A Little Blurry could so easily have been a bland hagiography that told us nothing about the singer-songwriter, her work, her family, or the music business. 
That it is not, and is instead a revealing and moving portrait of a young, vulnerable artist in the process of making her first album, is down to the notable skill of the documentary's director. 
R.J. Cutler isn't famous like Michael Moore is famous or Louis Theroux is famous or Asif Kapadia is famous. But he is one of the preeminent non-fiction storytellers working in the burgeoning medium of contemporary documentary film. Anyone who has watched The September Issue (2009), about the lead up to the publication of an edition of American Vogue, will know that he is a fine filmmaker. 
The September Issue was built around the strained relationship between Vogue editor Anna Wintour and its creative director, Grace Coddington. The upshot was a compelling insight into the sniffy opulence of high-end glossy magazines and the nature of the people who run them. 
He has pulled off the same trick with his 2hr 21min Billie Eilish: The World's A Little Blurry.
Once again, he is following the making of a major piece of content and those responsible for bringing it into the world. 
This time around it is watching the work-in-progress that becomes Eilish's debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? We witness its development as a lived experience for the teenage singer-songwriter and her immediate family. 
Given that the record company, the artist, her mum and dad, and assorted PRs will have been all over this project like a rash, it was never going to be a fly-on-the-wall exposé, a point about editorial control Eilish makes more than once by knowingly mugging to the camera and thereby making clear she is fully aware of, and complicit with, its presence.
But, such is the trust Cutler must have built with Eilish, Finneas - her older brother and creative collaborator - and their parents Maggie and Patrick, he was still able to produce a film with substance and something to say. 
It starts with a brief Billie backstory. 
She was born in Los Angeles in 2001 to two professional actors who were also keen musicians. They started their kids' music education almost immediately, as we see in a home movie clip of a proud dad holding baby Billie over a piano keyboard and playing it by gently bouncing her up and down on the keys. 
Billie Eilish learning to appreciate music from her father at a tender age
There is archive talent show footage, in which we see a very young Billie singing, Finneas providing harmony, her mum playing the guitar, and her dad on the keyboard. Maybe it is with the benefit of hindsight, but brand Billie appears to have been something Maggie and Patrick had envisaged from day one: a star not so much born as conceived by her parents. 
Both children were home-schooled and shown how to write and produce songs. They encouraged them to make music together, which they duly did, with Finneas's bedroom acting as their HQ. 
""My family is the reason I'm the way I am"" Billie says, over a clip showing her at around two years old sitting on a piano stool next to Finneas as their mother excitedly announces off-camera ""your first duet!"" 
Everything seems pretty laid back and really tense at the same time. The dream has become reality. Billie's career is taking off, record execs are sitting on Finneas's bed as he plays them a backing track while his little sister, sitting cross-legged at the end of the bed, sings while looking at the lyrics on her smartphone. 
Nobody says much, but everything you need to know about the music business is captured in that one scene.
The singer making music with her brother, Finneas in his bedroom, under the watchful gaze of music executives
The documentary centres on Billie as a 17-year-old, a year into which she packs what would fill two lifetimes for most people. 
She never stops: writing, touring, singing, practising, working, working, working on her album with Finneas. 
They tour Europe (with mum as a constant chaperone, which leads to some memorable scenes). Billie gets injured, she mentions having Tourette's syndrome; she falls in love. 
She tells us how she once dreamt truly, madly, deeply about Justin Bieber, and now guess what? He's facetiming her! 
Billie is overcome with emotion when she meets her childhood idol Justin Bieber
She says she dreamt of owning a matt black Dodge Challenger one day, and guess what? She's got one on the drive! 
Billie has everything, everything she could possibly have wished for. 
Everything. 
And yet, she is often miserable, frequently lonely, constantly dreads internet trolls, and is clearly under far too much pressure for someone so young. 
When you watch this documentary you realise Noel Coward knew a thing or two when he told Mrs Worthington not to put her daughter on the stage. 
His advice was based on the daughter being insufficiently gifted, which categorically does not apply to Billie Eilish, who is a generational talent. But, as we know from all the docs that have gone before that chart the careers of brilliant teenage artists, there is a heavy price to pay for a talent that gives pleasure to millions.
The gifted singer facing the pressures of fame, says at one point ""I can't have one moment where I'm like I don't want to do this""
Billie comes across as a lovely, caring person, with her own physical and psychological challenges to overcome. She has the courage to share some of her darkest thoughts and fears in her songs, she is an artist wearing her heart and soul on the sleeve of her record. 
There is a foreboding sense in this film of we've seen all this before, it is Act One of a three-act story. 
You can't help but think of the recently released Britney Spears documentary, she was a talented teenager who had a lot of parental input but whose life and mental health suffered under the pressure of fame and expectation. 
Turning a person into a product works for just about everybody except for the artist. It is the epitome of a Faustian pact, with an important exception: it is rarely the teenage prodigy who does the deal. 
Billie Eilish: The World's A Little Blurry is a refreshingly candid, intelligent documentary, if a little a long, which leaves you wondering if a life of relentless celebrity and trying to please everybody but yourself is actually a good plan. 
You wonder exactly whose dream is coming true? 
I found it sad rather than uplifting, but the music is exceptional and so is the woman making it. 
Billie Eilish: The World's A Little Blurry is available on Apple TV+

Hyundai: The carmaker aiming to become a tech firm,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55806568,"Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Hyundai's concept electric vehicle (EV) is called Prophecy
For a few weeks this year, South Korean carmaker Hyundai was dusted with the Apple magic.
Last month Hyundai let slip that it was in talks with the maker of the iPhone to co-operate on a car project, but this week it said the talks were over, external.
However, this is by no means the end of Hyundai's push into technology.
The car firm has been investing heavily in new technology with a string of partnerships, acquisitions and investments within the tech space.
Its takeover of robotics firm Boston Dynamics last year was a clear indication of the direction it is taking - into cutting-edge technology.
The whole auto industry has been forced to innovate as the move towards electric cars and autonomous vehicles accelerates.
Hyundai has been criticised in the past for lagging behind rivals in adopting emerging technologies but is fast catching up, sealing a string of alliances and investments with technology groups recently.
""Hyundai has a different set of motivations and more incentive to push the limit. They have been a lot more aggressive in reinventing themselves,"" says Dale Hardcastle, a partner at consultancy firm Bain.
Hyundai has built its own humanoid robot called DAL-e
Hyundai has been ramping up the electrification of its line-up of cars with a dedicated battery electric vehicle (BEV) range called Ioniq.
Its aggressive electric car ambitions will see it launch 12 new BEV models over the next four years, and fully electrify its line-up around the globe by 2040.
Beyond battery electric vehicles, Hyundai has been busy developing charging points and hydrogen refuelling stations. 
""It's very clear where Hyundai sees its future. It's a brand that wants to disrupt and push forward, to break up the status quo,"" says Mr Hardcastle.

The purchase of a majority stake in Boston Dynamics in a $1.1bn (£810m) deal in December was seen as a major step to becoming a leader in car technology. 
Boston Dynamics is a pioneer in consumer robotics, while it has a shared interest with Hyundai in autonomous driving and smart factories.
""Hyundai is being very responsive to the dynamic market trends,"" says Bakar Sadik Agwan, senior automotive consulting analyst at GlobalData.
""With the automotive industry getting more dynamic day by day due to the fast technological advancements, companies need to transform their business strategies to secure their position in the future mobility era. Hyundai seems to be well on track in this direction.""
Huawei is also working on its own smart car
The fact that Apple was considering a partnership with Hyundai shows how far the carmaker has advanced.
And there are plenty of other projects in the pipeline.
Electric vehicles, autonomous driving and even the potential for passenger drones are all possible projects for Hyundai and its sister company Kia.
""We are receiving requests for co-operation in joint development of autonomous electric vehicles from various companies, but they are at an early stage and nothing has been decided,"" Hyundai said.

""The stock market loves car companies who are tech firms, as seen with Tesla's rise,"" says Sarwant Singh, managing partner at analysts Frost & Sullivan.
""This partnership [with Apple] would have further highlighted Hyundai's position as a tech innovator.""
Many industry experts expect Hyundai to tie up with fellow South Korean conglomerate and tech giant Samsung in developing smart electric vehicles.
""Hyundai Motor Group is exploring areas of potential collaboration with diverse business partners around the world including Samsung Group, but there is no specific initiative we can identify at this time,"" Hyundai spokeswoman Jin Cha told the BBC.
""In line with this, we have our doors open to potential partners, particularly global companies which are global leaders in their respective domains.""
Hyundai, which means modernity in English, was founded by Chung Ju-yung in 1947. The group makes products across the motor, construction, steel and technology industries.
Mr Chung handed over the reins in 2000 to his son Chung Mong-koo who ran the company for 20 years before moving on to become honorary chairman last October. 
He was succeeded by his son Euisun Chung in a move many feel will give impetus to the world's fifth largest carmaker's push into electric vehicles.

Will the UK be ready for a 2030 ban on sales of petrol and diesel cars?
In a welcome speech Mr Chung, 49, said he hoped to bring about change at Hyundai during a period of rapid technological innovation within the global auto industry.
He identified autonomous driving, electrification, hydrogen fuel cells, robotics and urban air mobility (UAM) - industry jargon for flying cars - as his future initiatives.
""Carmakers need to prepare themselves for the future. By not exploring potential new business models, these companies are setting themselves up for obsolescence,"" says Sam Fiorani from AutoForecast Solutions.
The changes began just over a year ago when Hyundai signed a joint venture with self-driving technology firm Aptiv in a $4bn partnership named Motional. 
Ireland-based Aptiv supplies the technology that helps integrate data coming from the sensors that self-driving cars rely on.
""Automobile manufacturers need to become technology companies. The old model of just making and selling cars and trucks is disappearing and the future is so much more,"" adds Sarwant Singh at Frost & Sullivan.
Hyundai also has an ambitious plan to build, external electric air taxis and wants to get them flying by 2028.
Hyundai chairman Euisun Chung at the Consumer Electronics Show in 2020
A recent report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) looked at the prospects of tech companies like Apple and Google becoming significant carmakers in the future given their recent advances. 
Tech giant Google has its own self-driving unit called Waymo, which already makes commercial self-driving taxis, while it emerged in December that Huawei is working on its own smart car.
But BCG concluded that the reverse could happen instead. 
""The automakers that digitally reinvent the fastest, becoming a company that looks more like Apple or Peloton. 
""It could be argued that such automakers would have the scale to add themselves to the list of future tech giants.""
Hyundai is hoping to be one of them.

Hundreds of K-pop songs disappear from Spotify,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56237626,"Mon, 01 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Pop star IU is among the artists who are affected
Hundreds of popular K-pop songs have been removed from Spotify, amid a dispute with South Korean music distributor Kakao M.
Releases by popular acts including Sistar, IU, Monsta X and Epik High have vanished, leaving fans frustrated.
Spotify said its ""existing licensing deal"" with Kakao M had ""come to an end"" but it hoped the disruption would be temporary.
But the Korean company accused Spotify of refusing to extend its licence.
Kakao M is South Korea's top music distributor, responsible for 37.5% of the songs featured in the country's Top 400 Yearly Song Chart in 2020.
It also owns and operates the country's top music streaming service, MelOn, with 8.81 million monthly active users.
The dispute prompted anger from some of the artists whose work was affected.
""Why is it always the artists and the fans that suffer when businesses place greed over art?"" said Tablo, external, the leader and producer of hip-hop band Epik High.

He said the sudden removal of their most recent album, January's Epik High Is Here (Part 1), was ""against our will"".
The music remains available on services like Deezer and Apple Music.

The dispute illustrates the transient nature of subscribers' streaming libraries.
Although 60,000 songs are uploaded to Spotify every day, popular tracks can disappear overnight when the company's agreements with record labels and rights-holders expire. Users will then see songs ""greyed out"" in their playlists.
And it's not just Spotify - any streaming service can remove or replace music without notifying you as deals expire and are re-negotiated. 
We're more used to it on video-streaming apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where movies and TV shows shuffle on and off the menu on a monthly basis; but music streamers tend to offer a more stable library.
Epik High criticised the move
In a statement, Spotify confirmed Kakao M's music was no longer available worldwide. 
""Despite our best efforts, the existing licensing deal we had with Kakao M (which covered all countries other than South Korea) has come to an end,"" it said.
""The fact that we have not yet reached agreement on a new global deal is unfortunate for their artists, as well as for fans and listeners worldwide. It is our hope that this disruption will be temporary and we can resolve the situation soon.""
However, later that same morning, Kakao M countered with its own statement, external, in which it claimed that Spotify had been the one who chose not to renew their agreement, even after a request on Kakao M's part.
It suggested the move was linked to ongoing conversations over the availability of their music on the South Korean version of Spotify, which launched four weeks ago.
""Unrelated to the domestic contract, which we are still negotiating, we separately received notice of the expiration of our license on February 28, and we requested a renewal of our existing global contract.
""Due to Spotify's policy that they must proceed with the domestic and global contracts at the same time, our global contract has currently expired,"" it continued. 
""We are currently continuing our negotiations about the supply of music.""
Among the artists whose discographies have at least partially disappeared are IU, Seventeen, Nu'est, Mamamoo, Epik High, Monsta X, Apink, Zico, Block B,  Lovelyz, Brave Girls, CNBlue, Younha and many others.

'Most healthcare apps not up to NHS standards',https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56083231,"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"A firm which reviews healthcare apps for several NHS trusts says 80% of them do not meet its standards.
Failings include poor information, lack of security updates and insufficient awareness of regulatory requirements, said Orcha chief executive Liz Ashall-Payne.
The firm's reviews help determine whether an app should be recommended to patients by NHS staff.
There are about 370,000 health-related apps available online, Orcha said.
App developers can categorise their apps themselves and the ones reviewed by the firm include those tagged health, fitness and medical. 
So far, the firm has reviewed nearly 5,000 apps and found many poor examples, including:
A diabetes management app offering complex medical support without any back-up from experts
A physiotherapy app offering exercise plans without any visible input from professionals
An app to help smokers quit, which had not had security updates in more than two years
One of the criteria on which many apps fail is regulation, Orcha (Organisation for the Review of Care and Health Apps) says - although this can be unintentional, if developers don't realise what is required.
""Innovators can get a bad reputation and that can be unfair,"" says Liz Ashall-Payne.
""Imagine if you have experienced a challenge with your health or that a loved one and you just want to help others. You're coming at it with good intentions but you wouldn't necessarily know which regulation your product needs.""
And it is not necessarily straightforward.
Liz Ashall-Payne is a former speech and language therapist
Any app which offers to calculate medicine doses or timings, or diagnose injury or conditions is defined as a medical device. They require a CE quality mark, according to the government regulator the MHRA, external. 
But even if an app does not fall into that category, its developer may, depending on the service offered, still need to contact a national regulator: the Care Quality Commission (England), Healthcare Inspectorate (Wales), Healthcare Improvement (Scotland), or the Regulation and Quality Improvement Authority (Northern Ireland).
For example, an app offering access to a virtual doctor would need to be registered with the CQC in England, but AI or machine learning elements would not fall under its remit.
And busy healthcare professionals might not be able to check this either.
""As a healthcare professional, you just want to get good health apps to your patients,"" said Ms Ashall-Payne, a former NHS speech and language therapist. 
""But it's difficult to know which tools to recommend."" 
The NHS also has its own public-facing app library, external, containing apps vetted by its digital team NHSX, which carried out some work with Orcha.
Apple and Google have their own review process for allowing apps on their stores in the first place.
Google said in a statement that it reviewed all apps on a ""case-by-case basis"" and Apple says in its developer guidelines, external that medical apps ""may be reviewed with greater scrutiny"".
Apple also says apps which claim to take X-rays or measure things like blood sugar levels using data taken by the sensors on the device are banned.
Dr Jermaine Ravalier, from Bath Spa University, worked on an app aimed at helping NHS workers tackle mental health issues.
""Lots of apps are put together that are either poorly designed or not researched thoroughly enough,"" he said.
Ideally an app needs the input of a large sample of people living with the target subject, rather than a select few, or an individual, he said.
""One issue is the other side - once it's been designed, rather than rolling it out, check whether it's actually going to be effective.""

Why is there a chip shortage for computers and cars?,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55936011,"Thu, 04 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"For the most part they go unseen but computer chips are at the heart of all the digital products that surround us - and when supplies run short, it can halt manufacturing.
There was a hint of the problem last year when gamers struggled to buy new graphics cards, Apple had to stagger the release of its iPhones, and the latest Xbox and PlayStation consoles came nowhere close to meeting demand.
Then, just before Christmas 2020, it emerged the car industry was facing what one insider called, external ""chipageddon"".
New cars often include dozens of microprocessors - and manufacturers were quite simply unable to source them all. 
Toyota has since warned that its global vehicle production will be slashed by 40% in September 2021 as a direct result. 
And one technology company after another has warned they too face constraints.
Samsung is struggling to fulfil orders for the memory chips it makes for its own and others' products.
Samsung is one of the world's biggest chip manufacturers
And Qualcomm, which makes the processors and modems that power many of the leading smartphones and other consumer gadgets, has the same problem.
Like much else wrong with the world, the coronavirus is partly to blame.
Lockdowns fuelled sales of computers and other devices to let people work from home - and they also bought new gadgets to occupy their time off.
The automotive industry, meanwhile, initially saw a big dip in demand and cuts its orders.
As a result, chipmakers switched over their production lines.
But then, in the third quarter of 2020, sales of cars came roaring back more quickly than anticipated, while demand for consumer electronics continued unabated.
With existing foundries running at capacity, building more is not a simple matter, though.
""It takes about 18 to 24 months for a plant to open after they break ground,"" analyst Richard Windsor says.
""And even once you've built one, you have to tune it and get the yield up, which also takes a bit of time. 
""This isn't something you can simply switch on and switch off.""
The rollout of 5G infrastructure is also adding to demand. 
And Huawei put in a big order to build up a stockpile of chips before US trade restrictions blocked it from ordering more.
By contrast, the car industry is relatively low margin and tends not to stockpile supplies, which left it in a pinch.
General Motors plans to halt production at three North American plants and reduce work at a fourth, in South Korea
Recently, TSMC and Samsung, the leading chip producers, have spent billions getting a new highly complex 5-nanometre chip-manufacturing process up to speed to power the latest cutting-edge products. 
But analysts say more widely, the sector has suffered from under-investment.
""Most of tier-two foundries have been registering poor earnings, low margins and high debt ratio during the past few years,"" a report from Counterpoint Research, external said.
""From the profitability perspective, building a new fab[rication plant] for smaller foundries is difficult to consider.""
And many of these chip producers will instead respond to the extra demand by increasing their prices.
Experts do not expect chip scarcity to be resolved any time soon.
Chip designer Intel has warned that it could take two years to catch up with demand.
""We expect semiconductor industry supply constraints on both wafer and substrates to only partially ease in second-half 2021, with some leading-edge (computing, 5G chips) tightness to extend into 2022,"" a Bank of America research note says., external
And one chipmaker told the Wall Street Journal backlogs were now so big, it would take up to 40 weeks to fulfil any order a carmaker put in today, external.
This could have expensive knock-on effects.
The consultancy AlixPartners forecast the automotive industry will lose $64bn (£47bn) of sales because it has had to close or reduce output. 
Although, that sum needs to be viewed in the context of the sector typically generating about $2tn of sales a year.
There are also geo-political implications.
The US still leads in terms of developing the components' designs.
But Taiwan and South Korea dominate the chip-manufacturing industry.
Taiwan-based TSMC is the world's biggest semiconductors company
And TM Lombard economist Rory Green estimates the two Asian nations account, external for 83% of global production of processor chips and 70% of memory chips.
""Like Opec was for oil, Taiwan and South Korea are near monopoly producers of chips,"" he wrote, adding their market share was set to grow further,
That has raised concern in the States, where one lobby group called the current crisis, external the ""canary in the coal mine"" for future supply-line shortages.
And a group of 15 senators has written to President Biden urging him to take action, external to ""incentivise the domestic production of semiconductors in the future"".
But arguably the country most affected is China, which makes more cars than any other nation.
Research company IHS predicts 250,000 fewer vehicles will be produced in the country during the first three months of the year as a consequence., external
Beijing has long wanted to make the country more self-sufficient in semiconductors in any case.
But the US has taken steps to block local companies making use of American know-how to do so, on the grounds they also supply the Chinese military.
The current crisis will not only give China's leaders cause to redouble their efforts. 
It also exposes how disruptive another of their ambitions would be - unification with Taiwan.
For now, consumers planning a purchase need to bear a few things in mind.
Smaller brands may find it hardest to secure as much supply as they want
Waiting times for some car models will increase.
And some gadgets may also become hard to find.
The biggest players, such as Samsung and Apple, have the buying power to ensure they have priority.
But smaller brands may be disproportionately affected.
""That means products could get more expensive - or at least not fall in price over time as you would normally expect,"" Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy, says.
""And supply will be limited. 
""So if there's a gadget you really want to get, don't think about hanging around to see if there's a better deal in a few months' time.""

Racial Impostor Syndrome: When you're made to feel like a fake,https://www.bbc.com/news/stories-55909105,"Tue, 02 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"In December, Hilaria Baldwin - the podcaster, and wife of actor Alec Baldwin - was widely ridiculed for seeming to fake being Spanish. Korean-American student Arden Yum says that, like Hilaria, ethnic minority children may also identify with a different culture. But there are crucial differences, she suggests.
There is a TV clip showing her struggling to remember the English word for cucumber, she has a Mediterranean accent, and calls her children ""the Baldwinitos"". Plus, her husband told talk show host David Letterman, ""My wife is from Spain."" So understandably, many believed Hilaria Baldwin was Spanish.
It turns out Hilaria (she pronounces her name ""Ee-lah-ree-ah"") was born Hillary Hayward-Thomas. She grew up and went to school in Massachusetts, and went to university in New York. Her parents liked to holiday in Spain though, and retired there when she was in her late 20s.
There was a moment in December when Hilaria became one of the main topics of conversation - and humour - on social media. Comedian Amy Schumer called the episode ""insane and entertaining"", adding, ""You can't just pretend you're from Spain."" 
Actress Salma Hayek, who played Alec Baldwin's girlfriend on 30 Rock, was more sympathetic. ""We all lie a little bit,"" she said this week on talk show host Andy Cohen's  pop culture channel, Radio Andy. While Hayek is Mexican, her mother's ancestors were Spanish, she pointed out, adding that Hilaria was ""smart to want to be Spanish - we're cool.""
Defending herself on her Instagram page, Hilaria said, external: ""We celebrate both cultures in our home. Alec and I are raising our children bilingual, just as I was raised. This is very important to me. I understand that my story is a little different, but it is mine, and I'm very proud of it.""
She told the New York Times that identity was personal, external.
""Who is to say what you're allowed to absorb and not absorb growing up?"" she said.
On the surface, she could have been describing something that my friends and I have often spoken about - racial impostor syndrome. It occurs when your internal sense of self doesn't match with others' perception of your racial identity and gives rise to a feeling of self-doubt. It's usually experienced by people like me, living in countries where we are an ethnic minority. 
Arden set up The Peahce Project, a creative collective to explore Asian identity
My parents are Korean-Americans and I was born in New York city in 2002.
My younger brother and I grew up in Manhattan's crowded and lively streets. We moved around various neighbourhoods and played in local parks. We were lucky to experience childhood in this city filled with people from all backgrounds and of all ethnicities.
Some areas are more diverse than others, though. The Upper West Side, sandwiched between the Hudson river and Central Park, is quiet, residential, and affluent. It's also 68% white. When you picture glamorous TV shows such as Gossip Girl and Sex and the City, they're usually set in the Upper West or Upper East Side. 
I go to a predominantly white school, where most students are wealthy and privileged. When I was younger, I often felt defensive when my friends asked questions about the Korean food I ate or the Korean dramas that were playing on our TV when they visited. They weren't being insensitive, but I didn't want my Asian heritage to undermine the identity I presented at school.
The representation of Asians in American media recycles a handful of cliches. I'd see Mulan, a Disney princess-warrior, but I couldn't relate to her ferocity. And then there was the generic Asian kid in high school shows whose only purpose was to be the nerdy, shy side-kick with no storyline. They excelled at math. They played the violin. I resented their one-dimensionality.
Why feeling like a fraud can be a good thing
Things not to say to someone of mixed race
'I'm Hispanic but I can't speak Spanish'
At school, people often assumed that I would fit the stereotype of the shy Asian girl, and this became a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
I was afraid to raise my hand in class discussions, or to reach out to new classmates, and my self-confidence plummeted. I became silent. I thought that I had to withdraw and whitewash myself in order to fit in. I wanted to scrub clean all of the Asian parts of myself.
Even though I wasn't white, I wasn't considered fully Korean, either. I was trapped in what felt like an inescapable limbo. In seventh grade, a Chinese-American friend of mine used to lightheartedly call me a banana: white on the inside, yellow on the outside. I felt like an impostor. At the time, I hadn't ever been to Korea, and I couldn't speak more than five words in Korean. 
I was constantly questioning my identity - doubting that I belonged in either group: ""American"" or ""Asian"". 
But when I turned 15, everything changed. My family moved to Hong Kong for a year because of my mother's job with an art gallery. In my new adopted city and international school, I was fully immersed in a community with other Asian people for the first time. There were people from China, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea in my grade. Even though I had grown up in the US, I no longer looked or felt like an outsider. 
At lunchtime, my friends and I would sit on the landing of a staircase at the front of our school and pull out our bento boxes of home-cooked Asian food, which we ate with brightly coloured chopsticks. For once I wasn't carefully unpacking the racial undertones of every interaction. We went to the beach on the south side of Hong Kong, went out to eat dim sum and listened to local bands.
Memories of Hong Kong replayed in my head when I returned to New York and decided to create The Peahce Project, a platform for Asian voices in the form of interviews, art, writing and podcasts, external. When quarantine began in March 2020, our Instagram page started getting a lot more engagement, and one topic that connected with our audience was racial impostor syndrome.

Many people with immigrant parents seemed to identify with the concept of feeling like their internal identity is in conflict with what others perceive them to be. 
America has a long history of assigning identity, often making people of colour question themselves. A good example of this is the introduction of ""blood quantum"" for Native American tribes.
Brett Chapman says racial impostor syndrome was forced on many minority communities in the US
""Blood quantum is a system of calculating blood introduced by the federal government in the early 19th Century as a means of restricting the rights of Native American,"" says attorney Brett Chapman, whose relative Standing Bear was the first Native American to win civil rights for his tribe in the United States. 
The idea of blood quantum was then adopted by some Native Americans themselves. Florida's Miccosukee Tribe, for example, requires someone to have 50% tribal blood in order to qualify as a member. This led many to question their identity, says Brett.
Native American children were also separated from their tribes and forced to assimilate with white Americans and adopt their values, he adds. ""Which meant that racial impostor syndrome was forced upon them. People were made to change who they were, and then feel divorced from their tribe.""
Maybe Hilaria Baldwin's internal identity is in conflict with the way others perceive her? Identity is fluid and people of any race can feel a kinship to a culture that they're not part of. But her experience is clearly very different from the experience of a person of colour in the US, or that of someone who looks Asian but has been brought up in New York.
To me it's inappropriate for a privileged white person to adopt the identity of a Hispanic in the US. Hilaria Baldwin evidently identifies as Spanish rather than Mexican, Puerto Rican or Cuban, but most Spanish-speakers in the US are from these places, or from Central America - and according the Pew Research Center more than half say they have experienced discrimination, external. A white person who passes as Hispanic never has to worry about this. 
Many of us don't have whiteness as a safety net. 
The way to address racial impostor syndrome is to open more spaces for us to tell our own stories and share our unique experiences. It's more complex than stereotypes about maths prodigies and shy kids. 
As told to Megha Mohan, BBC gender and identity correspondent

Google Play store to cut fees for Android app developers,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56415621,"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Google plans to reduce the fees it charges to feature Android apps within its Play store.
From 1 July, it will take a 15% cut from the first $1m (£720,000) in sales each year of the apps and any digital goods and services sold within them, rather than its current 30% commission.
It follows a similar step announced by Apple in November.
Regulators are investigating both of the big tech companies following claims of anti-competitive practices.
The situation for Google is slightly different in that it allows rival app stores to work on its mobile platform, and also makes it easier to install software by other means.
However, the fact that the Play store remains most Android phones' default option may be judged to give it an unfair advantage.
Games developer Epic is among those to have argued that both Apple and Google charge ""exorbitant"" fees, external.
Gamers can buy books and movies about the game Fortnite, but not download the app itself from Google's Play store because of a row over fees
In a blog, Google's vice president of product management defended its charges on the grounds that the company provided marketing tools and other resources to help developers succeed.
But Sameer Samat acknowledged taking developers' ""input into account"" over the matter.
The firm said 99% of global Android developers did not earn over $1m a year, so would benefit from a 50% reduction in fees.
Those that do earn more should find the scheme to be more generous than Apple's, it added.
Apple investigated over 'unfair' App Store claims
Fortnite-maker sues Apple and Google in UK
Apple slashes fees to indie app developers
Google's 15% rate will apply to the first $1m of sales a developer makes each year regardless of their total earnings, with the remainder subject to the 30% fee.
By contrast, Apple only offers a 15% rate if a developer's net sales fall below $1m. As soon as they surpass that limit, all earnings are subject to the higher charge.
Apple issued the latest defence of its own practices on Monday, when it said more than 330,000 jobs in the UK alone, external were supported by its App Store.
It's a fast-growing industry, key to the infrastructure of the digital economy - and dominated by two giants which control access and prices. 
In any other business than mobile apps - say electricity or communications networks - you would expect such a duopoly to be subject to strict regulation.  
But until recently Google and Apple have felt free to do what they want.
Now they have had to respond to pressure from developers for a better deal - though it's doubtful if they'd have acted if regulators, particularly in the EU, had not begun to show an interest. 
Google appears to have outbid Apple when it comes to cutting fees for developers. But both companies can easily afford to be more generous. 
It's estimated that mobile app revenues grew by 30% in 2020 - and the tech giants took a healthy slice of that. 
Don't expect the Brussels regulators to step back and say ""job done"".

Microsoft's Cortana silenced as Siri gets new voice,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56602321,"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"The voice assistant is saying goodbye to mobile users
Cortana, Microsoft's virtual assistant designed to compete with Apple's Siri and Google's Assistant, is to be retired on mobile.
Instead it will focus on offering productivity help in Windows 10, Outlook and Teams.
The hashtag #RIPCortana was being used on Twitter, as people reminisced - or in some cases pointed out how forgettable the assistant had been.
Meanwhile, Apple's Siri will no longer default to a female voice in English.
The use of a female voice for virtual assistants has long been controversial for gender-typing a helpful, virtual companion.
Cortana was unveiled in 2014 as a virtual assistant for Windows phones. It was named after the advanced artificial intelligence guide in Microsoft's then best-selling Halo game series.
Three years later, Microsoft abandoned its smartphone operating system, although Cortana remained available for iPhones and Android devices.
The death of the voice assistant on most platforms was announced last summer and in January, Microsoft ended support for Cortana integration in the Harman Kardon Invoke speaker. It offered speaker owners who used Cortana, a $50 Microsoft gift card.
Cortana failed to catch up with the popularity of Amazon Alexa and Google's Assistant
Ben Wood, chief analyst at research firm CSS Insight said: ""There was a certain inevitability to Microsoft abandoning the consumer-centric variant of Cortana. Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant are the mass market voice assistants of choice, leaving little space for rivals. 
""Even the mighty Apple has struggled to get traction with Siri despite making huge investments to drive the platform forward.
""Microsoft has made a sensible decision to double down on Cortana as a platform to aid productivity gains, closely tied to its business-centric tools and services. Increasingly Cortana will become deeply integrated into specific Microsoft platforms, rather than being a generic voice assistant designed to be all things to all people.""
Rival Apple has added two new voices to its assistant Siri, as well as eliminating the default female voice in the latest version of iOS.   
In 2019 a report by UNESCO, external suggested that using female voices by default for voice assistants ""sends a signal that women are obliging, docile and eager-to-please helpers available at the touch of a button or with a blunt voice command"".
Apple said of its decision to put the onus on users to choose the voice of its assistant: ""This is a continuation of Apple's commitment to diversity and inclusion, and products and services that are designed to better reflect the diversity of the world we live in.""
In some countries and languages, Siri already defaults to a male voice.

In 2011, archaeologists found something unusual in a Roman toilet.
The team were excavating the ancient village of Tasgetium (now Eschenz, Switzerland), ruled by a Celtic king who was personally given the land by Julius Caesar. It was built on the banks of the river Rhine, along what was then an important trade route – and as a result, its remains have been steeped in water ever since. What should have rotted away centuries ago was uncovered in a remarkable state of preservation, protected by the lack of oxygen in the boggy conditions.
It was here that, nestled among the remains of familiar foods such as plums, damsons, cherries, peaches and walnuts in an ancient cesspit, the archaeologists found 19 curiously large seeds. Though they were, let's say, ""deposited"" there nearly 2,000 years ago, they almost looked fresh enough to have been found yesterday – except that the fruit they belong to is now so obscure, it can baffle even professional botanists.
The polite, socially acceptable name by which it's currently known is the medlar. But for the best part of 900 years, the fruit was called the ""open-arse"" – thought to be a reference to the appearance of its own large ""calyx"" or bottom. The medlar's aliases abroad were hardly more flattering. In France, it was variously known as ""la partie postérieure de ce quadrupede"" (the posterior part of this quadruped), ""cu d'singe"" (monkey's bottom), ""cu d'ane"" (donkey's bottom), and cul de chien (dog's bottom)… you get the idea.
And yet, medieval Europe was crazy about this fruit.
The fruit made regular appearences in artworks, such as this tapestry from around 1500 (Credit: Alamy)
The first record of the medlar's existence is a fragment of Greek poetry from the 7th Century BC. Eventually the fruit is thought to have fallen into the hands of the Romans, who brought it to southern France and Britain. In 800AD, Charlemagne included it on a list of plants that were mandatory in the king's many gardens, and nearly 200 years later, the English abbot and writer Ælfric of Eynsham first committed its rather rude sobriquet to the public record.
From there, the fruit's popularity steadily increased. It became a staple of medieval monasteries and royal courtyards, as well as public spaces such as village greens.
It's featured in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, and the two-time queen consort Anne of Brittany's Book of Hours – a kind of illustrated religious manuscript popular in the Middle Ages. Henry VIII had the medlar planted at Hampton Court, and gifted his French counterpart with large quantities.  
The fruit reached its peak in the 1600s when it was widely grown across England – as ordinary as apples, pears, mulberries and quince. From this lofty pinnacle, it underwent a steady decline. It was still widely known until the early 20th Century, though less celebrated. Then in the 1950s it abruptly vanished from the public consciousness altogether.
Once a household name, described by one Roman commentator as amounting ""almost to a craze"", now the medlar is primarily grown as a romantic relic from the past – a niche plant for eccentric gardeners and a historical curiosity at palaces and museums.
Just a few decades after it disappeared, it was already mysterious to many greengrocers. In 1989, one American academic wrote that ""probably not one in a hundred"" botanists had seen a medlar. Today it's not sold at a single British supermarket. Where there are still plants growing in public spaces, they often go unrecognised and are left to rot on the ground.
What was it about this strange fruit that gripped medieval Europe, and why did it disappear?
Medlar trees are unfussy and long-lived, with even the most venerable specimens producing hundreds of fruit each year (Credit: Alamy)
It's not known for sure where the medlar originated, but some believe that it was domesticated around 3,000 years ago in Western Asia, by the Caspian Sea – where there are many different types to this day.
""Medlar"" and ""open-arse"" can be used to refer to both the fruit and the shrub-like tree on which it's grown, Mespilus germanica – a close relative of roses, crab apples, and quinces. With a tangle of twisted, contorting branches at the base and a satisfying rounded canopy of elongated leaves, it was not only renowned for its fruit, but its aesthetic. Each spring, this is studded with single, star-shaped flowers which appear at such regular intervals that they could almost be painted on. By the autumn, the tree is a kaleidoscope of colours – green, yellow, brown and blood red.
You might also like:
The fruit are unusual for two reasons. Firstly, they're harvested in December – making them one of very few sources of sugar that would have been available in medieval winters. Secondly, they only become edible when they're rotten.
When they're first picked, medlars are greenish brown and resemble oddly-shaped onions or alien-looking persimmons. If they're eaten straight away, they can make you violently ill – one 18th Century doctor and botanist said that they cause diarrhoea. But if you put them in a crate of sawdust or straw and forget about them for several weeks, they gradually darken and their hard, astringent flesh softens to the consistency of a baked apple.
The exact chemical mechanism involved remains elusive, but broadly, enzymes in the fruit break down complex carbohydrates into simple sugars such as fructose and glucose, and it becomes richer in malic acid – the main culprit behind the sour taste of other fruits such as apples. Meanwhile, harsh tannins, which contribute to the bitter astringency of younger red wines, and antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (Vitamin C), are depleted.

The process is known as ""bletting"", a word made-up by a botanist who noticed there wasn't one in 1839. The result is an ultra-sweet fruit with a complex flavour, like over-ripe dates mingled with lemons, and a slightly grainy texture. ""When they are perfectly ripe, they are absolutely delicious to eat on their own,"" says Jane Steward, who planted 120 medlar trees at her Norfolk orchard in 2015 – possibly the largest collection in the UK.
However, if rotten fruit doesn't sound particularly enticing to you, you're in good company. In fact, even when the fruit was at its height of popularity, it still divided opinion.
A humorous research paper from 1989 gathered together some classic put-downs, including ""At best, it is only one degree better than a rotten apple"" – from a 19th Century gardening book – and ""the medlar is not… worth a turd until it's ripe, and then it tastes like shit"" – reportedly the opinion of an anonymous medieval author.
Then there's the question of how to eat a medlar. In less genteel company, people would have simply held one up to their face and sucked the flesh out directly. On the other hand, in aristocratic circles the fruit was commonly brought to the table along with the cheese course – still coated in the sawdust in which it was bletted – and scooped out with a spoon. It could also be baked, roasted, made into jelly, added to tarts, or turned into brandy or cider.

Apart from the obvious sexual allusions that can be made with a fruit with so many vulgar nicknames, it's thought that the medlar's quirky need for rotting partly explains why they made it into so many literary works – medieval audiences lapped up the symbolism of a fruit that is rotten before it's ripe. In Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, he draws a comparison with the fruit – ""But if I fare as dooth an open-ers"" – to lament the onset of old age and how he doesn't think men achieve their full ability to lie, boast, covet and become angry until they're weakened and elderly. 
However, bletting may also have been the medlar's downfall. The fruit was still a familiar winter staple throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and during World War Two, the British government encouraged people to forage for it – it's included in this Dig For Victory jam-making advice. Then soon afterwards, it vanished from the shops forever.
One possible reason is that tropical fruits such as bananas and pineapples became cheaper, and these are harvested year-round, so there was no longer any need for this winter delicacy.
But Steward's experiences in the industry also hint that the awkward extra step of bletting, combined with the fact that no one wants to spend days outside picking fruit in the winter, may have helped to finish it off. ""We have romantic notions about sunny days and wicker baskets and open toe sandals in this country – not standing around on short-daylight days harvesting fruit,"" she says. 
Today medlar trees can still be found scattered across Europe, sometimes posing as hedges in the countryside or ornamental trees in gardens – they're still there, but they have to be tracked down. Steward's personal favourite was planted at Langley Abbey in Norfolk in around 1820. ""It's still pushing out fruit 200 years later – it's breathtakingly beautiful,"" she says.
Each medlar fruit contains four or five large stones (Credit: Alamy)
But this is not quite the end of the story.
In the medlar's native territory near the Caspian Sea, the fruit remains as popular as ever. It's still widely grown in Iran, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia and Turkey, where it's sold in markets as musmula. Steward says she once received a message from a Kyrgyzstani family who had moved to England and were desperate to recreate the experience of foraging for wild medlars that they had to leave behind.
The plant also has a long history as a folk medicine in the region. In the rural province of Gīlān in northern Iran, medlar leaves, bark, fruits and wood are traditionally used to treat a range of ailments, such as diarrhoea, stomach bloating and menstrual irregularities.
Intriguingly, this is similar to how it was used in medieval Europe. The 17th Century botanist and doctor Nicholas Culpeper wrote that the medlar could be help women ""when their courses flow too abundant"", and a poultice made from the dried fruit, beaten and mixed with cloves, nutmeg, red coral and the juice of red roses could be applied to ease the stomach.    
Fast-forward to 2021, and the medlar is now not quite so little-known in Europe as it once was. It's begun quietly sneaking back into public awareness – largely thanks to the efforts of enthusiasts such as Steward, who markets her own range of medlar products, including jam and gin.
If the trend continues, perhaps the fruit will soon have a new generation of unspeakable names to go by.

Intel chief Pat Gelsinger: Too many chips made in Asia,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56512430,"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Pat Gelsinger plans to make Intel a major supplier to third-party chip designers
Intel's new chief executive has told the BBC it is not ""palatable"" that so many computer chips are made in Asia.
The majority of processors are currently manufactured in the region, with Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's Samsung the dominant players.
US-based Intel plans to set up a new division to make chips for other companies based on their own designs.
Until now, its focus had been on manufacturing its own chips in its factories across the world.
Pat Gelsinger has said Intel will invest $20bn (£14.6bn) in two new fabrication plants in the US state of Arizona, in addition to a major expansion of an existing Irish facility in County Kildare.
""Having 80% of all supply in Asia simply isn't a palatable manner for the world to have its view of the most critical technology,"" Mr Gelsinger said.
""Every smartphone, every telemedicine, every remote worker, every remote education, every autonomous vehicle, every aspect of humanity is becoming more digital. 
""And when it becomes digital, it runs on semiconductors. 
""This is the heart of every aspect of human existence going forward. And the world needs a more balanced supply chain to accomplish that. We're stepping in.""
Intel says the expansion of its facility in Leixlip, County Kildare, will create 1,600 permanent jobs
He added that Intel also intended to build a further chip-making foundry in a different European nation, but would not be drawn about exactly where.
While these moves will be too late to tackle an existing shortage of chips which is causing problems for car-makers and others, they could help the West avert a future crisis.
Politicians in the US and the EU have called for more chip-producing factories to be built locally.
This is partly driven by concerns that Beijing aims to reunify mainland China with Taiwan, while North Korea poses a threat to its southern neighbour.
However, Intel has repeatedly missed manufacturing targets over recent years.
As a consequence, its latest desktop processors use older transistor technology than rival silicon from AMD and Apple, putting the components at a disadvantage.
Mr Gelsinger must now prove his company has put these problems behind it if the new business is to thrive.
The 60-year-old only returned to Intel last month after his predecessor was ousted over concerns about falling market share, among other problems.
Chip manufacturing requires dust-free environments so the transistors and circuits are not damaged
But earlier in his career, Mr Gelsinger spent three decades at Intel, including a role as its first chief technical officer.
One activist investor had pressed him to go ""fab-less"", and spin off Intel's plants to concentrate on chip designs.
But Mr Gelsinger has instead chosen what looks like a tougher challenge in order to restore the company to its past glories.
And that includes letting clients order chips that mix together their own technologies with some of Intel's own architectures for an extra fee.
""We're putting it all on the table,"" he said.
The following interview has been edited for clarity and brevity:

WATCH: Pat Gelsinger says he hopes Apple will be among third parties to get Intel to make their chips
Let's start with the new Intel Foundry Services business. It sounds like you're going all out to make chips for other companies who lack the facilities to do so themselves. But why help the competition?
Manufacturing is a capacity game. And if you're not leading in terms of total capacity, you will fall behind. So to some degree it's a necessity. If we're going to be in the manufacturing business, we have to be a foundry for ourselves and for others.
Simply put, the world needs more semiconductors. 
We're in an environment where digitisation was at a strong pace of growth. And then Covid kicked us into a dramatically different gear. 
The world needs more semiconductors, and we're one of the few companies that have leading-edge technologies to be able to step into that void. And to keep it for our own products simply is not the right thing for the planet, for the industry, and for a globally distributed supply chain.
How disruptive do you think it will be, coming in to take business away from Samsung and TSMC?
Overall I think everybody is groaning to catch up to the overwhelming demand. And we're going to use Samsung and TSMC for some of our products. 
So this is about ""co-op-petition"". We expect to have strong partnerships with them as customers, and in some cases we'll compete a little bit. But overall, this is a rapidly growing $100bn market segment that simply needs more supply. 
It also needs more geographically balanced supply. 
Today there's a heavy bias to Asia. And as we've seen, coming out of some of the disruptions and challenges, the world needs US and European supply in a more balanced way. It's the right thing for the global supply chain requirements, for both commercial as well as for government and defence use as well.
You also have a large chip plant in Dalian, China. Are there any plans to build new ones in China?
At this point, we have no expansion plans for what we have there. 
The announcement yesterday was for two new fabs in Arizona. I already have construction projects going on in Oregon, Ireland and in Israel.
And we announced that we expect to open our next sites, in both Europe and the US, within the next year. So at this point, four major sites under construction, and I hope to add two more within the next year.
When you say you want to build more in Europe, is that going to just be more in Ireland or Israel? Or are you looking at other countries, the UK perhaps?
I fully expect that we'll open up a site in another country in Europe.
Could that be the UK?
I'm not going to speculate any further right now. 
But just to put this in context: these are extraordinary capital investments. They're also extraordinary job generators. 
You've said you hope Apple might be one of your clients, despite its decision to stop using Intel's own chips. Is that realistic?
Everybody wants multiple suppliers. So we think there's very real potential. But I have to earn that business. I have to be able to go to my competitors and be able to say: ""I want you to become my customer."" 
That also includes Nvidia, Qualcomm and Broadcom, in addition to Microsoft and IBM. I want all of them to say: ""I need more technology... and I trust that Intel is going to become one of my key suppliers.""
And that includes Apple as one of the biggest users of advanced semiconductor capabilities.
Intel is running a series of ads in which Mac computers come off worse against PCs powered by Intel chips
Apple can be a little thin-skinned at times. So is it wise to be running a high-profile ad campaign mocking its computers at the same time as saying we'd like to be your partner again?
We have great respect for Apple as a company. They're an innovator. They've done incredible things in the industry. Tim Cook is a great leader.
At the same time, we're going to be aggressive competitors and we're out to reinvigorate the PC ecosystem.
So we're going to enjoy ourselves. We're going to compete aggressively. And I'm also going to take care of my customers.
Regarding your own chips, you say you've now mastered your seven nanometre process, which roughly equates to what TSMC and Samsung market as 5nm. But we've heard promises from Intel before, and then things have slipped. What's different this time?
We've understood the core issues. What really happened was problems with our 10nm effort caused a domino delay to 7nm. 
There's an advanced manufacturing technique called extreme ultraviolet lithography. It was immature, and we bet against it. As we shifted in time, it became more mature. Now we've embraced it fully.
It's the same thing that TSMC is doing, and leveraging it aggressively.
TSMC is currently the world's leading supplier of computer chips
So we feel that we're now in a very predictable pace. 
I have confidence that we're back on track. But not just for 7nm. Our programmes that go for several nodes beyond that are showing very good success. 
We've also announced a research partnership with IBM. So, we have a rich portfolio of tricks and ideas and innovations to choose from to put us on a course for the long-term leadership of Intel.
When you say leadership, just to be clear, do you think you could overtake TSMC and Samsung in chip-making capabilities?
Intel led the semiconductor industry for 20-plus years in innovation.
We hit a pothole. We're now digging our way out of that pothole. And I'm looking forward to decades of continued leadership in this area.
Parity. Parity-plus. And then sustained leadership. That's the path that we're on.

Xiaomi to invest $10bn in electric vehicle race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56585697,"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Chinese phone maker Xiaomi is wading into electric vehicles with a $10bn (£7.3bn) investment over ten years. 
The Chinese tech giant's goal is to ""offer quality smart electric vehicles,"" it said on Tuesday.
Xiaomi is the world's third largest smartphone maker behind Apple and Samsung, according to data firm Canalys.   
The company will be entering a fiercely competitive electric car market that also includes rivals Apple and Huawei.

China's Baidu and Geely partner up for smart cars
Xiaomi will set up a wholly-owned subsidiary with an initial investment of about $1.5bn, with the company's chief executive Lei Jun heading up the new venture. 
""The decision was made after numerous rounds of deliberation among all our partners, and this will be the final major entrepreneurial project of my life,"" he said in a statement. 
So far, the company has given no indication about whether it will produce budget models or target the top end of the market. 
There are already hundreds of companies in China jostling for a share of the world's leading market for electric cars. 
Hyundai's concept electric vehicle (EV) is called Prophecy
Planned or existing models in China range from the tiny Hong Guang Mini EV, which retails for $4,500 to the new high-end electric brand Zeekr, which is owned by China's biggest carmaker Geely. 
Foreign manufacturers are also looking to build EVs for Chinese consumers. 
Tesla is already delivering its Model Y to China from its Shanghai factory, while Ford has plans to manufacture the electric version of its Mustang there.  
Other Chinese technology companies have also signalled their intention to make cars, or to partner with existing carmakers to produce new driving technologies. 
Search engine giant Baidu announced in January it would also launch an electric car business.    
China's e-commerce giant Alibaba has formed an EV joint venture with SAIC, while ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing has partnered with automaker BYD to make electric vehicles specifically designed for its services.
Data provider S&P Global Platts estimates that ""new energy vehicles"" will account for 20% of total new car sales in China by 2025.

Teen 'mastermind' pleads guilty to celeb Twitter hack,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56429204,"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Graham Ivan Clark was arrested on 30 charges
A US teenager has pleaded guilty to hacking several high-profile Twitter accounts in a large-scale Bitcoin scam.
Graham Ivan Clark was 17 when he co-ordinated the scam - which hijacked the profiles of celebrities, including Kim Kardashian West, Kanye West, Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Barack Obama.
He would spend three years in prison as part of his plea deal, a Florida court filing said.
But Clark has already served 229 days of this three-year sentence.
Now 18, but sentenced as a ""youthful offender"", he may also be able to serve some of the sentence at a boot camp, the Tampa Bay Times reported. , external
But Clark will also be banned from using computers without permission and supervision from law enforcement.
The hack, on 15 July last year, promoted a scam in which hijacked celebrity accounts encouraged followers to donate bitcoin to coronavirus-relief projects.
""Everyone is asking me to give back,"" a tweet purportedly sent from Mr Gates's account said. ""You send $1,000, I send you back $2,000.""
More than $117,000 (£84,200) of the cryptocurrency was collected through the scam.
The money had been handed to the authorities to be returned to the victims, Clark's lawyer said.
Technology companies Apple and Uber were also hacked
It was alleged Clark had imitated a member of Twitter staff to gain access to the company's networks and worked with two other hackers to complete the heist.
Nima Fazeli, 22, of Orlando, and Mason Sheppard, 19, of Bognor Regis, have been charged with federal crimes.
The family of Mr Sheppard have declined to comment and the Home Office said it ""does not comment on extradition requests"".

Hundreds of K-pop songs disappear from Spotify,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-56237626,"Mon, 01 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Pop star IU is among the artists who are affected
Hundreds of popular K-pop songs have been removed from Spotify, amid a dispute with South Korean music distributor Kakao M.
Releases by popular acts including Sistar, IU, Monsta X and Epik High have vanished, leaving fans frustrated.
Spotify said its ""existing licensing deal"" with Kakao M had ""come to an end"" but it hoped the disruption would be temporary.
But the Korean company accused Spotify of refusing to extend its licence.
Kakao M is South Korea's top music distributor, responsible for 37.5% of the songs featured in the country's Top 400 Yearly Song Chart in 2020.
It also owns and operates the country's top music streaming service, MelOn, with 8.81 million monthly active users.
The dispute prompted anger from some of the artists whose work was affected.
""Why is it always the artists and the fans that suffer when businesses place greed over art?"" said Tablo, external, the leader and producer of hip-hop band Epik High.

The dispute illustrates the transient nature of subscribers' streaming libraries.
Although 60,000 songs are uploaded to Spotify every day, popular tracks can disappear overnight when the company's agreements with record labels and rights-holders expire. Users will then see songs ""greyed out"" in their playlists.
And it's not just Spotify - any streaming service can remove or replace music without notifying you as deals expire and are re-negotiated. 
We're more used to it on video-streaming apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime, where movies and TV shows shuffle on and off the menu on a monthly basis; but music streamers tend to offer a more stable library.
Epik High criticised the move
In a statement, Spotify confirmed Kakao M's music was no longer available worldwide. 
""Despite our best efforts, the existing licensing deal we had with Kakao M (which covered all countries other than South Korea) has come to an end,"" it said.
""The fact that we have not yet reached agreement on a new global deal is unfortunate for their artists, as well as for fans and listeners worldwide. It is our hope that this disruption will be temporary and we can resolve the situation soon.""
However, later that same morning, Kakao M countered with its own statement, external, in which it claimed that Spotify had been the one who chose not to renew their agreement, even after a request on Kakao M's part.
It suggested the move was linked to ongoing conversations over the availability of their music on the South Korean version of Spotify, which launched four weeks ago.
""Unrelated to the domestic contract, which we are still negotiating, we separately received notice of the expiration of our license on February 28, and we requested a renewal of our existing global contract.
""Due to Spotify's policy that they must proceed with the domestic and global contracts at the same time, our global contract has currently expired,"" it continued. 
""We are currently continuing our negotiations about the supply of music.""
Among the artists whose discographies have at least partially disappeared are IU, Seventeen, Nu'est, Mamamoo, Epik High, Monsta X, Apink, Zico, Block B,  Lovelyz, Brave Girls, CNBlue, Younha and many others.

Battersea Power Station: Interactive image provides chimney preview,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-56538677,"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"The lift inside the north west chimney will open to the public next year
An interactive ""bubble image"" allowing people to see what London looks like from the top of Battersea Power Station, has been released.
The immersive experience, external gives users a preview of the building's chimney lift.
The glass lift is situated inside the structure's north west chimney and will take people up 358 ft (109m) when it opens as a viewing platform next year.
The Battersea Power Station Development Company said it will ""be an experience like no other"".
The main boiler house in the coal-fired station was large enough to fit St Paul's Cathedral inside
Having remained empty for decades, Battersea Power Station has been undergoing a £9bn regeneration project.
The Grade II* listed building, on the south bank of the River Thames, will contain apartments, shops, restaurants and other leisure facilities.
Technology giant Apple is also basing its new London campus across six floors of the structure.
About 30 people will be able to ride in the lift at a time
The chimney lift will be run by events firm IMG and is part of a visitor experience looking at the iconic power station's history.
The first apartment residents will move into the building this year but it will not fully open to the public until 2022.
Sam Cotton, head of leasing at Battersea Power Station Development Company, said they were ""creating a new destination in London"".
Before its redevelopment, the disused building had been empty for decades
Battersea Power Station initially only had two chimneys
Work began on the site in 1929. Initially it was proposed that the chimneys would be square not circular
The first stage of the station was completed in 1935. At the time the building only had two chimneys
The second phase was completed in 1955. When it was finished, the space inside the main boiler house was so vast it would have been possible to fit St Paul's Cathedral inside
An electrical failure at the station on 20 April 1964 caused power cuts across London including at BBC Television Centre, delaying the launch of BBC Two which had been due to go to air that night
In 1977 the structure featured on the front cover of Pink Floyd's album Animals. A giant inflatable pig was tethered between two of the chimneys, but it broke free closing the airspace to Heathrow Airport and leading to RAF jets being dispatched
Battersea Power Station was decommissioned and finally stopped generating electricity in 1983
The building was purchased by different developers in subsequent decades but lay empty until being taken over by current shareholders SP Setia, Sime Darby Property and the Employers Provident Fund
The cover for Pink Floyd's album Animals was recreated in 2011, 35 years after the record was released

Guernsey Post: Letters decline prompts freight firm purchase,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-guernsey-56503150,"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Guernsey Post chairman Simon Milsted said it was a ""significant milestone"" as ""traditional mail volumes"" declined
Guernsey Post has bought a freight firm as the Covid-19 pandemic hits its letter mail business. 
The firm said buying the Channel Islands and UK-based firm HR Air would ""strengthen and secure both businesses"".
Simon Milsted, Guernsey Post chairman, said ""traditional letter mail volumes"" had declined.
The downward trend had ""accelerated as a consequence of the global pandemic"", he said.
Guernsey Post said: ""Our parcel business has increased by about 30% over the last year, with traditional letter volumes falling by over 20%."" 
Diversifying would also offer ""many exciting opportunities"" for Guernsey Post, it said.
Air and sea freight services firm HR Air operates from Heathrow, Guernsey and Jersey.

NHS Covid-19 app update blocked for breaking Apple and Google's rules,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56713017,"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Makers of the NHS Covid-19 app had planned to ask infected users to share their check-in histories
An update to England and Wales's contact tracing app has been blocked for breaking the terms of an agreement made with Apple and Google.
The plan had been to ask users to upload logs of venue check-ins - carried out via poster barcode scans - if they tested positive for the virus. This could be used to warn others.
The update had been timed to coincide with the relaxation of lockdown rules.
But the two firms had explicitly banned such a function from the start.
Under the terms that all health authorities signed up to in order to use Apple and Google's privacy-centric contact-tracing tech, they had to agree not to collect any location data via the software. 
As a result, Apple and Google refused to make the update available for download from their app stores last week, and have instead kept the old version live.
When questioned, the Department of Health declined to discuss how this misstep had occurred.
Scotland has avoided this pitfall because it released a separate product - Check In Scotland - to share venue histories, rather than trying to build the functionality into its Protect Scotland contact-tracing app.
The Check In Scotland app was launched on 18 December
NHS Covid-19's users have long been able to scan a QR code when entering a shop, restaurant or other venue to log within the app the fact that they had visited.
But this data has never been accessible to others.
Instead, it has only come into use if local authorities have identified a location as being a virus hotspot by other means, and flagged the fact to a central database.
Since each phone regularly checks the database for a match, it can alert the owner if they need to take action as a consequence, without sharing the information with others.
However, this facility has rarely been used, in part because prior to the most recent lockdown, many local authorities were confused about what they were supposed to do.
Before shops reopened in England and Wales on Monday, along with outdoor hospitality venues in England, the intention had been to automate the process.
Pubs, restaurants and cafes with outdoor seating have been allowed to reopen
This would have involved users who had tested positive being asked if they were willing to upload their logs.
Depending on the thresholds set - for example, how many infected users registered having visited the same place on the same day - other app users would then have  been told to either monitor their symptoms or immediately get a test, whether they felt ill or not.
The Department of Health had described, external this as being a ""privacy-protecting"" approach.
But despite being opt-in, it was still a clear breach of the terms that health chiefs had agreed to when they switched to adopting Apple and Google's contact tracing API (application programming interface) in June 2020. This was after their original effort was found to miss too many potential cases of contagion.
The tech firms' Exposure Notifications System FAQ, external states that apps involved must ""not share location data from the user's device with the public health authority, Apple, or Google"".
England and Wales's QR barcode posters have been tweaked to have a simpler design
And a separate document covering the terms and conditions in more detail says that ""a contact tracing app may not use location-based APIs... and may not collect any device information to identify the precise location of users"".
Had Apple and Google made an exception for England and Wales in this case, it could have set a precedent for other countries to have sought changes of their own.
The team behind the app was told not to disclose why the update had failed to be released on schedule.
A spokeswoman for the Department of Health told the BBC: ""The deployment of the functionality of the NHS Covid-19 app to enable users to upload their venue history has been delayed.
""This does not impact the functionality of the app and we remain in discussions with our partners to provide beneficial updates to the app which protect the public.""
A spokeswoman for the Welsh government said it had nothing to add.
Apple has indicated it wants to work out a solution.
Just a week ago, the Department of Health seemed to think this update to the app would go through without problems. 
It's hard to understand why. After all, the rules for using the Apple-Google Exposure Notification System were clear -  collecting any location data was a no-no. 
The app team knew that when they switched to it last summer, having discovered that going it alone with their own system was just not practical. 
But they may have assumed that, because the sharing of locations by users was optional, the tech giants might show some flexibility. 
Instead, Apple and Google have insisted that rules are rules. 
What this underlines is that governments around the world have been forced to frame part of their response to the global pandemic according to rules set down by giant unelected corporations.  
At a time when the power of the tech giants is under the microscope as never before, that will leave many people feeling uncomfortable.

Five things to know about Apple's iOS update,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56896854,"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Apple boss Tim Cook
Apple has announced its new iOS 14.5 update for the iPhone and iPad.
The most newsy feature is its new App Tracking Transparency function - which means users will have to ""opt in"" if they want their online activity tracked by companies. Here are the things that caught our eye. 
Apple's new operating system will allow you to unlock your phone whilst wearing a mask - with a gigantic catch. 
Apple's facial recognition doesn't generally work when users are wearing a mask. Apple's work-around involves you also owning an Apple Watch. 
The Apple Watch can be used to unlock the iPhone.
Apple said: ""With Apple Watch on the wrist, unlocked, and in close proximity to iPhone, users can simply glance at their iPhone and they will receive haptic feedback from Apple Watch, indicating their iPhone has been unlocked.""
For anyone who doesn't own an Apple Watch, as well as an iPhone, this feature won't work. 
The new update will mean a prompt will flash up when you want to download an app - asking for your permission for the app to track your online activity. 
App Tracking Transparency requires permission to track
That data is currently used to create highly targeted ads based on your online behaviour by companies like Facebook.
Facebook has publically lobbied against the new change. The less Facebook knows about you, the less money it can charge for adverts. 
Apple's motives for the move have been questioned. If app developers can't make as much through advertising, they might be more inclined to charge for services - and Apple makes money from these payments. 
You can read more about this update here.
Like millions of iPhone users I downloaded iOS 14.5 last night and waited to find out what Apple's brave new world of freedom from tracking looked like. 
But nothing happened. There were no alerts from the hundreds of apps I have installed, asking me to agree to tracking. I tried downloading some new apps, but again: nothing, nada, zilch.
Buried in the privacy section of the phone's settings is a switch labelled ""Allow Apps to Request to Track"" which was toggled on. Underneath, just one app was listed - a streaming service which I think I updated last night.
It seems that even if that is switched on, tracking stays off until the apps themselves push out a request screen inviting you to accept it.
Facebook says it is in the process of pushing out its screen - preceded by another one, explaining why tracking is a good thing and has helped to keep many small businesses afloat.
But a huge system of data collection, which sees app users tracked wherever they go, has been switched off for all who download the update.
What's not clear is how much of it will be switched on again - by users, or even by the developers themselves. Many may decide that this kind of tracking has had its day, and they need to find a new model for advertising.
Apple has introduced several new emojis in its latest update.
For example, people will be able to select different skin tones for the ""couple kissing"" emoji and ""couple with heart"" emoji.
Users can pick individual skin tones in the couple kissing and couple with heart emojis
Apple said that ""Additional emoji include characters for face exhaling, face with spiral eyes, face in clouds, hearts on fire, mending heart, and woman with a beard, among others."" 
Apple is adding new emojis, including a face exhaling, woman with beard and heart on fire
Apple says Siri, its voice-controlled assistant, is becoming more diverse.
""Siri no longer has a default voice, allowing users to choose the voice that speaks to them when they first set up their device,"" says Apple. 
""In English, users can now select more diverse voice options. These new Siri voices use Neural Text to Speech technology for an incredibly natural sound,"" says Apple. 
Apple says these updates represent longstanding commitments to diversity and inclusion. 
However many of Apple's devices are made in China, where Apple has received criticism for not being more vocal about the government's treatment of Uyghurs. 
Apple's critics say that the company should be consistent in its messaging on diversity - both at home and abroad. 
Apple's new operating system will work with the newly launched ""AirTags"". 
The small disc can be attached to things like your keys or wallet. If you lose them, you'll be able to track them with the Find My app. 
Apple AirTag
This looks very similar to another product on the market: ""Tile"". 
Last week Apple was criticised during a Senate hearing for copying Tile's idea. 
Tile's General Counsel Kirsten Daru said ""We welcome competition but it has to be fair competition and Apple's idea of competing is patently unfair."" 
She also accused Apple of preventing Tile from using the technology behind Apple's Find My function, giving AirTags an unfair advantage.
Apple said the product was different. ""We didn't copy Tile's product... It's extremely different to anything else on the market,"" said Apple's Chief Compliance Officer, Kyle Andeer.

Google and Apple attacked on app store 'monopoly',https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56840379,"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Google's Sundar Pichai and Apple's Tim Cook
Senators have grilled Apple and Google in Washington over ""anti-competitive"" behaviour related to their app stores. 
Representatives from Tile, Spotify and Match also gave evidence, accusing the two tech firms of charging exorbitant fees and copying their ideas. 
Both Apple and Google's app stores charge fees of up to 30% for in-app purchases.
The two companies said the fees were justified to provide security for users.
The Senate Judiciary Committee's antitrust panel focussed on claims that Apple's App Store and Google's Google Play are anti-competitive. 
Senator Amy Klobuchar said that Apple's App Store was a ""literal monopoly"". 
She said both stores ""exclude or suppress apps that compete with their own products"" and ""charge excessive fees that affect competition in the app store economy"".
Google Play and the App Store are where the vast majority of apps worldwide are downloaded. 
Developers claim that because of a lack of competition Apple and Google can charge extortionate rates. 
There were also claims that Apple used its App Store to unfairly compete with rivals. 
Apple's new AirTag
The hearing came a day after Apple launched its new product: AirTags. These can be attached to items like car keys to help users find them. 
The product looks very similar to something already on the market - Tile. 
Tile's locator disc
Tile's General Counsel Kirsten Daru said ""We welcome competition but it has to be fair competition and Apple's idea of competing is patently unfair."" 
She also accused Apple of preventing Tile from using the technology behind Apple's Find My function, giving AirTags an unfair advantage.
Apple said the product was different. ""We didn't copy Tile's product... It's extremely different to anything else on the market,"" said Apple's Chief Compliance Officer, Kyle Andeer. 
Spotify also accused Apple of using its App Store to charge unfair rates - something Spotify's Head of Global Affairs, Horacio Gutierrez, described as an ""Apple Tax"".
He also said that Apple directly competed with Spotify with Apple Music, and the in-app charges had made Spotify less competitive. 
""They are undercutting us on price,"" he said. 
He also criticised Apple for having rules that meant they were unable to tell customers that the service was cheaper if it was bought away from the App Store. 
Apple said that Spotify had ""been incredibly aggressive when it comes to dealing with artists and creators, and driving a hard bargain"". 
Mr Andeer said that ""less than 1% of Spotify users pay a commission to Apple"".
Match, which owns Tinder, also criticised Apple and Google for the charges it had to pay. 
""It is iron-fisted monopoly control,"" said Match General Counsel Jared Sine. 
""When an industry player has the power to dictate how apps operate, how much they will be forced to pay, and in many cases, if they will even survive, it is a monopoly.""
Both Apple and Google rejected the idea that their app stores were monopolies - and said the charges were fair. 
On 3 May, Apple and Epic Games, maker of the popular game Fortnite, will begin a court case in their dispute over the App Store charges.

Taiwan authorities look into Apple supplier hack,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56846361,"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Authorities in Taiwan say they are looking into a ransomware cyber-attack on a major technology firm there.
Quanta Computer is a manufacturer of many flagship Apple products, including its MacBook line.
The hackers, known as Revil, have published stolen blueprints for unreleased products, and are threatening to release more.
Taiwanese officials said they are ""taking an initial step to look into and understand"" the incident.
It is being handled by the Ministry of Justice's investigation bureau.
On their darknet website, the anonymous hackers are attempting to extort a ransom from Apple directly, writing: ""We recommended that Apple buy back available data by 1 May.""
It is understood they are asking for tens of millions of pounds.
How close the alleged blueprints will be to any actual future products is not clear. Bloomberg reports, external that the leaked materials include the schematics for a future MacBook laptop. The Guardian reports, external that a new Apple Watch is also among them.

Apple has not responded, but Quanta confirmed a cyber-attack had taken place.
In a press release, the company said: ""Quanta Computer's information security team has worked with external IT experts in response to cyber-attacks on a small number of Quanta servers.
""We've reported to, and kept seamless communications with, the relevant law enforcement and data protection authorities concerning recent abnormal activities observed. There's no material impact on the company's business operation.""
The release of the hacked material came just hours before Apple's major product showcase event on Tuesday. 
Revil said the timing was not a coincidence, writing that the data leak was ""in order not to wait for the upcoming Apple presentations"".
The Taiwanese Investigation Bureau, under the Ministry of Justice, told Nikkei Asia: ""We are aware of an alleged cyber-attack involving Quanta and we are taking an initial step to look into and understand the nature of the incident.
""But we have not yet opened a case and launched an official probe.""
The Revil group - also known as Sodinokobi - is one of the most prolific and profitable cyber-criminal cartels in the world.
The gang has previously hacked and extorted foreign exchange company Travelex, and New York law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks.

"Apple event: AirTag, iPad and iMac lead line-up",https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56818436,"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Apple boss Tim Cook hosted the pre-recorded video at the tech giant's Cupertino headquarters
Apple has shown off its latest product line-up in its first big event of 2021.
The firm is increasing the number of products which will contain its own in-house developed M1 chip, as the sector struggles with a global semiconductor shortage.
It finally unveiled its much-anticipated tracker tile, the AirTag, which will launch at the end of April.
And it announced its first significant update to the iconic iMac desktop computer in recent years. 
It also showcased a new iPad Pro, complete with M1 chip and 5G connectivity.
What was not discussed, but was later shared by Apple, was the roll-out of the latest version of its operating system, iOS 14.5, which will include a controversial update limiting what app owners can see about user activity outside of their own apps without permission.
It's a popular business model for ""free"" internet services, including Facebook, which use the data they gather on their members' online habits to target advertising.
AirTags have been highly-anticipated by Apple fans. They are small round disks which can be attached to anything, and transmit a Bluetooth signal to a home gadget - an iPad or iPhone - to alert the user to their location. 
The original Tile tracker, a rival product, launched following a successful crowdfunding campaign in 2014.
AirTags will cost £29 ($29 in US) and are due to launch on April 30, said Apple engineering program manager Carolyn Wolfman-Estrada. They work with all devices containing the U1 chip, which includes the iPhone 11 (which launched in 2019) and later models.
She also said they were designed to ""track items not people"", with features such as rotating identifiers and audible alerts from unknown tags built in to protect privacy.

Colleen Novielli showed off new super-thin iMacs in seven different colours, built with Apple's new M1 chip, and a 24in, 11.3 million pixel screen, along with a revamped camera and other upgrades. One of Apple's older products, the iMac has not seen a significant revamp for years.
However, it only has a top RAM (the device's short-term memory) of 16GB, putting it on a par with the older Mac Mini.
""It is little surprise Apple has resisted updating the iMac over the last few years, given the transformational impact the M1 architecture has had on the overall design,"" commented Leo Gebbie from CCS insight.
""This is an endorsement of Apple's multi-year, multi-billion-dollar investment in creating its own silicon platforms which now power all its key devices.""
The M1 chip, an ultra-wide camera and 5G data connectivity are all coming to the new iPad Pro, said product manager Raja Bose. 
The M1 chip will make the latest version's graphics performance 1,500 times faster than the original, he said, in a presentation which focused on the iPad's graphics and gaming benefits.
The new model will also feature up to 2 terabytes of storage.
According to analysts IDC, the tablet market overall grew in 2020 for the first time in seven years, with sales driven by consumers and education providers during the global pandemic.
""Tablets emerged as a reliable alternative for consumers to meet their needs for content consumption and provide access to remote schooling during the lockdown,"" said Daniel Goncalves from IDC.
Mr Goncalves added that many households had bought extra tablets in the last 12 months, in order to keep up with their increased use.
Apple also announced a new subscription podcast platform, in keeping with its move towards streaming services, first announced in 2019.
And it showed off a new 4K Apple TV, with a re-designed Siri remote and HDR (High Dynamic Range). HDR offers a greater range of colours, making pictures more vivid and realistic. Sky launched an HDR service last year for a selection of its nature documentaries - but only to customers with specific premium subscriptions.
This launch wasn't exactly chock-a-block with surprises. 
The move to Apple's own silicon has so far been a success. 
The new M1 chip Macbooks have had rave reviews - so it was only a matter of time before Apple switched its other products over to the new design. 
The new iMacs and iPads will be the fastest and most powerful ever - though it would of course be preposterous if they weren't. 
Interestingly Apple also announced its much speculated AirTags. 
You'll be able to attach it to your keys or your dog's collar, anything. If you lose them, you'll be able to find it using your phone. 
This looks very much like a product already on the market, Tile - though AirTags appears at first view to have a different tracking system. 
This is another example in the long line of Big Tech companies borrowing/copying ideas from smaller companies, and it's these kinds of moves that many US  lawmakers don't like. 
And this launch was interesting too for what wasn't discussed. 
It was speculated that Apple might launch its new app tracking transparency feature - and we now know the latest version of its operating system, iOS 14.5, is due out next week.  
Apple wants to limit how companies follow you  on the internet on Apple devices. It says it wants to protect its customer's privacy. 
Platforms like Facebook, that relies heavily on ad revenue, is against the move. 
However this evening's event was all about the products.

Microsoft's Cortana silenced as Siri gets new voice,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56602321,"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"The voice assistant is saying goodbye to mobile users
Cortana, Microsoft's virtual assistant designed to compete with Apple's Siri and Google's Assistant, is to be retired on mobile.
Instead it will focus on offering productivity help in Windows 10, Outlook and Teams.
The hashtag #RIPCortana was being used on Twitter, as people reminisced - or in some cases pointed out how forgettable the assistant had been.
Meanwhile, Apple's Siri will no longer default to a female voice in English.
The use of a female voice for virtual assistants has long been controversial for gender-typing a helpful, virtual companion.
Cortana was unveiled in 2014 as a virtual assistant for Windows phones. It was named after the advanced artificial intelligence guide in Microsoft's then best-selling Halo game series.
Three years later, Microsoft abandoned its smartphone operating system, although Cortana remained available for iPhones and Android devices.
The death of the voice assistant on most platforms was announced last summer and in January, Microsoft ended support for Cortana integration in the Harman Kardon Invoke speaker. It offered speaker owners who used Cortana, a $50 Microsoft gift card.
Cortana failed to catch up with the popularity of Amazon Alexa and Google's Assistant
Ben Wood, chief analyst at research firm CSS Insight said: ""There was a certain inevitability to Microsoft abandoning the consumer-centric variant of Cortana. Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant are the mass market voice assistants of choice, leaving little space for rivals. 
""Even the mighty Apple has struggled to get traction with Siri despite making huge investments to drive the platform forward.
""Microsoft has made a sensible decision to double down on Cortana as a platform to aid productivity gains, closely tied to its business-centric tools and services. Increasingly Cortana will become deeply integrated into specific Microsoft platforms, rather than being a generic voice assistant designed to be all things to all people.""
Rival Apple has added two new voices to its assistant Siri, as well as eliminating the default female voice in the latest version of iOS.   
In 2019 a report by UNESCO, external suggested that using female voices by default for voice assistants ""sends a signal that women are obliging, docile and eager-to-please helpers available at the touch of a button or with a blunt voice command"".
Apple said of its decision to put the onus on users to choose the voice of its assistant: ""This is a continuation of Apple's commitment to diversity and inclusion, and products and services that are designed to better reflect the diversity of the world we live in.""
In some countries and languages, Siri already defaults to a male voice.

Elliot Page on Oprah Winfrey: Transition surgery 'life-saving',https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56952345,"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"This video can not be played
""I feel comfortable in my body for the first time.""
Elliot Page says having transition surgery has been a ""life-saving"" experience.
The Oscar-nominated star of Juno has opened up about coming out as a trans man in an interview with Oprah Winfrey.
He told Winfrey it was ""crucial and important"" to announce his transition at a time when the trans community is facing a ""horrible backlash"".
It was his first TV interview since he announced his transition in an open letter on social media in December.
The Canadian-born actor, 34, said having top surgery had allowed him to ""feel comfortable in my body for probably the first time"".
Top surgery involves the removal of the breast tissue to create a masculine chest.
Page said the surgery had given him a new energy, ""because it is such a freeing, freeing experience"". 
""Not only has it been life-changing for me, I do believe it's been life-saving and it's the case for so many people. And because there is such an attack on trans healthcare right now, when already there's such lack of access.""
The actor was referring to a swathe of laws in states across the US outlawing young transgender people from accessing certain medical treatments.
Page told Oprah Winfrey transitioning allowed him to ""feel comfortable in my body for probably the first time""
The interview, which will be released on Apple TV+ on Friday, was Page's first since he came out as transgender in December, an announcement that was hailed by Hollywood's transgender community as ""inspiring"".
The actor said making the announcement had been ""crucial and important"".
""In this time we're in right now and especially with this horrible backlash we're seeing towards trans people, particularly trans youth, it really felt imperative,"" he said.
During the interview, Page became tearful when asked what had brought him the ""most joy"" in transitioning.
Page said it was the ""little things"", such as being able to wear a T-shirt.
Biden overturns Trump transgender military ban
'I know what I've overcome to exist'
'The key moment in a trans male's life'
""It's getting out of the shower and the towel's around your waist and you're looking at yourself the mirror and you're just like, 'There I am'. And I'm not having the moment where I'm panicked,"" he said.
Page received international acclaim for starring as a pregnant teenager in the 2007 film Juno.
Other major films include Inception and the X-Men series, while the actor has more recently starred in Netflix series The Umbrella Academy.
Page came out as gay in 2014, telling an audience in Las Vegas: ""I am tired of hiding and I am tired of lying by omission.""
The actor, who was married to choreographer Emma Portner, before announcing their divorce in February, has been a prominent advocate for LGBT rights.
Page also used the interview to criticise moves by some US states banning transgender athletes from competing in girls sports teams.
""If you're not gonna allow trans kids to play sports, children will die,"" Page said. ""And it really is that simple.""
If you or someone you know has been affected by issues raised in this story, sources of support are available at the BBC Action Line.

Screen time at 'breaking point' but can tech help?,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56838118,"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Naz Beheshti, who used to be executive assistant to Steve Jobs at Apple, says people can make technology work for them
It is no secret that technology has become increasingly present in our lives, especially over the past year.
We use our devices to stay in touch with friends and family, to educate and entertain our children and, for many, to work from home.
But endless virtual interactions have resulted in so-called Zoom Fatigue, according to scientists at Stanford University., external
To prevent digital burnout, tech firms are now trying to design technological solutions to encourage productivity and creativity and to allow you to spend less time staring at a screen.
Microsoft has introduced a new tool on Outlook that encourages people to take shorter meetings with plenty of breaks. 
The settings schedule meetings five minutes after the hour - to provide a natural break between calls.
The tool was created in response to Microsoft's own research, which found that back-to-back virtual meetings can make people stressed and distracted.
Researchers conducted brain scans, external of 14 people during four half-hour back-to-back meetings - once without breaks, and once with 10-minute breaks in-between each meeting.
The analysis said no breaks led to a spike in stress levels, especially when switching between calls.
Blue colours show little or no stress, whereas red and yellow colours show higher levels of stress in the scan
""Taking a physical break from screens is also essential, as this can improve our ability to focus,"" Nick Hedderman, modern work lead at Microsoft UK, told the BBC. 
He suggests that leaders could create a ""positive remote culture"" by:
shortening meetings to between 20 and 40 minutes
conducting ""team check-ins"" that aren't related to work
scheduling voice-only walking meetings ""to change the scenery and improve physical wellbeing""
“If we are mindful of our behaviour and establish clear boundaries and schedules, we can choose to have technology work for us instead of against us,” says Naz Beheshti, former executive assistant to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs.
In her new book, Pause. Breathe. Choose: Become the CEO of Your Well-Being, she stresses the importance of being bored, a lesson she learned from Mr Jobs to encourage creativity.
“The next time you have a gap of time in your day, refrain from filling it,” her book says. “Resist picking up your phone or other electronic devices, which could temporarily entertain you with something diverting like your never-ending social media feed.”

Remote working: Seven tips for successful video meetings
There are a mounting number of scientific studies which have shown that phones and notifications have a detrimental effect on productivity and attention.
Research from the University of California Irvine, external found it took 23 minutes to return to a single task after a notification. And people managed to focus their attention on computers for an average of only 47 seconds, before turning to another screen such as a phone. 
Notifications can take time to recover from, lead to errors and can cause stress, the research suggests.
Apple and Google have both tried to empower smartphone users, with Apple’s Screen Time feature and Android’s Digital Wellbeing tool.
A user's device will brief them on how much time is spent on each app, and how many notifications they have received.
You can set daily limits and timeframes and customise notifications.
And Google is adding a new feature that will send an alert telling you to look up from your phone when walking.
Without notifications, even the presence of a phone can reduce your ability to concentrate, according to one study from the University of Chicago., external
For those without the willpower to disable notifications, there are tech hardware solutions.
The Light Phone is a simple mobile phone, which aims to eliminate distractions caused by smartphones.
It has very basic capabilities: calls, texts (and group messaging), alarm and mobile hotspot.
You can also add a calculator, simple music player and podcasting tool.
But the phone “will never have social media, internet browsing, email, news, or ads”, the company promises.
There has been a steep increase in orders of the Light Phone over the pandemic, as people struggle to switch off at home.
“The problem is still there, if anything it’s worse because we are locked down,” co-founder Kaiwei Tang explains.
Only 50% of Light Phone owners use it as their primary phone, many switch to it at the weekend, on holiday or in the evenings, when they want a break, Mr Tang adds.
The reMarkable is a digital notebook
And for drafting documents, or editing them, reMarkable offers a technology solution… to the notebook.
It looks like a tablet, but feels like writing on paper. The technology can also convert your handwriting into a text file to send over email. 
But as it is designed to “take you into production mode”, you can’t browse the internet, receive emails or even check the time on the tablet.
“It isn’t just a device, it is a counter-movement against all of that,” says chief executive Magnus Wanberg.
He says it is “hypocritical” of big tech companies to put the responsibility of limiting screen time on the users, when devices and algorithms are designed to be addictive.
“Focus is the scarcest commodity now that we have,” he adds.
There is a growing understanding of the importance of being left uninterrupted while doing focused ""deep work"", says Prof Duncan Brumby, of University College London. 
“We know that periods of focused deep work are short-lived and hard to carve out. 
“These periods should therefore be used wisely, and notifications disabled during these times.”
But although this may be more productive, such working patterns may not be suitable for everyone.
“You are at the mercy of your boss” if you don’t respond to calls or emails for long periods of time, says Bruce Daisley, former Twitter vice-president, now author writing about workplace culture.
“Pretty much the whole of modern working is suboptimal for concentration,” he adds. 
 “We're at breaking point with screen time.”

Google owner sees record profits as lockdown boom continues,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56910255,"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Google owner Alphabet saw its earnings soar in the first quarter as people stuck at home in the pandemic used more of its services.
Net profit jumped by 162% to a record $17.9bn in the three months to March as advertising revenue swelled by a third. 
It comes as the tech giant faces increased scrutiny over its power and the pandemic has people turning to the internet more than ever.
The firm credited ""elevated consumer activity online"" for its results.
""Over the last year, people have turned to Google Search and many online services to stay informed, connected and entertained,"" said Alphabet and Google chief executive Sundar Pichai.
Analysts had expected a good performance as economies around the world have continued to reopen, prompting more spending on online advertising. 
Reflecting this revenue at Google's search business jumped by 30% to $31.9bn in the quarter , while sales at YouTube leapt 49% to $6bn.

Google and Apple attacked on app store 'monopoly'
Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Alphabet had ""lapped up the rewards from the pandemic like a big cat pouncing on cream"". 
""While famous for its start-up culture and offices, this tech giant is, rather unspectacularly, an advertising business,"" she said. 
""Covid means phenomenal sums of money have shifted to online shopping, so Alphabet's impenetrable family of digital advertising businesses have seen revenue skyrocket.""
The only problem facing the tech giant is continued regulatory action over issues such as competition and privacy.
The latest dispute emerged on Monday when streaming TV technology company Roku accused Google of engaging in anticompetitive behaviour to benefit its YouTube and hardware businesses.
Meanwhile, US and European regulators continue to discuss tightening oversight of Google and other tech giants, but have yet to agree legislation.
On the back of the strong results, shares in Alphabet rose by 4.5% in after-hours trading.

Russia threatens to slow down Google over 'banned content',https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57241779,"Tue, 25 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Russia’s media watchdog has threatened to slow down the speed of Google if it fails to delete what it calls ""unlawful content.""
Roskomnadzor has given Google 24 hours to remove videos it says relate to drugs, violence and extremism.
Google - which owns YouTube - could be fined between 800,000 and 4 million roubles (£7,700 - £38,000) by the service.
The tech firm said it often requires court decisions to react to requests.
Roskomnadzor sent more than 26,000 notices to Google to delete what it called “illegal information,” the watchdog said in a statement reported by state-run news agency TASS. , external
The statement also accused Google of restricting YouTube access to Russian media outlets, including RT and Sputnik, and supporting ""illegal protest activity.""
Google said it receives requests from different government organisations across the world and the laws of each country vary.
The company often responds once a court decision has been reached. But it also said it was important to maintain YouTube as an open platform for various kinds of views.
If Google does not act, the watchdog said it could also slow down internet speeds for users in Russia trying to access Google.
The state has already used these powers in March, to restrict access to Twitter after Roskomnadzor said it failed to remove around 3,000 posts.
Internet service providers in Russia can limit or block the flow of data to websites, making connections slower when accessing certain pages.
Google is currently suing Roskomnadzor over demands that it removes content, according to court documents seen by Reuters. , external
The case involves twelve YouTube videos which include encouraging minors to join unsanctioned protests in January, in support of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
Mr Navalny has more than 6.5 million subscribers on YouTube, and regularly posts videos on the platform voicing his opposition to President Vladimir Putin and the Russian government.
A hearing has been scheduled for 14 July.

Apple puts more adverts in App Store after ad-tracking ban,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56995192,"Wed, 05 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Apple has added extra paid-for advertisements to its App Store, a week after its new operating system limited tracking for ads from other companies.
The new ad space lets app-makers advertise on the App Store search tab, rather than just in the search results.
Last week's release of iOS 14.5 placed strict limits on tracking on iPhones - including tracking for advertising.
And Facebook fiercely opposed the change, warning it would favour Apple's own advertising system. 
Apple's App Tracking Transparency feature requires apps on iPhones to ask for permission to track the user for advertising.
During a long-running row between the two, Facebook had warned Apple's ""privacy"" features would hurt advertisers - including app makers - and benefit Apple.
""Apple's policies leave very limited options for app developers to find customers through effective advertising - and, conveniently, Apple's own advertising products is one of them,"" Facebook had said, external.
Previously, Apple sold adverts to appear at the top of search results only. The new slot effectively doubles the advertising space for sale.
Enders Analysis senior media analyst Jamie MacEwan said: ""The timing makes sense.
""Apple probably anticipates increased demand for exposure on the App Store. That's because Apple's iOS privacy changes have made other options less attractive."" 
Facebook v Apple: The ad tracking row heats up
Google promises to drop personalised ad tracking
Ad campaigns on other sites had less reliable measurements of success, he said.
And app developers ran ads only if they were sure the cost of winning new customers was lower than the amount they would spend on the app.
""As its ads business grows, Apple will have to make sure its execution on consent and privacy is impeccable"" to avoid accusations of putting itself first, Mr MacEwan added.
Some reports suggest Apple's ad sales, external could be worth more than $2bn and are growing.
Apple has not responded to a request for comment on the timing of the new advertising product launch.
The new feature also comes as internal Apple emails reveal a tension in the company over its advertising business.
The emails, between Apple employees in 2015, discussed the possibility of adding adverts to the App Store, after Google launched them for its own Android store.
The documents emerged as part of Apple's continuing legal battle with Epic Games and were first reported on by Apple news site 9to5Mac, external.
The Epic v Apple case has made public large numbers of internal company documents
Apple anti-fraud unit head Eric Friedman was discussing the idea of ads with engineer David Neumann, the documents reveal, and how they could work better for app discovery than a ""top apps"" chart.
""The dev[eloper]s would love it,"" Mr Friedman wrote. 
""The problem is that [Apple chief executive Tim Cook] is telling the world that we make great products without monetising users. 
""Ads would be weirdly at odds with that.""
Mr Cook has long criticised big technology companies for monetising users' data, whereas Apple makes most of its money through selling high-end devices.
Apple ended up introducing its first App Store ads in mid-2016, more than a year after those emails.
But the number of ads it displays remains low compared with rival Google Play, or most social networks.

Apple Powerbeats 2 headphone customers receive payout,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57172406,"Wed, 19 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Apple is paying up to $189 (£133) in compensation to customers of Apple Powerbeats 2 headphones in the US.
In 2017, a class action lawsuit claimed the headphones did not retain battery life and were not sweat or water-resistant.
The firm paid $9.75m (£6.9m) to settle, but denied all allegations and said it wanted to avoid expensive legal fees.
Anyone who bought Powerbeats 2 earbuds before August 2020 was eligible to receive a payout.
Customers told the MacRumours news site, external they had now started to receive individual payments from the settlement.
Those users and others on social media reported receiving between $57 and $114, but the court documents, external say a maximum of $189 could be paid out, with proof of purchase. 
But some US customers said they had missed the November 2020 deadline to apply for compensation, and complained their headphones still didn't work.
Apple has been contacted by the BBC for comment.
Class action lawsuits - where a legal case against a business is brought on behalf of a group of people - are commonplace in the US.
However, these are rarer in the UK.
But there are are currently several high-profile cases against Google, Facebook and TikTok open, on behalf of millions of users of the technology platforms.
""The large amount of the settlement payout by Apply is likely to be reflective of the number of members of the class action,"" said Jowanna Conboye, technology and intellectual property partner at law firm Spencer West. 
""As the settlement agreement held anyone who bought the headphones during the relevant period is eligible for the payout this could be in the hundreds of thousands considering the popularity of Powerbeats 2 in the active earphone market.
""Tactically Apple probably did the right thing in settling the case since it gets much less negative publicity that way and any issues with its product design or manufacture that would form part of the evidence before court remains secret and protected for Apple.""

Epic v Apple: What have we learned?,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57232824,"Mon, 24 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"The much-hyped Epic v Apple trial is due to finish on Monday in California. 
Epic Games is suing Apple over the way it runs its App Store. It says the store is a monopoly and charges exorbitant fees on games like Epic's popular Fortnite.
Apple makes Epic pay a 30% commission on in-app payments. 
The judge may take weeks, if not months, to make a ruling. But during the three-week trial we've seen some interesting revelations. 
Epic wanted to broaden its lawsuit out to all apps on the App Store. Apple wished to narrow the scope to just the makers of games. Hence a lengthy argument as to whether Fortnite is an actual game and, as news site The Verge, external reported, it's actually quite hard to define.
Fortnite may look very much like a game, however, Epic believes it's more than that. Its vice-president of marketing, Matthew Weissinger, said during the trial it was in fact a ""metaverse"". 
""It's one of the remarkable things about Fortnite, we're building this thing called the metaverse, a social place,"" he said. 
This sounds like Epic dancing on the head of a pin. However, other ""games"" like Roblox describe themselves as less of a game, but more of a platform where people live in a virtual world. 
Apple chief executive Tim Cook gave evidence on Friday for the first time at the trial. He was polite and put his arguments forward in a measured way. 
However, during his cross-examination he was asked several questions about Apple's business that he said he could not answer. 
Apple's chief executive Tim Cook
For example, he was asked how profitable the App Store was and said he wasn't sure. 
We know that Google pays Apple about $10bn (£7bn) to have Google search preloaded on iPhones. However, when asked about it Mr Cook once again seemed sketchy on detail. 
News site TechCrunch, external called his performance ""mild, carefully tended ignorance"".

Epic Games v Apple: What is going on?
Interesting details about the inner workings of Epic were laid out at the trial.
The Washington Post, external reported that between January 2017 and October 2020, Epic paid $237m in commissions to Apple for Fortnite. 
However, that is less than the annual amounts it paid to other gaming platforms. For example, in 2020 it paid $245m to Microsoft and $451m to Sony. 
Epic's argument here is that Sony and Microsoft sell their consoles at a loss, so need to charge developers. Conversely iPhones bring in big profits for Apple. 
A curious quirk you may have noticed on the App Store is that if you type a certain app into search, you may well be offered up another app as the first hit. 
This is a little bit like Google search, where paid for ads are placed at the top of the search - even if they are not the most relevant hits. 
Apple does this on the App Store and it makes Epic's chief executive Tim Sweeney extremely cross. 
In an email to Apple in 2018 , he said he found it ""super-frustrating that Fortnite is not the first search result when customers search for the text 'Fortnite'"".

Other companies too have complained that this practice hurts smaller companies which can't pay for promotion.
Mr Cook was tight-lipped on the App Store's profit margins. However, when asked by the judge he confirmed that ""the majority of the revenue on the App Store comes from games"". 
Judge Rogers replied: ""And in-app purchases in particular, right?""
""Correct."" Mr Cook said. 
What came next from the judge will worry Apple.
""But you could also monetise it a different way, couldn't you? I mean, that is, the gaming industry seems to be generating a disproportionate amount of money relative to the IP that you are giving them and everybody else. In a sense, it's almost as if they're subsidising everybody else,"" the judge said. 
It's likely we won't get a ruling until later this summer. Who will win? Well, anti-trust trials are notoriously hard to to predict. However, most analysts believe this is Apple's to lose. 
But even if Epic doesn't win, the company has done a good job at publicising what it claims are unfair business practices from Apple - issues that won't go away even if Apple is victorious.

Apple faces Epic Games in court,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56959938,"Sun, 02 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"This video can not be played
Epic Games v Apple: What is going on?
After months of hype and warring words, Epic Games is finally getting its day in court with Apple.
The trial began on Monday - and is one of the most important in Apple's history. 
Apple boss Tim Cook will be giving evidence, the first time he's given testimony at a trial. 
At stake is the future of the App Store and the amount it charges developers - a wildly lucrative money spinner for the company. 
The trial got off to a slightly chaotic start. The public hearing failed at first to mute those who were listening in via phone call, meaning calls from fans for the return of Fortnite to mobiles were accidentally broadcast.
The storm began in August last year, when Epic Games laid a trap for Apple. 
Its hit game Fortnite implemented its own in-app payment - bypassing Apple's 30% charges. 
Apple promptly kicked Epic Games off the App Store.
But Epic Games was waiting for just that.
It slapped Apple with a 65-page lawsuit - and had even prepared a high production video, a spoof of Apple's iconic 1984 advert for the Apple Mac.

Epic Games has for years claimed the charges imposed on it by Apple are extortionate. 
Their argument is simple: that Apple's control over the App Store is anti-competitive. 
It believes that developers should be able to make apps for smartphones without having to pay large sums to Apple (and to Google for Google Play purchases). 
Spotify, Match and Tile are just a few of the many companies that have also claimed Apple's charges are unfair. 
Apple is estimated, external to have made hundreds of millions of dollars from Fortnite alone in charges. 
Epic Games' big argument is: if they don't want to pay, then where else do they go to sell their products? 
Fortnite's new payment option led to the game being kicked off the App Store
Apple's App Store and Google's Google Play are the dominant global app stores, outside China. 
Epic Games has tried to sell Fortnite away from these two stores. It tried to ""sideload"" the app on Android phones - to try and avoid Google's own 30% charge. However, not enough people downloaded it away from Google Play. 
Epic Games' reluctant conclusion: if you want to make games for smartphones you have to be on either the App Store or Google Play. 
But unwilling to lie down and accept the charges - which it calls an ""Apple Tax"" - Epic Games decided to sue Apple instead. 
Worryingly for Apple, many of its App Store critics come from across the political divide.
In a Senate hearing two weeks ago, Apple's Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer was grilled by lawmakers. Politicians of all stripes - usually so divided on policy - were united in their attacks on Apple. 
Democrats Amy Klobuchar and Richard Blumenthal and Republicans Mike Lee and Josh Hawley all took up similar lines of questioning. 
Senator Klobuchar said that Apple's App Store was a ""literal monopoly"".
Characters from Fortnite
And on Friday the European Union announced that it was charging Apple for its behaviour on the App Store. 
Epic Games has timed the lawsuit perfectly.  
The key question the judge will have to answer is whether Apple's App Store is an ""essential facility"", a sort of public utility that no one company should control. 
Matt Stoller, an anti-monopoly campaigner, believes so.
""Everybody knows that Apple is in charge of what should be public rights of way. It would be easiest if the judge just rules in favour of Epic [Games], that would fix it,"" he says. 
Apple can afford good lawyers though. So what's Apple's defence? 
Firstly, Apple says it invented the App Store and as a private company it can charge what it wants. 
It also says the 30% charge to developers is the industry standard for gaming, and competes not just with Google Play but with Microsoft, Steam, PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo.
Influential tech blogger John Gruber says Apple has a point. 
""In terms of the actual split, 70/30 is pretty standard across the board. One of the things that really stands out about Epic Games' argument is that they have no complaint whatsoever. It's all very hand wavy, and very much a PR argument, not a legal one.""
Apple also says that its payment system is fair to smaller developers. It says 83% of apps and 76% of games on the App Store are free - developers pay no commission. 
And they say that although their top rate charge is 30%, most developers pay no more than 15% in charges. 
Apple argues it also oversees an App Store vetting process, making sure the Apple ecosystem isn't compromised by dodgy apps. That costs money. 
However it's thought the amount that Apple spends on this process is a tiny fraction of the amount it receives from developers. Critics like Matt Stoller also question how effective Apple's vetting procedures are.
""There are all sorts of apps that have scams that Apple doesn't catch. So their arguments about safety and security are sort of nonsense,"" he says. 
So what are Apple's chances? John Gruber thinks they're good. 
""I do think that on legal grounds, Apple is in a very good position. But the risk is very high because [if they lost] it would disrupt the whole business model of the app store"". 
Matt Stoller says that antitrust cases are notoriously hard to predict.
""Antitrust law, as it's practiced in the US, is a complete mess. So we have no idea. The law basically depends on what the judge had for breakfast.""
The trial is expected to conclude in the last week of May. However, even if Apple wins, the fight over how Apple runs its App Store will rage on.

Apple v Epic: Tim Cook appears on the stand in Epic legal row,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57199547,"Fri, 21 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Epic makes Fortnite and its colourful characters - but is at odds with Apple boss Tim Cook
Apple boss Tim Cook took the witness stand for the first time in his company's major legal battle with Epic Games over an alleged monopoly. 
Epic, maker of the hit video game Fortnite, claims Apple's tight control over iPhone apps hurts competition. 
During his appearance, Mr Cook argued that keeping control of the App Store helped keep iPhones secure.
He also said he did not know if the App Store made a profit, telling the court Apple did not break down the figures.
Facing questions about the level of profit the App Store generates from the 30% commission it takes on sales, he said: ""We don't have a separate profit and loss statement for the App Store.""
Instead, he said that he had a ""feeling"" that it was profitable - but could not share figures with the court. 
Mr Cook was being questioned about his oversight of top-level decisions around the App Store's policies.
Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers also questioned Mr Cook, asking about a survey that showed 39% of developers are dissatisfied with the app store.

Mr Cook said he was not familiar with the survey but said there was a ""friction"" because Apple rejected 40% of apps weekly.
The judge also asked him if he was a gamer, to which he admitted that he was not. 
Mr Cook's opposite number in the case - Epic Games chief Tim Sweeney - has already appeared on the stand in the opening days of the long-running legal battle. 
Two main things are at the centre of the case: the 30% commission Apple takes on in-app purchases, and the fact that no other app stores are allowed to exist on the iPhone and iPad to offer an alternative. 
Epic's Fortnite is one of the most popular games in the world and makes its money through in-game purchases of character costumes and other digital items.  
A 30% cut on millions of such purchases adds up to a lot - but Apple's rules forbid the company from circumventing its payment methods if a sale is made in the iPhone app.

Epic Games v Apple: What is going on?
In August last year, Fortnite offered players a 20% discount if they paid Epic Games directly, in direct violation of Apple's rules. 
Apple quickly removed the app from its store - as did Google, which enforces a similar policy.
Epic had clearly expected that to happen. The firm immediately launched a PR blitz to mobilise its fanbase and win support, painting Apple as a dominating force suppressing freedom of choice. 
Within hours, Epic lodged prepared legal complaints in the US against both Apple and Google. 
But the debate goes beyond the 30% cut, to wider questions about competitiveness. Epic has made no secret of the fact that it would like to run its own app stores on both iOS and Android, avoiding Apple's and Google's payment and delivery systems entirely. 
This was Tim Cook's first time giving evidence at trial. 
There's no video footage of the court case but journalists can listen in to a terrible audio line that sounds like the trial is taking place under water. It's therefore hard to get a feel for the atmosphere of court. 
Still, it's pretty clear that Mr Cook is having a tough day. 
I'm used to hearing him asked questions in Congress. Usually he has a relaxed air - it takes a lot to get him flustered. 
However a cross examination in court is a very different beast. 
Grilled by an expert legal team, Mr Cook appeared more evasive. 
He was asked, for example, how much profit Apple makes from its App Store. He replied that he didn't know. Considering the App Store is a massive money spinner for Apple, that is a surprise. 
Google also pays a huge amount to Apple to have its search preloaded onto iPhones. Asked about this deal (believed to be worth around $10bn, or £7bn) Mr Cook didn't seem to know much about it, unable - or unwilling - to confirm how much this contract was worth. 
Mr Cook may be reluctant to unveil commercially sensitive data. However, he came across as vague on detail. And that's not a good look when you're giving evidence in court. 
Most experts believe this is Apple's to lose but anti-trust cases are notoriously difficult to predict.
And we're unlikely to get a judgement soon - there is a lot of evidence the judge has to wade through.
The legal cases against Apple and Google are separate, and Apple has been the first in court.
Apple is accused of running a monopoly, subjecting all apps to a cumbersome review process, and rejecting them for all sorts of reasons. Epic contends that is unfair, while Apple says it protects customers from dodgy apps. 
Much of the early debate has been over definitions, with Epic arguing that Fortnite is more than a game, but rather a ""metaverse"" within which all sorts of experiences - including concerts and film screenings - are held. 
But outside of the wrangling over technical definitions, there have also been some significant revelations.
The fact that Epic's model for its app store is not yet profitable is one of Apple's arguments against allowing an open system. 
Documents have revealed, external that Epic has made heavy losses with game giveaways, which cost it millions of dollars. However, in return it has gained millions of new users for its PC gaming platform - the Epic Games store - which Epic says was always its strategy. 
It has also emerged that Apple has debated lowering the 30% cut it takes in response to competition, with App Store chief Phil Schiller writing to Steve Jobs as long ago as 2011, external. 
And one particularly memorable exchange was born out of a debate over adult content. 
Apple had highlighted that Epic's store hosted a store-within-a-store - Itch.io - which sells adult content. Apple gave this as an example of why it did not want third-party stores on its platforms. 
An actor dressed as Fortnite's Peely the banana character
Later, while showing images of Fortnite, Apple's legal team referred to Peely, a Fortnite character who is a banana, external.
It showed him in a tuxedo, remarking: ""We thought it better to go with the suit than the naked banana, since we are in federal court this morning."" 
On cross-examination, Epic's attorney wanted to put to bed the ""implication"" that a naked banana might be inappropriate, resulting in Epic's marketing boss informing the court: ""It's just a banana, ma'am.""

Apple criticised for storing data inside China,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57186275,"Thu, 20 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Apple has confirmed that it is storing Chinese customers' data inside data centres based in China, following reports by the New York Times.
However it said it had ""never compromised the security"" of either its customers or their data.
Apple said it was complying with Chinese law about the data storage of its nationals.
However, one expert told the BBC it was effectively ""handing over the keys"" to the Chinese government by doing this.
China has long been accused of using technology to track its citizens and for the purpose of mass surveillance.
""I would have been uncomfortable a long time ago [using Apple products] if I were critical of the Chinese government,"" said Prof Michael Posner, a former Obama administration official, and director of the Centre for Business and Human Rights at New York University.
""I would have no confidence that there is any privacy in anything that I'm putting up on the cloud using an Apple product.""
By housing the encrypted data in servers inside the country, Apple was ""playing by Chinese rules"", he added.
Apple said it complied with the laws of all the countries in which it has a presence.
""We retain control of the encryption keys for our users' data, and every new data centre we build affords us the opportunity to use Apple's most cutting-edge hardware and security technologies to protect those keys,"" it said in a statement.
""In addition, we handle law enforcement requests in China through the appropriate legal process, just like we do everywhere else, and we regularly and transparently report the instances when we are compelled to provide user information.""
In December 2020 Apple removed around 46,000 apps from its China App Store, following a deadline set by the state.
The majority were games, which require an official licence to be available in the country.
And in 2019 Google abandoned a project to launch a censored version of its search engine in China, following criticism from its own staff.

Meghan Markle wears T-shirt made by Welsh designer,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-57176697,"Wed, 19 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"The Duchess of Sussex is seen wearing the ""Raising the Future"" T-shirt in a trailer for an Apple TV documentary
The Welsh designer of a slogan T-shirt worn by Meghan Markle says the orders coming in as a result will ""keep her going for weeks"".
Carrie-Anne Roberts said it was ""lovely"" to see the Duchess of Sussex wearing her ""Raising the Future"" design in a trailer for an Apple TV film.
The Me You Can't See is a documentary about mental health created by Prince Harry and Oprah Winfrey.
Ms Roberts, 31, originally from Flintshire, now lives in Margate, Kent.
The T-shirt is part of the collection from her online brand Mere Soeur, which sells clothes for women and children.
Ms Roberts said she was just getting ready for the school run to collect her six-year-old son when her phone started ringing.
""People had seen it and they wanted to tell me about it,"" she said.
""I just thought, 'I am going to have to clear my entire day now'. I knew it was going to get busy.""
Carrie-Anne Roberts says it has been her ""busiest week ever""
Since then, Ms Roberts said she has not stopped and orders have been coming in from as far away as Australia and Hong Kong, as well as the UK.
""The business is just me. I do everything, down to the packing and mailing,"" she said. 
""I think it's nice for a small business for the person running it to do that.""

How Meghan came to get hold of the garment, Ms Roberts said she does not know.

But she suspects the duchess must be aware of the brand after one of Mere Soeur's baby grows with ""The Future"" printed on it was sent to Meghan and Harry in a hamper after the birth of their son Archie.
She was later photographed handing over the item as part of a bundle of her son's old clothes when she was visiting a charity that supports mothers with HIV in South Africa.
Ms Roberts said she was delighted Meghan is displaying her slogan.
""It's a simple but strong statement,"" she explained.
""It's about how everyone brings up children in a different way, but we all have a common purpose. There are no rights or wrongs.""
Ms Roberts worked 12-hour days a garlic bread factory in Crewe before starting her own business
Ms Roberts started her business ""without even realising it"" when she became pregnant with her son and had moved back to her mother's house in Leeswood, near Mold, after a few years of working 12-hour shifts at a garlic bread factory in Crewe.  
She became a single mum and after briefly working at a cosmetics shop in Chester, she started building her brand through social media.
""My Nanna took the first pictures of the products, tote bags, in a field next to the house,"" she said.
""People bought the products, and I used that money to buy more.""

Chernobyl alcohol drink seized by authorities,https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-57011695,"Sat, 08 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"An area of 4,000 square kilometres around the nuclear power plant was abandoned after the 1986 disaster
The first bottles of an ""artisanal spirit"" made using apples grown near the Chernobyl nuclear power plant have been seized by Ukrainian authorities. 
The Chernobyl Spirit Company said 1,500 bottles of Atomik alcoholic drink were confiscated on 19 March and taken to the Kyiv Prosecutor's office. 
Officers took the shipment from a truck at a distillery in the Carpathians.
The spirit, its producers say, is Chernobyl's first consumer product since the 1986 nuclear disaster.
They are now awaiting the outcome of an investigation by the Ukrainian security services but say they have ""no idea"" why the shipment, which was destined for the UK, was seized.
""It seems that they are accusing us of using forged Ukrainian excise stamps,"" explained Prof Jim Smith, a scientist who has spent many years studying the exclusion zone before setting up the Chernobyl Spirit Company with Ukrainian colleagues. ""But this doesn't make sense since the bottles are for the UK market and are clearly labelled with valid UK excise stamps.""
Chernobyl vodka made in exclusion zone
Chernobyl: The end of a three-decade experiment
The social enterprise company that makes Atomik is run by scientists who work in the 4,000 square kilometre Chernobyl exclusion zone - an area abandoned after the catastrophic 1986 nuclear disaster. Their studies have included growing experimental crops to find out if grain, and other food grown in the zone, could be used to make products that are safe to consume.
Part of the reason for producing the spirit was to demonstrate how land around the exclusion zone could be put back to productive use. The researchers say this could allow communities there to grow and sell produce - something that is currently illegal on ""officially contaminated land"". 
When we tasted the first Atomik vodka martini in 2019, Prof Smith, who is based at Portsmouth University, explained that it was ""no more radioactive than any other vodka"". 
The team grew crops in the exclusion zone to see how much of the contamination they would take up
Prof Smith and his colleagues since adjusted their recipe to make an apple-based spirit. Those apples are grown in the Narodichi district - an area immediately outside the exclusion zone, where agriculture and development is still highly restricted. 
The company plans to use some of its profits to help communities in Ukraine - including in Narodichi - that are still affected by the economic impact of the nuclear disaster. 
BBC News contacted the Kyiv prosecutor's office for comment but, at the time of writing, has not received a response. 
Narodichi is an officially contaminated town within the outer portion of the exclusion zone
Dr Gennady Laptev, one of the company's co-owners and a Chernobyl ""liquidator"" who worked there in the first weeks after the accident, said: ""We hope this issue can be resolved so that we can continue our work trying to help people affected by the devastating social and economic impacts Chernobyl had on communities.""

Lady Gaga had a 'psychotic break' after sexual assault left her pregnant,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-57199018,"Fri, 21 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Lady Gaga said she was still suffering from the effects of her assault when she won an Oscar for A Star Is Born in 2019
Lady Gaga has revealed she suffered a breakdown as a result of sexual assault that led to pregnancy.
The star was 19 when she was raped by a male music producer, who had threatened to burn her music if she did not take her clothes off.
She says her alleged rapist then ""dropped me off pregnant on a corner... because I was vomiting and sick"".
Years later, she had ""a total psychotic break"" and was in an ""ultra state of paranoia"" as a result of the trauma.
Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, was speaking on the first episode of Oprah Winfrey and Prince Harry's new Apple TV+ series, The Me You Can't See, which tackles the stigma around mental health.
She broke down in tears as she described her assault, which took place in her early days in the music industry.
""I was 19 years old, and I was working in the business, and a producer said to me, 'Take your clothes off,'"" she recalled. ""I said no and I left, and they told me they were going to burn all of my music. And they didn't stop.
""They didn't stop asking me, and I just froze and I... I don't even remember.""
Now 35, the singer said she would never name her attacker. 
""I understand this #MeToo movement, I understand that some people feel really comfortable with this, and I do not,"" she continued. ""I do not ever want to face that person again.""
Information and support: If you are in the UK and have been affected by the issues raised in this story, these organisations may be able to help.
Gaga first discussed her rape in 2014, and addressed it in songs such as Swine and 'Til It Happens To You - which soundtracked The Hunting Ground, a documentary about sexual assault on US college campuses; and was nominated for an Oscar in 2016.
She said her breakdown came years later - and was still going on when she accepted her Oscar for A Star Is Born in 2019.
It began when she was admitted to hospital for acute pain and numbness, and was surprised to be sent to see a psychiatrist.
""I [couldn't] feel my own body,"" she recalled. ""First I felt full-on pain, then I felt numb, and then I was sick for weeks after. 
""I realised that it was the same pain that I felt when the person who raped me dropped me off pregnant on a corner, at my parents' house, because I was vomiting and sick. Because I had been being abused, and I was locked away in a studio for months.""
The star added that trauma had changed her as a person, and would never leave her.

""I had a total psychotic break and, for a couple years, I was not the same girl. The way that I feel when I feel pain was how I felt after I was raped.
""I've had so many MRIs and scans where they don't find nothing. But your body remembers.""
It took her two and a half years to recover, she said, but ""getting triggered once"" is enough for her slip back into feelings of physical and emotional pain.
However, she ended on a hopeful note, saying that, after years of effort, she had ""learned all the ways to pull myself out of it. It all started to slowly change.""

Early in June, Apple CEO Tim Cook sent out a company-wide memo telling staff they would be required back in the office by early September. Workers would be expected to be present for three days a week, with two days of remote work.
Some Apple employees weren’t happy – and pushed back with their own letter. Addressed to upper management, their message expressed frustration about the new policy, saying that it had led some employees to quit. Apple’s pre-pandemic policies discouraged remote work, but post-Covid-19, employees are challenging what they called “a disconnect between how the executive team thinks about remote/location-flexible work and the lived experiences of many of Apple’s employees”. 
Apple staffers aren’t the only ones contesting plans to return to the office. Workers at Washingtonian magazine, a US-based publication, walked off the job when their chief executive Cathy Merrill wrote an op-ed that appeared to threaten employees’ job security if they refused to return to the office five days a week. Other employers still appear to be talking tough, however; last week, Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman said he’d be “very disappointed if people haven’t found their way into the office” by early September. “Then we’ll have a different kind of conversation.” 
As employers start to unveil their post-pandemic visions for work, pushback movements from employees keen to retain their work-from-home privileges are in nascent stages. But localised protests may be indicative of more widespread resistance among workers to revert to pre-pandemic patterns. Employees may well feel they've proved they can be productive at home –  and that the reasons companies say they want them back in-office don't stack up.
Establishing future working patterns that appease all sides will be a complex process. But doing so will reap dividends for companies; if they don't, and workers have better options, they might well vote with their feet.
‘Democratisation of the workplace’
Remote work has been a positive experience for many (though not all) employees. Citing data from January 2021, results from one recent US poll showed that 44% of people currently working from home want to continue working remotely because it suits them; 39% would prefer to return to the office; and 17% want to keep working remotely because of coronavirus. In general, remote workers cite not having to commute as a major perk as well as having more room to balance work, family and leisure.
Many workers will have assumed that, once introduced, work-from-home was here to stay, and some may even have relocated accordingly. That’s partly because of how quickly companies around the world had to transition – and some employers sent signals that suggested the shift could be a long-term option. (In September, for example, Tim Cook said he didn’t believe Apple would “return to the way we were, because we’ve found that there are some things that actually work really well virtually”, though he did also caveat his comments.)
“When decisions were being made, everyone was trying to figure this out, and things got said that weren’t thought through,” notes Kimberly Merriman, professor of management at the Manning School of Business at University of Massachusetts, Lowell.
Now, with the return to work more imminent, many companies are talking about a 'hybrid' future combining both remote work and office time. But some companies either want staff back full-time in the office or for larger chunks of time – and more regularly ­– than employees had hoped for or anticipated. 
It’s already clear that not all workers are happy about being summoned back to their desks. Having made the sudden and, in many cases, stressful shift to remote work at the start of the pandemic, workers feel they’ve proved that they could make a success of it – including in roles for which bosses had previously rejected any kind of flexibility. And they are suspicious of the reasons companies are giving for calling them back.

Many firms, for example, have cited company values or culture as their reason for insisting on in-office presence. In her Washington Post op-ed, Merrill suggested that remote work was easy at first because staff “could rely on office cultures – established practices, unspoken rules and shared values, established over years in large part by people interacting in person”.
Another common refrain is that remote work stymies collaboration and innovation, because the latter in particular often arises from spontaneous conversations in the office. There’s also concern that the work-from-home model does not work for junior employees, who want to learn from their colleagues.
But, junior workers aside, employees who feel they have been productive and innovative at home are questioning the mantra that engaging with ‘corporate culture’ or water-cooler chats will make them better workers. “This [emphasis on corporate culture] kept coming up in a way that didn’t ring true. It was almost like a euphemism for ‘I want you back, I don’t want you at home. I don’t trust you.’ That’s how workers are interpreting it,” says Merriman. 
Overarchingly, workers who have enjoyed more autonomy than ever before over their working lives are reluctant to trade it back in for the presenteeism and surveillance of the pre-pandemic era. “What we’ve seen is a democratisation of the workforce, in the sense that people could decide how to work and when to work,” says Stefanie Gustafsson, senior lecturer at the University of Bath School of Management.
Merriman also feels that there has been a “power dynamic shift” in the workplace that isn’t going to go away. “In this day and age, everyone wants the kind of workplace where they feel like they matter, and leaders who ask for their opinions,” she says.
Involve employees or risk losing them
The good news is that in a tight labour market, like the US, those who are unhappy with their company’s stance on flexibility have options – and leverage. “To return to growth, business leaders will need to understand what employees really want and create policies and plans that allow for more flexibility and personalisation,” according to a recent PwC white paper.
Companies that do not work to accommodate employees’ desired working patterns do so at their own peril. “As long as this is a workforce where there are options, then these organisations will lose out,” says Gustafsson. “Before the pandemic, going to the office three days a week would be a great thing. But now, people have choices: other organisations in the same space may offer very flexible, totally remote workplaces.”
Research certainly suggests that, for a number of reasons, a higher-than-usual proportion of employees are eyeing the exit at work, in what is being called the Great Resignation. How flexible companies decide to be may well feed into this; one poll indicates that 54% of surveyed employees from around the world would consider quitting their job if they are not given some form of flexibility in terms of where and when they work. Just more than 75% of this same group said they were satisfied with their jobs, indicating that even satisfied employees are willing to quit if their employers don’t embrace a degree of remote work.
Not everyone will be able to call their own shots, however. Workers in the technology sector are in high demand, which provides them with more flexible employment options from a broader array of companies, but workers in other sectors may have less leverage. Those employed in sales, human resources and administration, for example, are far less likely to have worked remotely in the first place, and therefore less likely to be afforded more opportunities to do so in the future.
Whether employees leaving in droves – or publicising their opposition to post-pandemic working practises – will influence company policies remains to be seen. Apple has yet to respond publicly to the letter from its employees. (BBC Worklife reached out to Apple, but they did not provide a comment as of press time.) But public employee pushback may well influence workers in other companies; just as executives look to each other for examples of how they should bring employees back, workers may look to high-profile pushback efforts for inspiration. It’s also clear that companies are continuing to adjust policies; Amazon and Google have both recently introduced more flexibility into their previous return-to-office stances (though there is no evidence this is in response to employee pushback). But in general, unhappy staff don’t reflect well on companies. 
“A few numbers really reach far. Companies should be concerned when any number of employees complain like that [the Apple case]. It can escalate and give an impression, even if it’s a small number of employees, that this is the tone of the organisation,” says Merriman.
Rather than handing down decisions from the top, engaging in transparency and dialogue may well serve employers better as they establish what post-pandemic work will look like. In the last 15 months, many workers have embraced flexibility and autonomy – and will be reluctant to give it up.
“[Pushback is] more a wake-up call than a death sentence for employer relationships,” says Merriman. “I’m not sure why the pandemic made [leaders] forget that you can’t be a top-down, imposing leader when workers have options.”"

Apple employees have launched a campaign to push back against Tim Cook's plans for a widespread return to the office, according to reports.
It follows an all-staff memo last week in which the Apple boss said workers should be in the office at least three days a week by September.
But staff are demanding more flexibility, according to an internal letter obtained by news site The Verge.
Apple's policy has ""already forced some of our colleagues to quit"", it said. 
""Without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our wellbeing, and being empowered to do our best work, or being a part of Apple,"" the letter said. 
""Over the last year we often felt not just unheard, but at times actively ignored,"" it also reads, accusing management of a ""disconnect"" with employees on the topic of remote or flexible working.
Is Big Tech going off remote working? 
Facebook accused of forcing staff back to offices
The Verge reported that the letter was sent out to Apple employees, external to gather signatures last week, despite a line in the letter saying it ""is not a petition, though it may resemble one"".
Mr Cook's memo to staff said that he missed ""the hum of activity"" of in-person working, and that he knew ""I'm not alone"".
The three-day per week in-office requirement applies across the board, he said - with teams that need to work in-person requiring a four or five-day week in the office.
In the rebuttal from employees obtained by The Verge, they asked for:
Apple to leave remote working decisions up to individual teams
A company-wide survey on the topic across teams and the whole company
Exit interviews to specifically ask about ""employee churn"" because of remote work
A plan to accommodate disabilities through both remote and on-site working
Information on the environmental impact of in-person on-site work compared with remote working
Google has already issued similar orders to staff, telling them to return to work three days a week by September.
But other tech giants have taken a more relaxed approach to the return to work, as pandemic restrictions ease across the world.
Facebook has announced it believes remote work is ""the future"" and that staff may continue to work from home - even though it has been criticised for ""forcing"" contractors back into offices.
And as far back as May 2020, Twitter told its staff that they can work from home ""forever"" - but with the caveat that it is only the case if the employee role can accommodate it.

Apple lists products that pose risk to pacemakers,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57605772,"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Apple has listed products it says should be kept a ""safe distance"" away from medical devices like pacemakers and implanted defibrillators.
The list includes iPhone 12 models, Apple Watch and MacBook Pro., external
Many consumer-electronic devices contain components, such as magnets, which can interfere with medical devices.
The BBC has asked for comment from Apple, which has promoted heart health as a feature of its products. 
Some Apple Watches can take an electrocardiogram test that records the timing and strength of the electrical signals that make the heart beat., external
But the current notice warns of risks from components in some products.
""Under certain conditions, magnets and electromagnetic fields might interfere with medical devices,"" Apple wrote. 
For example, it noted, ""implanted pacemakers and defibrillators might contain sensors that respond to magnets and radios when in close contact"".
Implanted defibrillators send electrical pulses to regulate abnormal heart rhythms.
The firm said the listed products should be kept more than 15cm (6in) away from medical devices, double that if they are wirelessly charging.
A number of other manufacturers, for example Samsung, external and Huawei,, external have issued similar guidance for some of their products.
The new list was published on a support page, that earlier this month, external had said,  iPhone 12 models were ""not expected to pose a greater risk of magnetic interference to medical devices"" than other iPhones.
But the website MacRumours, which first noted the list,, external highlighted research suggesting that the iPhone 12 could interfere with implanted devices.
Research published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, external found that ""Apple's iPhone 12 Pro Max MagSafe technology can cause magnet interference"",  and consequently had the potential ""to inhibit life-saving therapy"".
MagSafe enables fast wireless charging.
While researchers acknowledged the small scale of the study, lead investigator Dr Michael Wu wrote in a press release that they were surprised by the strength of the magnets in the iPhone 12, 
""In general, a magnet can change a pacemaker's timing or deactivate a defibrillator's life-saving functions, and this research indicates the urgency for everyone to be aware that electronic devices with magnets can interfere with cardiac implantable electronic devices.""
Marie Moe, a computer security consultant for Mnemonic, who has a pacemaker herself and studies their technology, told the BBC she was not worried.
""These Apple gadgets are generally not emitting large magnetic fields, unlike heavy machinery, big concert speakers or welding equipment that anyone with a pacemaker should be more concerned about getting in close proximity to,"" she said.
Ms Moe added that magnets of the strength found in the iPhone 12 could only cause the pacemaker to switch into ""a kind of safety mode where the pacing is constant"", but it would revert back once the device was removed.
Jo Whitmore, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, echoed the sentiment that patients should not worry if they kept devices at a safe distance, She said: ""It's perfectly OK to use a smartphone when you have a pacemaker, and they're designed to return to normal settings once the magnet is moved away.""
She added concerned patients should check the device instructions or talk to the manufacturer. They could also contact their doctor or pacing clinic.

Seizure of Democrats' Apple data by Trump officials to be investigated,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57441287,"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"House Democrats Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell say they had their phone records released
The US justice department will investigate attempts by officials in the Trump administration to seize the phone records of leading Democrats.
The internal probe comes after reports that the department ordered Apple to release data as part of efforts to track down who was leaking information.
Two House Intelligence Committee members said they had been told records of their iPhone calls were handed over.
An official at the Biden White House criticised the actions as ""appalling"".
Prosecutors under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued subpoenas - or orders to submit evidence - to Apple requesting data in 2017 and early 2018, according to the New York Times.
They were reportedly looking for the source of news reports about contacts between Russia and associates of Republican President Donald Trump, a matter that was then the subject of congressional investigations, including by the House Intelligence Committee.

Justice department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said his office was beginning a review of the ""use of subpoenas and other legal authorities to obtain communication records"" of members of Congress. He said the investigation could expand if ""other issues"" arise.
His announcement came after Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Judiciary Committee chairman Dick Durbin said Mr Sessions and William Barr, who was also attorney general under President Trump, must testify or face a subpoena.
Speaking to Politico, Mr Barr said that while he ran the department he was ""not aware of any congressman's records being sought in a leak case."", external The subpoenas were issued before his tenure, according to the New York Times.
Two members of Congress - Representative Adam Schiff, now the Intelligence Committee's chairman, and committee member Eric Swalwell - are known to have been targeted.
Mr Schiff said the investigation was ""just the start"", and called for a broader look at the ""abuse of power targeting Congress and the press"" by President Trump's justice department.
Although the department routinely conducts investigations into leaked information, drawing members of Congress into such an inquiry is rare, BBC North America correspondent David Willis says. 
None of the data seized tied any of the Democrats, their aides or their family members to the leaks, the New York Times said.
The department also managed to get a gag order to stop Apple from telling those involved, the paper said. That order only expired this year, and Apple reportedly told the targets last month.
Last month, multiple media outlets reported that justice department officials secretly obtained some of their journalists' phone records in 2017. The department later said that it would stop seizing reporters data during leak investigations.

Apple pays millions in iPhone-repair explicit photo case,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57399627,"Tue, 08 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Apple described the case as an ""egregious violation"" of its policies
Apple has paid a multi-million dollar settlement to a woman whose photos and videos were shared online by technicians repairing her iPhone.
Explicit images and videos were uploaded to Facebook and other places, and made to look as if they had been posted by her.
Apple was not named in the lawsuit but its involvement came to light in an unrelated case.
It has now confirmed the incident and apologised.
In a statement, Apple said: ""We take the privacy and security of our customers' data extremely seriously and have a number of protocols in place to ensure data is protected throughout the repair process.
""When we learned of this egregious violation of our policies at one of our vendors in 2016, we took immediate action and have since continued to strengthen our vendor protocols,"" it added.
The incident, first reported by the Telegraph, external, happened five years ago when a woman studying at the University of Oregon sent her iPhone for repair with Pegatron Technology Service, an Apple repair contractor.
Apple reportedly investigated and fired the two technicians involved. 
But it also reportedly demanded confidentiality and its role in the case was only identified during a legal fight between Pegatron and its insurers, over the compensation it paid to Apple.
In 2019, in a similar case an Apple Store employee allegedly texted himself an intimate photo of a woman, taken from her phone after she took the device to be repaired. Apple immediately launched an investigation and said the individual was no longer at the company.
The incident will add weight to the growing Right to Repair movement in the US, which argues that devices such as iPhones should not be locked into official repair shops. 
Some 20 states have proposed Right to Repair legislation, which would force Apple and other manufacturers to make tools and components available to third party technicians.

Apple wants its employees to return to offices by September, a company-wide memo sent to staff on Wednesday said. 
Workers must return to their desks for at least three days a week, chief executive Tim Cook wrote. Some staff members will be given the option to work the remaining two days remotely. 
Teams that require ""in-person"" work will return for four or five days. 
Apple also told staff they will be able to apply for the chance to work remotely for two weeks a year.
However, managers will need to approve remote work requests.

Mr Cook said that despite a smooth transition to remote working, it was not an adequate replacement for in-person collaboration. 
""For all that we've been able to achieve while many of us have been separated, the truth is that there has been something essential missing from this past year: each other,"" he said in the document, seen by The Verge., external
""Video conference calling has narrowed the distance between us, to be sure, but there are things it simply cannot replicate.""
He added: ""I know I'm not alone in missing the hum of activity, the energy, creativity and collaboration of our in-person meetings and the sense of community we've all built.""
Apple has gone from strength-to-strength during the pandemic with its overall revenues jumping 50% year-on-year largely because of a surge in iPhone sales.  
The company has also been more conservative regarding its working from home policy than other tech giants. 
Facebook announced last year that its employees could work from home full-time as long, as they get approval from their manager. 
Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey also made headlines when he announced a similar policy in May 2020. 
But Google recently announced a similar bid to get more people back into offices for three days a week.

Apple Daily: Hong Kong police raid sparks rush on newspapers,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57523209,"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Hong Kongers snapped up copies of Apple Daily, a day after police raided its newsroom
People in Hong Kong have queued up to buy copies of the pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily a day after its newsroom was raided by police. 
The front page carried a message of defiance, reading: ""We must press on.""
The paper typically prints about 80,000 copies but increased that to 500,000 to meet demand. Some news stands sold out. 
The raid on the newspaper came as two of its executives were charged under Hong Kong's controversial new national security law.
A total of five executives were arrested. Editor-in-chief Ryan Law and chief executive officer Cheung Kim-hung were the two charged. 
The other three, Chief Operating Officer Chow Tat-kuen, Deputy Chief Editor Chan Pui-man and Chief Executive Editor Cheung Chi-wai remain under investigation, police said.
Ms Chan was released on bail late on Friday. She told reporters outside the police station she was saddened by the charges against two of her colleagues and said she was proud of staff for publishing the newspaper earlier that day.
Mr Chow and Mr Cheung remain in police custody.

China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried?
Apple Daily, a tabloid, is known for its bold criticism of the mainland Chinese leadership. 
Its billionaire owner Jimmy Lai, a high-profile supporter of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, is already in jail on a string of controversial charges, including allegedly participating in an unauthorised assembly in 2019.
Mr Lai is one of dozens of prominent activists arrested since Beijing introduced the national security law last year.

About 500 police officers descended on the Apple Daily newsroom on Thursday, carrying away computers and hard-drives. Police also froze HK$18m ($2.3m; £1.64m) of assets owned by three companies linked to the paper. 
The paper broadcast live footage of the raid on its Facebook account. Police were seen sitting at desks accessing reporters' computers.
In a media briefing, police said that since 2019, Apple Daily had published more than 30 articles calling on countries to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and mainland China.
The push to complete Friday's edition became a news story itself, with rival media outlets looking on as editors worked. The front page headline ""we must press on"" were the words Mr Cheung told staff as he was led away in handcuffs.

In Mongkok district, Hong Kongers queued in the early hours for the first edition. ""Usually we sell around 60 copies but tonight, we just sold 1,800,"" one news stand owner told AFP news agency.
Apple Daily reported that ""some bought 10 or 100 copies at one go, external to show their support, taking the stacks of papers with them using a trolley or a car"".
Customer Steven Chow, who bought three copies, observed: ""There is no perfect media, but it [Apple Daily] is a unique voice in Hong Kong. You may not like it, but I think you need to let them have their voice and survive, it is important.""

It is unclear how long the paper can keep running after the latest asset freeze. 
The UN's chief human rights spokesperson, Rupert Colville, said on Friday that the newsroom raid sent ""a further chilling message for media freedom"".
""We call on Hong Kong authorities to respect their obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in line with the Basic Law, in particular freedom of expression,"" he said.

""I had Apple for breakfast,"" an Instagram friend of mine wrote in a post. ""Ate one early in the morning,"" wrote another. Young people here showed off their copies of the edition. News stand agents told me a lot of young people had come to buy the paper - not their usual customers.
And the older generation did it their way. A pensioner who lives in the Yuen Long district bought 10 copies from a news stand and gave them out to passers-by. ""I want to support Apple Daily, and then to support Hong Kong's press freedom,"" she told me.
Cheung Kim-hung, Apple Daily's chief executive, has told his reporters to ""press on"". But as the government freezes its bank accounts, the paper will find it hard to trade. They might eventually find it a problem just to collect money from newsagents. 
In the longer run, Apple Daily could be disbanded if it is found guilty on charges against it and its two executives under controversial new national security law.
A reporter on Thursday asked Hong Kong's secretary for security, John Lee if the government would make sure Apple Daily can no longer publish by 1 July - the anniversary of the city's handover from Britain to China.
""If the law gives us authority to do whatever things, and it's effective and legal, we would do so,"" said Mr Lee, pledging to tackle any perceived threats to national security ""with the strictest measures"".  
That is less than a fortnight away.

Apple and Google investigated by UK competition body,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57484720,"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has confirmed it is investigating Apple and Google over their dominant position in the mobile phone market.
It is ""taking a closer look"" at the ""effective duopoly"" the two firms have.
That includes the operating systems Android and iOS, both app stores, and Safari and Chrome web browsers.
Officials are examining whether the pair are ""stifling competition across a range of digital markets"".
""The CMA is concerned this could lead to reduced innovation across the sector and consumers paying higher prices for devices and apps, or for other goods and services due to higher advertising prices,"" the authority said.
Google said its Android ecosystem generates £2.8bn in revenue for UK developers, and supports 240,000 jobs. It also said it had made major changes to its terms based on discussions with regulators - such as the EU.
Apple has also been contacted for comment.
The announcement also specifically highlighted the question of whether either of the two tech giants has market power over other businesses - including the app developers which rely on their app stores.
That has been a hot-button issue for the mobile industry over the past year, particularly since Epic Games launched its high-profile legal action against both Apple and Google, alleging unfair business practices.

""Apple and Google control the major gateways through which people download apps or browse the web on their mobiles - whether they want to shop, play games, stream music or watch TV,"" said CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli.
""We're looking into whether this could be creating problems for consumers and the businesses that want to reach people through their phones.""
A Google spokeswoman said the company welcomed the CMA's ""efforts to understand"" before implementing new rules.
""Android provides people with more choice than any other mobile platform in deciding which apps they use, and enables thousands of developers and manufacturers to build successful businesses,"" she said.
Apple is already under investigation by the CMA over its App Store, and whether its demands on app developers are anti-competitive.
Google, likewise, is being investigated for its proposed new privacy system, over concerns it could affect news publishers and the wider digital advertising market.
The CMA said that while both those topics were ""within the scope"" of the new investigation, it was also ""much broader"". 
The watchdog said it was keen to hear directly from app developers about their experiences. A questionnaire it posted included questions about which app stores developers work with, and whether there are web-based alternatives that can offer the same experience.
The investigation will last no more than a year, officials said.

iOS15: Apple continues privacy war with app tracker reports,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57392458,"Mon, 07 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Sharing health data of family members is one new feature coming to Apple health
Apple device users will now be able see when individual apps request to access features such as the microphone, camera and phone gallery, plus which third parties they have connected with in the last seven days.
The new ""app privacy report"" feature was unveiled at the firm's annual developers' conference, WWDC.
Apple has prioritised privacy lately, including a war on ad-tracking.
No new hardware was announced at the event, despite earlier speculation.
The new privacy report goes further than Apple's existing ""nutrition labels"" which show users what kinds of permissions apps ask for, before they are installed.
It will allow users to dive deep into when exactly an app used the permissions it has been given - and what third-party websites it contacted or sent data to.
""Apple continues to double down on privacy,"" said Thomas Husson, analyst at Forrester.
""In this area, no doubt Apple is leading the pack and setting the tone for the rest of the industry.""
App privacy reports will show exactly what third-party domains are contacted by an app
Other privacy-focused updates included:
audio processing moving to be on-device only - so voice commands to Apple's smart assistant Siri will not be uploaded to central servers, unlike competitors such as the Amazon Echo
Apple Mail to hide the IP address of the device it is accessed on, meaning that senders of marketing emails, for example, cannot track where an email is sent and whether it is read
Apple's own web browser Safari will prevent any third parties from accessing a user's IP address to block tracking
iCloud subscribers will have the option to route Safari traffic through two internet relays, similar to a VPN, to hide your identity; and the ""hide my email"" feature, first unveiled in 2019, will be extended to hide email addresses when used to sign up to a number of online services
However a previous move by the tech giant to offer its customers a choice over whether to accept tracking for the purposes of advertising was criticised by a number of firms, including Facebook and other free-to-use services, for which ad tracking is a rich source of revenue.
The firm also showed off a raft of updates to its Facetime video calling platform, some of which appear to compete with apps such as Zoom which exploded in popularity during the pandemic.
They include a gallery mode to view multiple speakers, a portrait mode with blurred backgrounds, and the ability to schedule Facetime calls and create web links. 
The so-called SharePlay feature lets users watch movies or listen to music together over a Facetime call
This will also enable Android and Windows PC users to join calls, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said. Until now, the platform has only worked between Apple devices.
The new features form part of its latest operating system, iOS15.
""Allowing Apple owners to invite Android and PC users to FaceTime calls via a browser acknowledges the pandemic has sparked explosive growth in group video calling,"" said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. 
""Apple risked being left behind services such as Teams and Zoom - but browser-based calling won't be enough to close the gap.""
Digital keys are coming to Apple Wallet, announced the firm's Jennifer Bailey.
Car firm BMW and hotel chain Hyatt will be among the first to offer the keys - and it will also be available for homes.
The collaboration with BMW was initially announced at WWDC 2020 but has yet to actually launch.
Some US states will now accept forms of ID through the Wallet app, Apple said
In some US states, iPhone users will also be able to store their State ID and driving licences, with the Transportation Security Administration lined up to be among the first to be able to use it, said Ms Bailey.
Apple also announced Live Text, which is able to scan a user's library of photos for text that can be made searchable and copied and pasted between apps - for example, a phone number from a business card or menu. 
Some note-taking apps have used optical character recognition (OCR) for similar reasons for years, but Apple's solution is baked into the phone operating system itself.
The health app can now track walking steadiness and issue alerts if a user appears less steady, along with exercise suggestions as to how it might improve.
Apple also enabled health app data sharing with doctors, and between family members, but only with the health app user's consent. The encrypted data is not visible to the tech giant, it stressed.
Apple boss Tim Cook introduced the WWDC conference
However, there may be a cultural barrier to overcome here, said Ben Wood.
""The ability to share health data with other family members looks an interesting idea on paper, but it is hard to see that many parents would want to share updates with their children,"" he said.
There may, for example, be a number of reasons why a person's heart rate increases which are not medical emergencies.
Others, like Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies, said she could see it being taken up by families who live far away.
""My biggest worry over the pandemic was my mom and asking how she was felt like nagging her,"" she tweeted, external.

Apple Daily: Hong Kong pro-democracy paper announces closure,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-57578926,"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"The paper reported extensively on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong
Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy paper Apple Daily has announced its closure, in a blow to media freedom in the city. 
The tabloid's offices were raided last week over allegations that several reports had breached a controversial national security law. 
Police detained the chief editor and five other executives, and company-linked assets were frozen. 
The publication had become a leading critic of the Hong Kong and Chinese leadership. 
The Apple Daily management said that ""in view of staff members' safety"", it had decided ""to cease operation immediately after midnight"" - making Thursday's publication the final printed edition. 
The Hong Kong Free Press website reports that a million copies of Apple Daily will be printed on Thursday.
UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the paper's closure was a ""chilling blow to freedom of expression in Hong Kong"".

The digital version of the 26-year old paper will no longer be updated after midnight.
A separate announcement by publisher Next Digital thanked the readers for their ""loyal support"" as well as its journalists, staff and advertisers. 
The tabloid has long been a beacon of media freedom in the Chinese-speaking world, and is widely supported by political dissidents in Hong Kong. 
Chinese officials have repeatedly said media freedoms in Hong Kong are respected, but are not absolute.
Ronny Tong, a member of Hong Kong's government, accused the paper of orchestrating a political stunt in its decision to shut down.
""People around the world probably will accuse the Hong Kong government of forcing Apple Daily to close down. But the fact of the matter is, they don't need to,"" he told the BBC.
Staff waved at those who had gathered outside to bid farewell to the paper
As night fell, supporters of the paper gathered outside its office, and lit their phone flashlights as a show of solidarity. They were also heard chanting ""add oil,"" an expression that was used during the mass protests in 2019. 
Those inside, returned the gesture, waving to those below. 
The closure comes after sustained pressure on the paper from the authorities. 
Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai, who has long been a critic of the Chinese Communist Party, is already in jail on a string of charges.
Last Thursday, some 500 police officers raided the publication's newsroom, saying its reports had breached the city's new national security law, which makes undermining the government a criminal offence.

The arrests struck fear in employees at the paper and a number quit the publication soon after. 
An editorial staff member at the paper described the feeling of unease as ""having a knife over your head"". ""If you don't leave by yourself, you may be held criminally responsible,"" she told BBC Chinese. 
A current affairs reporter for Apple Daily said after last week's raid: ""I had mixed feelings. On one hand, I was angry at the ruthlessness of the regime. I was also sad that Hong Kong might not have Apple Daily but I also felt fear.""
Analysis by Yvette Tan, BBC News
It started off as a successful local tabloid, best known for its sensationalist articles and bold catchy headlines - promising sex, drugs and scandal. But over the past 26 years, it evolved into one of the city's loudest pro-democracy voices - one of few that dared to challenge China. 
Its founder Jimmy Lai was labelled by Beijing as an ""anti-China troublemaker"", the paper accused of causing chaos. Advertisers were told to stay away from Apple Daily but Lai and his team did not back down. In fact, the paper doubled down on its critical coverage., 
""They were really a strong and loud critical voice to the government,"" one professor told me. ""It's a terrible blow for press freedom in Hong Kong. I think everyone is in shock right now.""
As for what lies ahead - Hong Kong's government is set to introduce a fake news legislation - raising fears that this could be used as a new tool to stifle dissent.
Police had accused the newspaper of publishing more than 30 articles calling on countries to impose sanctions on Hong Kong and mainland China since 2019.
They also arrested the editor-in-chief and four other executives at their homes and froze HK$18m ($2.3m; £1.64m) of assets owned by three companies linked to Apple Daily - Apple Daily Limited, Apple Daily Printing Limited and AD internet Limited.
The paper then said it only had enough cash to continue normal operations for ""several weeks"".
On Wednesday, a 55-year-old man, identified as an Apple Daily columnist, was arrested on suspicion of conspiring to collude with a foreign country or foreign forces, local media reports said. 
China introduced the national security law in Hong Kong last year in response to massive pro-democracy protests that swept through the administrative region.
The law essentially reduced Hong Kong's judicial autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators and activists. It criminalises secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces with the maximum sentence life in prison.
Since the law was enacted in June, more than 100 people have been arrested under its provisions.
