            Pat Gelsinger has a massive task ahead of him when he takes over as Intel CEO next month.
    

            The semiconductor company, whose products have served as the brains of countless computers and other important technologies, has in recent years lost its position as the industry’s undisputed leader. Among the biggest challenges Intel faces: unprecedented competition from former steadfast partners, major delays in its next-generation chips, the departure of top talent and an activist shareholder banging at the door.
    

            Experts say Intel
            
                (INTC) urgently needs an infusion of fresh leadership and a bold, newstrategy. 
    

            “I’ve always sort of wanted my career to be where the center of action is at — where is the disruption and maximum innovation going on?” Gelsinger told Samsung President and Chief Strategy Officer Young Sohn in an October interview, prior to the Intel announcement. 
    

            Investors are counting on Gelsinger — Intel’s former chief technology officer and current CEO of software giant VMWare
            
                (VMW) — to bring that kind of vision back to Intel. The company’s stock jumped 11% after Intel announced his hiring last week. 
    

            But lately, Intel’s competitors have bested it on Wall Street — over the past two years, Intel’s shares have grown nearly 26%, versus the almost 169% growth in the PHLX semiconductor index
            
                (SOX). In that time, AMD
            
                (AMD) and Nvidia
            
                (NVDA) shares are up around 398% and 300%, respectively.
    

            “These are structural issues that will take many many years to fix,” said Hans Mosesmann, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. “He has a monumental challenge.”

            The share price, among other concerns, sparked activist investor Dan Loeb of Third Point to press for change at the company earlier this month.
    

            Outgoing CEO Bob Swan is handing over a company still in relatively good financial shape. When Intel reports earnings Thursday, Wall Street analysts expect it will post $75.4 billion in annual revenue for 2020, up almost 5% from the prior year. 
    

            But analysts say that may not last as Intel works to engineer a turnaround. 
    

            Investors and customers expect Gelsinger to articulate a plan to address Intel’s manufacturing issues. He’ll also have to chart a path for new areas of growth, as analysts say it’s unlikely Intel will ever regain the market dominance it once enjoyed in its core PC business. That kind of pivot may not be easy for a 52-year-old, $72 billion company in the semiconductor industry, where developing a robust tech roadmap can take years.
    

            “I think if they cannot get back on track, the competition now is much stronger than it ever has been, ever,” said Alan Priestley, vice president analyst at Gartner. “So the competition will continue to gain share at Intel’s expense.”
    

            Intel is known for manufacturing its own chips — a distinction that was seen as a competitive advantage until the company fell off its typical two-year upgrade schedule and began trailing its rivals in producing the most advanced microprocessors. 
    

            Intel in recent years struggled to move from a 14-nanometer to a 10-nanometer chip. And in July, Intel announced its 7-nanometer chips — originally expected to arrive at the end of 2021 — would also be delayed by about six months. The company last week said it has made “strong progress” on 7-nanometer technology and will provide an update during Thursday’s earnings report.  
    

            Meanwhile, rivals Taiwan Semiconductor
            
                (TSM) Manufacturing Company and Samsung
            
                (SSNLF) continue moving ahead with developing even smaller, more powerful chips.
    

            TSMC produces chips for Intel rivals, and that’s helped AMD steal share in the crucial PC and data center markets. TSMC earlier this year announced plans to build a $12 billion manufacturing facility in Arizona by 2024 to ramp up production of 5-nanometer chips. It is also in the process of developing 3-nanometer processors, executives said during its earnings call last week.

            Gelsinger will have to decide whether to outsource some advanced chip production to a competitor, likely TSMC, something Swan suggested the company might do. Analysts say it would be surprising if Intel completely spun off its foundries, as AMD did about a decade ago, but outsourcing some production could help it fill gaps in its product line as it fixes the manufacturing issues. 
    

            “They need to figure out whether they can get their technology back on track, or just give up and do what everybody else does and buy from TSMC or other foundries,” said Wayne Lam, senior director of research at CCS Insight. “How much can you fall behind before you say, ‘Okay, well, it’s not worth trying to catch up?’”
    

            Investors were hoping for an update on Intel’s plans related to potential outsourcing during the Thursday earnings, but the company may now wait to announce a strategy until Gelsinger can make the call. Whatever he decides, there is unlikely to be a quick resolution. 
    

            “Any manufacturing fixes (such as outsourcing partially to TSMC) are unlikely to produce results until late” 2022 or 2023, or to help improve margins over the next two years, Bank of America analysts wrote in a research note Tuesday. 
    

            At the same time, Intel must contend with a changing competitive landscape.
    

            In addition to the threat AMD poses to its PC business, Intel is also losing business from Apple. The iPhone maker in November released three new Macs using its own custom-designed microprocessor fabricated by TSMC. Apple says the new M1 chip will bring performance improvements compared to the Intel chips it previously used, including faster speeds and better battery life. 
    

            “Apple has done some interesting things in terms of the core design and memory architecture to drive up its performance … [made possible] by doing it itself,” Gartner’s Priestley said. “The challenge with using standard components from a vendor like Intel is you take what Intel provides, or if you want something specific, you have to wait and intercept it on its development cycles.” 
    

            Intel told CNN Business earlier this month that Apple’s decision frees it up to “figure out how we go out and compete against those [Apple] products.” Intel said it would focus on delivering the best experiences on Windows, Chrome and Linux, while it competes against Mac products.

            At a staff meeting last week, Gelsinger told Intel employees that the company has to “deliver better products” for PCs than anything “that a lifestyle company in Cupertino” makes, a likely reference to Apple, according to a report from The Oregonian.
    

            Beyond losing a customer, the technology underlying Apple’s new chips could have broader implications for Intel. While Intel’s (and AMD’s) microprocessors are based on an x86 architecture, Apple designed its new M1 chips based on a technology licensed from ARM, which Apple has been using in mobile devices for years. 
    

            While there are already some ARM-based laptops on the market, Apple’s new Macs could be a problem for Intel if they end up becoming a successful proof point for ARM-based chips in PCs.
    

            The move will likely encourage some other PC makers to explore building more ARM-based products to “deliver similar capabilities in the Windows ecosystem to that which Apple is delivering in the Mac OS ecosystem,” Priestley said. However, he added that it could take time for software developers to catch up to the switch to ARM, which could be a backstop for Intel, especially in the enterprise business. 
    

            “You must be able to offer new independent solutions to retain those customers rather than have them send their manufacturing away,” Third Point’s Loeb said of Apple
            
                (AAPL), as well as other tech giants like Google
            
                (GOOGL) and Amazon
            
                (AMZN), in his letter to Intel earlier this month. 
    

            There is also the challenge that microprocessors (CPUs), historically Intel’s strong suit, are increasingly sharing the stage with other components — such as graphics processing units designed for AI applications in data centers, which Nvidia
            
                (NVDA) has invested heavily in — in terms of their importance to computing ecosystems.
    

            “You have to fix the CPU roadmap within a world that’s making the CPU less relevant,” Rosenblatt’s Mosesmann said. “Everybody else is investing in other areas. You have to innovate in these other areas as well.”
    

            He added: “Intel is a different company going forward, and we’ll have to find out where their key competency is.”
    

            Some experts are hopeful that Gelsinger’s experience running companies reliant on Intel technology will provide important insight as to what customers want and need. 
    

            “Pat, at VMware, was a customer of Intel — he knows what businesses are looking for, he knows what applications need more processing, he knows exactly where opportunities are at [the] hardware level,” said Ambuj Kumar, CEO of cloud software firm Fortanix, a customer of Intel. “I’m hoping that he can lead Intel’s product development in that direction.”

Apple now lets you take a 'walk' with Shawn Mendes and Dolly Parton,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/tech/apple-time-to-walk/index.html,"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            It’s 27 degrees where I live just north of New York City, but I’m taking a walk up a mountain with pop star Shawn Mendes in Griffith Park in Los Angeles. Unlike me, hands in pockets, mask giving me a little extra warmth, Mendes says hello to the people he walks by, in between reflections about his life in the spotlight.
    

            “Especially over the last few weeks, I’ve been starting my day by going for a walk, clearing my mind and leaving my phone,” he says. “Sometimes I get a little woo woo and touch the plants.”
    

            Mendes says walking about 25 minutes a day serves not only as a meditation practice but a way to “let the noise fall out of my ears,” so he’s more present around the people he loves. When he recalls the pressures of being in the studio, a photo appears on my Apple Watch of Mendes holding a guitar.
    

            Mendes is keeping me company on my walk as part of Apple
            
                (AAPL)’s new Time to Walk audio program for the Apple
            
                (AAPL) Watch.The unscripted series, where celebrities like NBA player Draymond Green, actress Uzo Aduba and country star and Moderna vaccine hero Dolly Parton, features personal stories as they go for walks in their neighborhoods.
    

            New episodes of Time to Walk, which launched on Monday, will appear in the Workout app each Monday through the end of April. (The timing for potential future episodes after “this season” have not been announced.) For Apple Watch users who use a wheelchair, Time to Walk becomes Time to Push, which tracks “roll” goals instead of steps.
    

            It’s the latest move from Apple to add exclusive content to attract new users to its fitness products and compete with companies like Peloton. 


            Last month, Apple launched Fitness+, a $9.99 monthly Apple Watch subscription pservice with workout videos, such as yoga, dance and strength training, that can be accessed from an iPad, iPhone or Apple TV. User data, including calories burned and heart rate, are displayed on screen in real time. For years, Apple has been working to turn its watch into a health and wellness hub, allowing users to monitor daily vitals, but also log data for studies related to diabetes, Parkinson’s and dementia.
    

            For me, walking has always been my preferred way of moving: low-impact and free. Having some familiar voices walking at the same time feels like a personalized spin on a podcast (although Apple never uses the p-word). I can even hear Mendes taking deep breathes in just as I do.
    

            In Parton’s sessions, I hear the background noise of birds as she talks about her Tennessee farm. “During this time, Covid and all that, I know a lot of you can’t get out and walk like you do normally, and I’m sure a lot of you feel confined,” says Parton. “But I know how important it is to be able to walk. So even though we can’t get out and walk around all the places we’d like to this day and time. … I can still take you down on a walk on memory lane. Hopefully with us walking together we’ll feel a little more freedom.”
    

            She tells me she does a lot of writing while walking and the backstory of her famous “9 to 5” song; I listen intently to her tapping her own acrylic fingernails so it sounds like a typewriter for rhythm in the background, something I didn’t know until today. 
    

            When NBA player Draymond Green recalls how the Golden State Warriors celebrated a championship win, it’s “Big Rings” by Drake that takes him back to the locker room. It’s one of three songs he intros and plays on his episode, which also includes a beautiful story about a walk he took after failing a class and getting into an argument with his mother. He talks about the sounds of the Malibu waves in the distance and the cars on the highway nearby.
    

            Although Time to Walk is no substitute for a stroll with a good friend, it’s intimate storytelling is a welcomed change to walking alone.

Apple issues new warning: Keep your iPhone 6 inches away from your pacemaker,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/25/tech/iphone-12-medical-device-interference/index.html,"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            An important heads-up for iPhone owners: Apple is warning customers that its smartphones could interfere with medical devices, including pacemakers. 
    

            In a notice published on Apple’s support page Saturday, the company expanded upon previously issued safety information, warning users that iPhones contain magnets and radios that emit electromagnetic fields, both of which “may interfere” with medical devices such as implanted pacemakers and defibrillators. 
    

            The Saturday notice specifically warns users about “the magnets inside” all four iPhone 12 models, as well as MagSafe accessories. Apple
            
                (AAPL) notes that iPhone 12 versions contain more magnets than prior iPhone models, but it also said they don’t pose a greater risk of magnetic interference with medical devices than earlier models. 
    

            Apple said in the update that medical devices can contain sensors that may react to magnets or radio waves that come in close proximity. The company recommends keeping iPhones and MagSafe chargers a “safe distance” away from medical devices — which it defines as more than 6 inches apart, or 15 inches apart when wirelessly charging. 
    

            When Apple unveiled the iPhone 12 last fall, the company also announced the return of MagSafe — formerly a beloved MacBook feature — for the iPhone. Customers can buy MagSafe charging docks to wirelessly juice-up their devices, and other magnetic accessories including cases and wallets that attach to the back of the phones. 
    

            Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on why it is now expanding on the safety guidance. But the Heart Rhythm Journal released a report earlier this month claiming that the magnets in the iPhone 12 that make it compatible with MagSafe accessories could interfere with an implanted defibrillator. 
    

            Health experts have long cautioned not to use or hold cellphones too close to implanted medical devices — for example, warning people not to store them in shirt pockets.
    

            “Consult your physician and medical device manufacturer for information specific to your medical device and whether you need to maintain a safe distance of separation between your medical device and iPhone or any MagSafe accessories,” Apple said in the notice. “Manufacturers often provide recommendations on the safe use of their devices around wireless or magnetic products to prevent possible interference.”
    

            If a customer feels like their iPhone 12 or MagSafe charger is interfering with their medical device, they should stop using them, Apple said.
    

            Another thing iPhone 12 users should be aware of when using MagSafe chargers: Avoid placing credit cards, security badges, passports or key FOBs between your phone and your MagSafe charger, as the magnets might damage magnetic strips or RFID chips in these items, Apple warns. If you have a phone case that holds such items, be sure to remove them before wirelessly charging your device.

"Apple CEO Tim Cook once gave President Trump a $5,999 Mac Pro",https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/21/tech/apple-trump-mac-pro/index.html,"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Latest Market News 




            Hot Stocks 




            In a new financial document released just hours after he left the White House, former President Donald Trump disclosed Apple CEO Tim Cook once gave him a $5,999 Mac Pro computer.
    

            The documents, made public on Wednesday, list the item as “the first created at the Flex Factory in Austin, Texas.” 
    

            Apple
            
                (AAPL) did not respond to a request for comment on whether it was the first Mac Pro computer out of the factory, but the timing seems unlikely. The factory opened in 2013. It could, however, be the first 2019 model to come out of the facility.
    

            The Mac Pro gift likely stems from a November 2019 factory visit to highlight American jobs at the Flex Ltd. manufacturing facility that makes Apple products. Controversy followed the meeting, as Trump implied the factory was new for Apple under his leadership, which is was not.
    

            “We’re seeing the beginning of a very powerful and important plant,” Trump said at the time. “Anybody that followed my campaign, I would always talk about Apple, that I want to see Apple building plants in the United States. And that’s what’s happening.”
    

            It’s possible he got it confused with Apple’s new $1 billion Austin campus that it broke ground on the same day.
    

            Also listed on the disclosure is a $529 leather bomber jacket from Ford chairman Bill Ford, $650 Ultimate Championship belt from martial artist professional Colby Covington, and golf clubs and accessories from Derek Sprague, former president of the PGA of America. (The disclosure listed Sprague as president of the US Golf Association.) 
    

            The disclosure also revealed that Trump’s hotels and golf clubs took a hit last year due to the global pandemic. Trump’s businesses generated nearly 40% less revenue in 2020 and the first 20 days of this year compared to 2019.
    

            While it’s common for presidents to receive gifts, there are rules and regulations around what they can accept.
    

            While the Mac Pro is a costly gift, it’s the baseline cost of the current 2020 model. That’s before you factor in a $999 Pro stand and other bells and whistles like $5,999 for a 32-inch Pro Display XDR with Retina 6K display and $25,000 for 1.5 TB of memory. All in, a Mac Pro can cost up to $62,571.
    

            Cook and Trump had cultivated an unlikely relationship during Trump’s presidency, from dinners to appearing with Ivanka Trump to promote education. After Trump famously called Cook “Tim Apple” at a White House event, the CEO changed his name to that on Twitter.
    

            But the pair also bumped heads over the years, including when Trump injected himself into a fight between the Justice Department and Apple over the security protections on iPhones used by the gunman who killed three people on a US naval base in Pensacola, Fla. Cook has also spoken out against Trump’s immigration policies.
    

  Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the financial impact of the pandemic on Donald Trump's businesses revealed by his financial disclosure. The revenue for these businesses has fallen by nearly 40%.

"Parler has now been booted by Amazon, Apple and Google",https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/09/tech/parler-suspended-apple-app-store/index.html,"Sat, 09 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Hot Stocks 




Parler, the alternative social media platform favored by conservatives, now finds itself virtually homeless on the internet as Amazon
            
                (AMZN), Apple
            
                (AAPL) and Google
            
                (GOOGL) have all booted it from their platforms in a span of a little more than 24 hours. 
    

            Amazon said it would remove Parler from its cloud hosting service, Amazon Web Services, Sunday evening, effectively kicking it off of the public internet after mounting pressure from the public and Amazon employees. 
    

            The decision, which went into force on Sunday at 11:59 p.m. Pacific time, will shut down Parler’s website and app until it can find a new hosting provider. The Parler website was not accessible early on Monday.
    

BuzzFeed News was first to report the move. Parler is an alternative social network popular with conservatives and has been heavily used by supporters of President Donald Trump, including some who participated in Wednesday’s US Capitol unrest.
    

            In a letter obtained by CNN Business that was sent to Parler Chief Policy Officer Amy Peikoff on Saturday, Amazon Web Services said that in recent weeks it has reported 98 examples to Parler of “posts that clearly encourage and incite violence.” The letter includes screenshots of several examples.
    

            “We’ve seen a steady increase in this violent content on your website, all of which violates our terms,” AWS wrote. “It’s clear that Parler does not have an effective process to comply with the AWS terms of service.”
    

            The letter continued: “AWS provides technology and services to customers across the political spectrum, and we continue to respect Parler’s right to determine for itself what content it will allow on its site. However, we cannot provide services to a customer that is unable to effectively identify and remove content that encourages or incites violence against others. Because Parler cannot comply with our terms of service and poses a very real risk to public safety, we plan to suspend Parler’s account.” 
    

            The sweep threatens to cut Parler off from its entire audience. Not only will new users be unable to find Parler on the internet’s two largest app stores, even those who’ve already downloaded the app will be unable to use it because it will be unable to communicate with Parler’s servers on AWS.
    

            Indeed, Parler CEO John Matze warned that the deplatforming could lead to service interruptions.
    

            After Amazon boots the company from its web hosting service, Parler’s website could be offline for as long as a week while “we rebuild from scratch,” Matze said in a post on his platform.  
    

            “We will try our best to move to a new provider right now as we have many competing for our business,” Matze continued. 
    

            Matze accused Amazon of trying to “completely remove free speech off the internet.” 
    

            The revelation of Amazon’s decision came soon after Apple removed Parler from its app store. 
    

            “[T]here is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity,” the iPhone maker said of its move. 
    

            Apple notified Parler of its decision in a message that said it had violated the company’s app store terms.  
    

            “The processes Parler has put in place to moderate or prevent the spread of dangerous and illegal content have proved insufficient,” Apple told Parler. “Specifically, we have continued to find direct threats of violence and calls to incite lawless action in violation of Guideline 1.1 - Safety - Objectionable Content.”
    

            Apple’s notice said Parler’s responses to an earlier warning were inadequate, including Parler’s defense that it had been taking violent rhetoric on its platform “very seriously for weeks” and that it had a moderation plan “for the time being,” according to Apple.
    

            “Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people’s safety,” Apple said in a statement to CNN Business. “We have suspended Parler from the App Store until they resolve these issues.”
    

            Apple’s decision followed a similar move by Google on Friday to drop Parler from the Google Play Store. 
    

            Matze wrote in a message on his platform that Apple “will be banning Parler until we give up free speech, institute broad and invasive policies like Twitter and Facebook and we become a surveillance platform by pursuing guilt of those who use Parler before innocence.”
    

            “They claim it is due to violence on the platform,” Matze wrote of Apple, whom he also accused of being a “software monopoly,” a particularly relevant attack right now given an ongoing antitrust suit against Apple from Fortnite maker Epic Games. “The community disagrees as we hit number 1 on their store today.”
    

            Matze promised to share “more details about our next plans coming soon as we have many options.”

'Palmer' gives Justin Timberlake a chance to show off his dramatic side,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/entertainment/palmer-review/index.html,"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            Off-screen drama shouldn’t obscure the on-screen merits of “Palmer,” a small movie that offers a solid showcase for Justin Timberlake. Reminiscent of “Sling Blade” in its themes and tone, the Apple TV+ film hinges on the unlikely bond between a man and a young boy, offering the former redemption and the latter the supportive figure he’s lacked.
    

            Timberlake’s Eddie Palmer was a high-school football star, whose bad judgment landed him a 12-year prison sentence. Returning to his home town in Louisiana, he takes up residence with his grandma (June Squibb) and struggles to find work, finally landing a janitor’s job at the local school.
    

            The town is “still all about church and football,” he’s reminded, which makes life even harder on the aforementioned boy, Sam (wonderfully played by Ryder Allen), a victim of constant bullying because of his nonconforming gender identity. Moreover, his addict mother (Juno Temple) abandons him, leaving the taciturn Palmer as his unlikely overseer, with a little help from the kid’s caring teacher (“Raising Dion’s” Alisha Wainwright).
    

            Images of the married Timberlake holding hands with Wainwright caused a bit of a tabloid furor in 2019, which is either a promotional boon for such a modestly scaled movie, an unwelcome distraction or a little of both.
    

            Setting those extracurricular concerns aside, “Palmer” derives a quiet strength from its performances and the narrative arc of the title character, who goes from snapping, “You know you’re a boy, right?” at Sam when he plays with dolls to becoming determined to protect him, even if that means making sacrifices and potentially endangering his newly gained freedom.
    

            Timberlake has played dramatic roles before (see “The Social Network”), but this starring vehicle nevertheless feels like a step up in class and ambition, and he’s quite convincing as a guy with the hollowed-out look of someone haunted by regret, who had the future laid out for him – with a football scholarship to LSU – before derailing his life. 
    

            Directed by actor and documentarian Fisher Stevens, “Palmer” certainly doesn’t break any ground, but its simple story is sensitively told. As streaming services like Apple’s endeavor to stand out from the crowd, championing this kind of worthwhile little movie seems like as good a way as any to get some extra bang for their bucks.
    

“Palmer” premieres Jan. 29 on Apple TV+. It’s rated R.

Why messaging app Signal is surging in popularity right now,https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/12/tech/signal-growth-whatsapp-confusion/index.html,"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Users have flocked to encrypted messaging app Signal by the millions in recent days — bringing it to the No. 1 spot on both Google Play Store and Apple App Store’s top free apps lists this week. 
    

            Signal had about 7.5 million installations globally from the App Store and Google Play between Thursday and Sunday, more than 43 times the installations it received during the previous week, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. 
    

            Encrypted messaging services like Signal have gained popularity in recent years, as people are increasingly concerned with safeguarding their private information. However, this particular bump in Signal’s usership comes in the wake of confusion over an updated terms of service notification from Facebook-owned encrypted messaging service WhatsApp.
    

            Signal also received endorsements last week from several of Silicon Valley’s biggest names, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk. 
    

            The jump in new Signal downloads also followed the riots in Washington D.C. and moves by Amazon
            
                (AMZN), Apple
            
                (AAPL) and Google
            
                (GOOGL) to cut ties with Parler, the social networking service favored by members of the far-right. Telegram, another encrypted messaging app on Tuesday said it had attracted 25 million new users from around the world in the previous 72 hours, bringing its total active user base to 500 million. 
    

            The huge spike in Signal’s traffic caused some glitches. On Thursday, Signal tweeted that verification codes for new user sign-ups might be delayed “because so many new people are trying to join Signal right now (we can barely register our excitement).” The issue was resolved over the weekend.
    

            “We are currently having a record level of downloads for the Signal app around the world,” Signal staff said in a Reddit post Friday.
    

            WhatsApp began notifying users last month of its updated terms of service and privacy policy, which people must agree to in order to keep using the app beyond February 8.
    

            Many users expressed concerns about a section of WhatsApp’s privacy policy that details what user data is collected and shared with parent company Facebook, which has a troubled reputation when it comes to protecting user data. 
    

            All private messages between individuals and most businesses on WhatsApp are protected by end-to-end encryption, meaning the app can’t see them or share them with Facebook (users will be notified before chatting with a business where messages are not end-to-end encrypted). But WhatsApp does collect other user information, such has how and when someone uses the app, and user device information like IP addresses. 
    

            WhatsApp’s privacy policy states that user information it collects may be shared with other Facebook companies “to help operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services and their offerings.” 
    

            However, these data sharing practices are not new, according to the company.

Apple rolls out privacy 'nutrition labels' on apps


            Here’s what has changed: WhatsApp’s privacy was last updated globally in 2016. At the time, it offered WhatsApp users the ability to opt-out of sharing data with Facebook, an option that was available for only a short time. In this latest update, the reference to that now-expired opt-out option has been removed. 
    

            The more significant update to the policy relates to WhatsApp’s business users. It discloses that businesses thatuse WhatsApp to talk to customers can choose to store logs of their conversations on Facebook hosting services.
    

            “The update does not change WhatsApp’s data sharing practices with Facebook and does not impact how people communicate privately with friends or family wherever they are in the world,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said in a statement, adding that the company remains “deeply committed to protecting people’s privacy.”   
    

            In short: No additional WhatsApp user data will be shared with Facebook after accepting the new terms than was shared before. That is, unless you took advantage of the opt-out in 2016.
    

            WhatsApp has been trying to disspell confusion over the updated policy, including by publishing an FAQ on its privacy practices.
    

            While the policy isn’t new, the dustup has drawn attention to WhatsApp’s data sharing practices with Facebook which many people might not have read before clicking “agree.” That may be encouraging users to jump ship, with Signal proving to be the most popular alternative. 
    

            Signal is another free app that provides encrypted messaging, calling and video chat. “Encrypted” means that the contents of messages are scrambled until they reach the recipient, and no intermediary can view them. The app is run by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which launched in 2018 with the help of WhatsApp Co-Founder Brian Acton, who left WhatsApp and Facebook the prior year. 
    

            Acton said in a 2018 statement announcing the launch of the foundation that Signal aims to build “sustainable technology that respects users and does not rely on the commoditization of personal data.”

            Amid the rush of new sign-ups, Signal is rolling out new features similar to those on WhatsApp, such as wallpaper backgrounds for chats and an “about” section for user profiles. And a new Apple policy requiring that apps provide a 
            
                label detailing their privacy practices on the App Store may make it easier for users to compare various messaging apps’ policies.
    

            Signal did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the rush of new sign-ups.
    

            The app has received some high profile endorsements. Tesla
            
                (TSLA)’s Musk on January 7 tweeted: “Use Signal.” Twitter
            
                (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey retweeted it, and later posted an image of Signal at the top of the App Store chart, captioning it with a heart.
    

            Former NSA contractor Edward Snowden also retweeted Musk’s post, adding the message: “That’s @signalapp, for those who don’t speak Elon.” 
    

            Though their tweets didn’t mention Facebook or WhatsApp, both Musk and Dorsey have previously criticized the social media giant.
    

            Some people were apparently confused about Musk’s advice, though. Shares of Signal Advance
            
                (SIGL) — a small, Texas-based technology company unrelated to the messaging app — rose more than 6,000% in the days following Musk’s tweet, before tempering on Tuesday.  
    

            Signal, the messaging app, posted a cheeky tweet about the mix-up, saying: “Is this what stock analysts mean when they say that the market is giving mixed Signals?”

            Apple on Tuesday unveiled a small change to its syringe emoji that removes the drops of blood.
    

            The redesigned syringe is part of Apple’s iOS 14.5 beta, which also has a number of new emoji options, including a heart on fire, a face with swirly eyes and the ability for both women and men to have beards. 
    

            Eliminating the blood from the syringe emoji makes it more appropriate to represent Covid-19 vaccination, said Jeremy Burge, the chief emoji officer of Emojipedia, an online emoji dictionary. (He also said the change doesn’t prevent the emoji from being used to represent donating blood.) 
    

            The move to make the emoji less graphic comes amid the largest vaccine rollout in US history. 
    

            “Removing the blood makes this emoji more versatile, and also might remove any misconception that vaccination involves blood,” Burge told CNN Business.  “Whether this directly impacts how the emoji is used or if it assists vaccination rates we don’t yet know, but it shouldn’t hurt.” 
    

            Apple
            
                (AAPL) declined to provide more information on the change. 
    

            During the pandemic, popular emojis have included the microbe (🦠), one with a face mask (😷) and prayer hands (🙏). Emojipedia said it saw an “upward trend” for the syringe emoji in its analysis of 2020 emoji trends.

The man behind Fortnite is making the riskiest bet of his career. The payoff could be huge,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/10/tech/tim-sweeney-epic-games-risk-takers/index.html,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            Over the course of his career Tim Sweeney has been unafraid to take on tech industry giants.
    

            The CEO and founder of Epic Games has had a knack for picking the right battles while also shoring up his company’s independence. Fortnite, the company’s blockbuster battle royale game, recently topped more than 15 million concurrent players and has spawned a universe of fandom. Epic challengedestablished platforms by launching its own digital video game storefront. And the multi-billion dollar company developed the Unreal Engine, a proprietary software for making its own video games that it licenses out to other developers and animators.
    

            Now Sweeney, 50, is embarking on the biggest battle in his company’s 30-year history: Epic is suing Apple and Google in a legal challenge that could remake the future of the digital economy.
    

            “Epic’s frustration with Apple especially, and Google to some extent, had been building up for at least three years. Ever since Fortnite grew to have a large audience, we felt stifled by several things,” Sweeney told CNN Business during a December interview.
    

            Launched in 2017, Fortnite quickly became a phenomenon. When it first debuted, Epic charged$40 to download the game — a typical price. But the company quickly pivoted toa riskier business model, betting that offering Fortnite as a free-to-play game with in-app purchases of digital items like outfits would generate more overall revenue.
    

            The bet paid off. Though Epic has raked in billions off Fortnite’s in-game purchases — about $1.3 billion in 2020 and $1.8 billion in 2019, according to Nielsen’s gaming division SuperData — the company balked at paying a chunk of that revenue to app store owners like Apple and Google. If a player downloaded Fortnite from Apple’s App Store, for example, Apple would receive a 30% cut of all in-app purchases. 
    

            Sweeney believed that requirement violated antitrust laws because it forced developers to use Apple and Google’s payment systems. 
    

            So Epic spent months developing its battle plan to fight Apple, which it codenamed “Project Liberty,” he said.
    

            The company prepped a 60-page lawsuit and created a video that parodied Apple’s classic “1984” commercial, for good measure. 
    

            On August 13, Project Liberty was sprung into action — a plan that sought to force the tech giants into response.
    

            In a blog post, Epic encouraged Fortnite users to pay the company directly for in-app purchases. Both Google and Apple promptly removed Fortnite from their stores, alleging the company violated their terms of service. Epic then filed lawsuits against each of the companies, in which Epic argued the courts should intervene and order Apple and Google to allow developers to sell in-app purchases without the 30% revenue cut.
    

            “Epic’s problem is entirely self-inflicted and is in their power to resolve,” Apple said in a statement. “Epic has been one of the most successful developers on the App Store, growing into a multibillion dollar business that reaches millions of iOS customers around the world. We very much want to keep the company as part of the Apple Developer Program and their apps on the Store.” 
    

            Google responded that it had “consistent policies that are fair to developers” and that Fortnite had violated those rules. “However, we welcome the opportunity to continue our discussions with Epic and bring Fortnite back to Google Play,” it added.
    

            For Sweeney, who spoke to CNN Business via video call from his home, the battle against Apple and Google is about more than just a 30% cut of its revenue. 
    

            “I grew up in a time in which anybody could make software. This is my first computer, an Apple II,” said Sweeney, gesturing towards the iconic blocky, grey machine on the desk behind him. “You turn it on and it comes up with a programming language prompt,” he continued. “So I felt all along that open platforms are the key to free markets and the future of computing.”
    

            In 1991, a young, 20-something Sweeney founded Epic, then known as Potomac Computer Systems, as a way to sell copies of a video game he made himself. He ran the company out of his parents’ house in Maryland.
    

            While Epic produced its own shooter games like Fire Fight and Unreal, it also began licensing its game development technology to other game makers in the late 1990s. This became the Unreal Engine, a ubiquitous game software which is now an essential part of Epic’s business. Between 2012 and 2017, Epic survived mostly on revenue generated from the Unreal Engine’s licensing fees, said Sweeney. Today, the Unreal Engine is also usedin animation, such as creating scenes for Disney’s “The Mandalorian.”
    

            Sweeney said he always envisioned Epic as a multi-faceted business. He wanted Epic to bothmakeand sell games — and create and license the tools used to make them.
    

            One part of that equation was, of course, Fortnite.
    

            From the outset, Epic has always has always had outsized ambitions for Fortnite. The game has dozens of crossovers each year, fromMarvel’s Avengers to Star Wars. Ithostsmassive virtual concerts and gives gamers endless shiny features, with the aim that there’s something new each time a player logs on. But the breakneck speed of development allegedlyhad a real cost for its workers, some of whom told gaming publication Polygon in 2019 that they regularly worked 70-hour weeks. Since then, Epic has made changes including hiring more people, soliciting more employee feedback, offering unlimited paid time off and mandating company-wide vacations, according to the company.
    

            Epic’s decision in 2018 to expand into selling third-party games created yet another business opportunity, and yet another fight against the establishment. Bylaunching its own games store, and cutting out the middleman, Epic was attempting to break into an already thriving market for PC games that was, at the time, dominated by Steam, a popular games store. 
    

            “We had to move mountains in order to have any chance of gaining traction at all,” said Sweeney. Epic’sstore attracted attention for splashy stunts like giving away Grand Theft Auto V, which is the best-selling game in the US in the last decade, according to NPD Group.
    

            While the Epic Games Store has gained momentum, attracting over 160 million PC users and generatingover $700 million in purchases last year according to the company, critics object to its exclusive deals that keep certain games out of other stores. Sweeney has defended his position, saying the store exclusives are a reasonable strategy that helps Epic compete against Steam. 
    

            In 2019, Epic acquired social media app Houseparty and later announced it would add voice chat to Fortnite through the app. 
    

            The company was valued at $17.3 billion as of 2020, making Sweeney a billionaire.
    

            While investors of Epic include Tencent, which has a 39% stake, and Sony, which purchased a 1.4% stake in 2020 for $250 million, Sweeney remains the CEO and controlling shareholder. 
    

            Competitor Roblox has announced its plans for a direct listingand Unity — a rival to Unreal — went public in 2020. But Epic Games has little interest in an IPO.
    

            “We’re still a highly independent company who’s not beholden to public markets in which we have to show ever-increasing profits,” said Sweeney. “And anything like a fight like this [with Apple and Google], which loses us money for a year or more, would never be tolerated. So we have the financial independence to do that.”
    

            Epic’s business model gives it a flexibility that other tech companies don’t necessarily have.
    

            “Unlike Facebook, iOS doesn’t drive the majority of Epic’s revenues. Unlike Spotify or Netflix, Epic is highly profitable,” said Matthew Ball, a former Amazon Studios executive and strategist who has penned over 20,000 words on Fortnite and Epic. “And unlike almost all other large companies, Epic is private and majority controlled by one person.”
    

            Ball added that the fight with Apple and Google didn’t come without sacrifices for Epic, which might see avid iPhone users find other games to replace Fortnite as the app spends months if not years in legal purgatory. “But Epic is uniquely able to push back,” he said.
    

            Sweeney declined to say how much the company is spending on legal fees, but he said that the fight to take on Apple and Google is costing “lots and lots” of senior leadership time. 
    

            And the ban on Fortnite in app stores is costing the company plenty in lost revenue. Fortnite users have spent about $1.2 billion globally on the game on iOS since its launch, according to mobile app tracker Sensor Tower.
    

            Epic’s case against Apple is expected to go to trial in May. Google is seeking to have Epic’s suit dismissed in a hearing scheduled on February 18.
    

            Such a public fray has unnerved some developers, who fear that Apple might go a step further and remove apps from its store simply for being built using the Unreal Engine, which it briefly threatened to do last August.
    

            “We were legitimately planning to switch to Unreal for our next VR project but after Tim decided to poke the bear we decided it wasn’t [worth] the risk,” game developer Ryan Engle tweeted in December. “I love Epic and Unreal, but business is business and the real-world consequences of Apple banning Epic is too much risk for us.”
    

            Sweeney responded saying that Engle’s “fear of retaliation by Apple” was shared by many developers, but Epic would “fight on just the same!”
    

            Epic is also risking Fortnite’s market share on iOS and Android platforms, as fans may turn to other games during the legal battle. On Android devices, Fortnite can be downloaded from Epic’s website and app stores other than Google’s Play Store, so while access is hindered, it’s not eliminated. However on Apple devices, the game can no longer be downloaded at all.
    

            Sweeney also faced backlash in November for controversially comparingFortnite’s legal battle to the civil rights movement.
    

            “The point is if you really want to make a difference, you have to buck the system,” Sweeney said in response to the criticism. “I think there’s a lot we can learn from any of the past struggles in humanity and I think it’s perfectly healthy to apply struggles from vital causes in the history of the world to struggles over smaller issues like software platforms.”
    

            For Epic Games and Sweeney, the risks are worthwhile. Sweeney fearsa dystopianfuture where tech platforms are dominated by a few companies and the most successful apps are cloned by those companies to maximize profits. 
    

            “[The companies] will just do that industry by industry and app category by app category until they’ve gobbled up everything that matters. And who will be left?” said Sweeney. “A million indie developers who collectively together make a small percentage of revenues on the app store because these businesses are too small to be attractive to steal.”
    

            In what Epic’s best case scenario, the court could rule that Apple and Google are prohibited from bundling payment services with their app stores, allowing developers to be paid directly, according to legal experts. 
    

            Butif Epic loses, it will at least make clear what the limits of antitrust law are, so people with similar grievances can look to appeal Congress for antitrust reform, according to John Bergmayer, legal director of consumer rights group Public Knowledge.
    

            “I think [Epic winning the lawsuits] would be pretty good for the markets overall,” said Mitch Stoltz, senior staff attorney of the nonprofit digital rights group Electronic Frontier Foundation, in an August interview. “You’d see more experimentation. You’d see more business models. You’d see more innovation.”
    

            As for Sweeney, he’s optimistic Epic can change the industry.
    

            “It’s Epic fighting or pressing for change and succeeding, and it’s not that unusual,” he said. “We’ve done it many times and everybody in the industry has benefited often.”

            Call it a Mac mini: Target is opening scaled-down versions of Apple stores at some of its US outlets this year, furthering the two companies’ relationship.
    

            Target said an “enhanced Apple shopping experience” is rolling out to 17 stores in the coming months, with redesigned sections that include new lighting and displays for shoppers to experiment with an expanded assortment of Apple products. Target staff will receive “specialized training” from Apple, the retailer said. 
    

            Target is also updating Apple’s product page on its app and website. Customers will still need to visit an actual Apple store for product repairs. 
    

            “Apple products are popular with Target’s guests, and this new, dedicated shopping experience offers enhanced service and expanded offerings, building on our strength as a go-to destination for electronics,” said Christina Hennington, executive vice president and chief growth officer at Target, in a press release. 
    

            Target is rolling out the new Apple mini-stores at five locations in Texas and four in Florida with the remaining scattered across various states including New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. The new Apple sections will be added to more Target stores in the coming years.
    

            It’s the latest high-profile partnership Target
            
                (TGT) has struck as it continues to evolve into a one-stop destination for customers who are increasingly looking to avoid shopping at malls. Cosmetics and beauty chain Ulta
            
                (ULTA) announced in January that it is opening 1,000 square-foot mini shops in roughly 100 Target
            
                (TGT) stores. Similar deals have been struck with Disney and FAO Schwartz. 


            Electronics are a major sales driver for Target: Over the most recent holiday shopping period, sales in the sector grew 20% compared to the year prior. Target reports its fourth-quarter earnings next week.

One of Apple's more controversial tech features may be going away this year. Many won't miss it,https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/07/tech/apple-macbook-touch-bar-2021/index.html,"Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

Apple may be doing away with one of its most divisive pieces of technology this year, and some fans aren’t sorry to see it go. 
    

            While the MacBook Pro design hasn’t changed significantly in five years, Apple will eliminate its digital Touch Bar, according to a January memo from Ming-Chi Kuo, a top Apple analyst with TF International Securities. CNN Business translated the memo from Chinese.
    

            Apple first unveiled the Touch Bar on the MacBook Pro in 2016. It’s a small rectangular OLED touchscreen that replaced the row of function keys at the top of the keyboard. Its digital interface includes other features like text prediction and shortcuts. Apple app developers are able to make software to take advantage of the touchscreen’s capabilities.
    

Apple fans are divided on how they feel about the Touch Bar. Some love it for the ease of use, but others miss the physical buttons it replaced.
    

            Kuo’s memo predicts that the Touch Baris going away intwo 2021 MacBook Pro models, a 14-inch laptop and a 16-inch laptop, and that the old physical buttons will return. Apple didn’t respond to a request for comment. 
    

            Apple may be dumping the Touch Bar because of fans’ mixed response, said Carolina Milanesi, tech analyst at research firm Creative Strategies.
    

            “Apple might not have seen as much demand, and of course, the added cost then becomes an issue for Apple when it is not seen as a value to the user,” said Milanesi. The lower demand also “limited the level of interest from developers, which in turn, limited how useful the bar could be.”
    

            The Touch Bar’s controversial legacy was clear from its introduction in 2016.
    

            “When Apple first unveiled the Touch Bar, reception was quite polarized,” said Linn Huang, research vice president of devices and displays. “Many were confused by what problems it was intended to solve and wondered how developers would integrate it into their software experience.”
    

            Fans eager for a MacBook with touch screen capabilities weren’t satisfied by the Touch Bar either — they expecteda full touch screen, said Huang. But loyal fans “found the Touch Bar to be a nice addition to the vaunted Apple user experience.”
    

            Both Milanesi and Huang expect Apple to release a touch screen MacBook again in the future. Once that happens, “history will remember the Touch Bar as a momentary half-concession between Apple and its loyal fans,” said Huang.
    

            Mark “Soldier Knows Best” Watson, a tech YouTuber with more than 800,000 subscribers, said that the Touch Bar “was a complete change to something that we all have become accustomed to.”
    

            While it helped Apple “visually modernize” the new MacBooks,“sometimes the uniqueness of the Touch Bar could cause you to have to do a couple of key presses instead of one like on a traditional keyboard,” he noted. 
    

            If Apple hadn’t replaced all physical function keys with the Touch Bar, it might have been less controversial, he said.
    

            Apple did return the escape key to 16-inch MacBook Pro in 2019 and to the 13-inch model in 2020.
    

            Dave “Dave2D” Lee, a tech Youtuber with more than 3 million subscribers, wants the Touch Bar gone. He misses tactile function keys like volume, brightness and media controls that the Touch Bar replaced. 
    

            Those function keys were likely “baked into muscle memory” for some Mac users and the Touch Bar is not nearly as reliable, he said.
    

            “Maybe I’m old school, but I’d like them to keep it simple,” he said. “A good keyboard without any special tricks. That’s always a winner.”

            Apple and Epic are nearing their highly anticipated Fortnite trial and plan to bring forward some top executives to testify in-person.
    

            The case concerns a fallout between the maker of one of the world’s most popular video games and the preeminent mobile device company over Apple’s control of its App Store. Epic is suing Apple for alleged antitrust violations.
    

            Apple
            
                (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, software engineering chief Craig Federighi and Apple
            
                (AAPL) fellow Phil Schiller are a few of the executives that may testify, according to a court filing of tentative witnesses. Others include those who handle payment processing, combating fraud and those involved with App Store development, policies and tools. 
    

            “Our senior executives look forward to sharing with the court the very positive impact the App Store has had on innovation, economies across the world and the customer experience over the last 12 years. We feel confident the case will prove that Epic purposefully breached its agreement solely to increase its revenues, which is what resulted in their removal from the App Store,” Apple said in a statement. “By doing that, Epic circumvented the security features of the App Store in a way that would lead to reduced competition and put consumers’ privacy and data security at tremendous risk.” 
    

            Epic Games’ plans to call its founder and CEO Tim Sweeney and other senior executives to testify on matters such as its business model, financial performance and its campaign against app stores. Epic declined to comment. 
    

            The iPhone maker and creator of popular video game Fortnite have been ensnarled in a legal battle since last year after Apple removed the Fortnite game from its App Store in August. The removal came after Epic pushed a software update to the app that allowed players to circumvent Apple’s proprietary in-app payment system of 30% – which is contractually prohibited. Google also removed Fortnite from its store. 
    

            Sweeney believes that the requirement violated antitrust laws because it forced developers to use Apple and Google’s payment systems. Epic then filed lawsuits against both tech companies after the store removals, arguing that the courts should intervene and order Apple and Google to allow developers to sell in-app purchases without the 30% revenue cut.
    

            The Apple versus Epic Games trial could begin as early as May 3, according to court documents.

'Calls' dials streaming TV back to what creepily feels like radio drama,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/18/entertainment/calls-review/index.html,"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            The newish medium of streaming is perhaps inevitably taking TV to its logical endpoint – namely, a weird return back to radio. At least, that’s the sense watching (or really, listening to) “Calls,” an Apple TV+ throwback to Orson Welles’ famous “War of the Worlds” radio broadcast mixed with “The Twilight Zone,” reminding us that sometimes what you hear is scarier than what you see.
    

            Adapted from a French series, the show employs minimal graphics – abstract waves and lines, coupled with what amount to word balloons of the dialogue – as the stories unfold over nine episodes, most running less than 20 minutes.
    

            Directed by Fede Álvarez (“Don’t Breathe”), the creepy threads play out through a series of seemingly unrelated phone calls, each featuring characters involved in stories that involve strange, supernatural phenomena. In one, for example, a man calls home after a fight with his wife, unaware that vast amounts of time are elapsing on the other end of the line during what he’s perceiving as mere minutes.
    

            Each story proceeds along those lines, in a way that feels unrelated but which comes together unexpectedly. The first and second episodes are rather coyly titled “The End” and “The Beginning,” offering a rough road map of how everything in between – that is, the remaining seven – might be connected.
    

            Practically speaking, it’s a remarkably efficient way of grappling with Covid-19 production concerns, and certainly a low-impact approach in terms of cost and talent, with the voices of Rosario Dawson, Pedro Pascal, Lily Collins and Clancy Brown among those featured. And the graphics prove surprisingly effective in setting the mood, with a separate Spanish-language version planned for Latin American markets.
    

            “Calls” works in part because it represents a change of pace, built around the notion that the horrors conjured by our imagination often surpass anything that millions of dollars in special effects can visualize. Yet it also speaks to the freedom that the sheer abundance of content platforms allows in terms of playing with formats, especially when doing so inexpensively.
    

            Of course, streaming services engage in all kinds of stunts in order to gain attention, and there’s no denying that this amounts to a bit of a gimmick. Even so, for the couple of hours in our time that it takes to watch/listen to the chapters, “Calls” is an invitation worth answering.
    

“Calls” premieres March 19 on Apple TV+.

            Apple’s Siri will soon stop defaulting to a female-sounding voice. 
    

            The company said Wednesday that its mobile devices will ask users to pick from a range of voices when they set up the virtual assistant. Apple currently allows users to pick between a male and female voice as well as six different accents including American, British, Indian and Irish, but defaults to a female voice for US devices. (In some countries, such as the UK, Siri defaults to a male voice.)
    

            Apple
            
                (AAPL) also said it will add two new voices to Siri.
    

            “We’re excited to introduce two new Siri voices for English speakers and the option for Siri users to select the voice they want when they set up their device,” Apple said in a statement. “This is a continuation of Apple’s long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, and products and services that are designed to better reflect the diversity of the world we live in.”
    

            The changes to Siri arealready available in Apple’s iOS 14.5 beta, and will take effect for those setting up a new Apple device when the software update rolls out more widely later this year.
    

            Gender stereotypes among voice assistants such as Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and the Google Assistant have long been a concern. In 2019, a United Nations report warned that voiceassistants perpetuate the idea that “women are obliging, docile and eager-to-please helpers, available at the touch of a button or with a blunt voice command.”
    

            Most virtual assistants still default to a female voice, though users have the option to switch.

"5 benefits of apple cider vinegar (and a few duds), according to experts",https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/health/benefits-of-apple-cider-vinegar-wellness/index.html,"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            Apple cider vinegar is one of the most popular natural health products around, with claims that it can do almost anything, including sanitizing toothbrushes, curing diabetes and whittling waistlines. 
    

            What are the real benefits of apple cider vinegar, according to science? CNN asked seven experts and looked at dozens of studies to bring you the facts. 
    

            Here arefive ways apple cider (or any vinegar) can help your health – plusa few popular misconceptions that didn’t pass muster.
    

            What’s the most popular use for apple cider vinegar? If a simple internet search is any measure, it involves diabetes.
    

            Registered dietitian Carol Johnston has been studying the effects of acetic acid, the main component of vinegar, on diabetic blood glucose levels, since 2004. 
    

            No vinegar, including apple cider, has been shown in studies to significantly alter or prevent diabetes, said Johnston, a professor of nutrition and an associate dean in the College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University.
    

            “If I was to show that vinegar slows progression to diabetes, then I would need hundreds of people and millions of dollars to do the studies, because diabetes has a lot of causes, including genetics,” Johnston said.

            But studies do show acetic acid can be used as one tool in helping people lower blood sugar. A 2019 randomized clinical trial found “a 10 point decrease in fasting glucose concentrations,” Johnston said. “They used two ‘spoons’ of vinegar in a glass of water twice a day (with the lunch and dinner meals).”
    

            In Johnston’s research, the people who benefited most from the use of vinegar were insulin-resistant, a condition called prediabetes.
    

            “In those with prediabetes, it was too good to be true,” she said. “It fell a good bit and stayed that way. It may be this is the group that could benefit the most.”
    

            It’s not just apple cider – the antiglycemic response can be induced by any sort of vinegar: red and white wine vinegars, pomegranate vinegar or even white distilled vinegar. 
    

            But, it only worked in the presence of a starch, she stressed.
    

            “Basically, what acetic acid is doing is blocking the absorption of starch,” Johnston said. “If my study subjects eat a starch and add vinegar, blood glucose will go down. But if they drink sugar water and add vinegar, nothing happens. So if you’re having bacon and eggs, don’t bother. It only helps if you are consuming a starch.”
    

            If you choose to use apple cider vinegar, be sure to tell your doctor, said registered dietitian and CNN contributor Lisa Drayer.
    

            “If you’re taking a diabetes drug, the vinegar could amplify the effects of your meds,” she warned, “and your doctor might want to adjust your dosage.”
    

Weight loss, or dieting, is another popular use for apple cider vinegar, and there is some evidence that it can help. 
    

            The most cited study was done with 175 heavy but otherwise healthy Japanese subjects. The 12-week treatment produced lower body weight, body mass index, visceral fat, waist measurements and triglyceride levels. Sounds great, right?
    

            “People didn’t really lose that much weight,” Drayer said. “Only 2 to 4 pounds in three months over a placebo. That’s only a third of a pound a week.”
    

            Johnston agreed the study showed “a very, very modest weight loss. In fact, I would say most people who are on a diet for 12 weeks and only lose a couple of pounds aren’t going to be very happy.”
    

            If you are using apple cider or other vinegars as one part of an overall plan, combining it with a healthy diet, portion control and exercise, it might help, Drayer said. She suggested using balsamic vinegar on salads, in a 4:1 ratio with oil, or adding it to sauces for poultry and fish.
    

            “If you were doing all the other things to lose weight, it might give you a slight edge. Also, if you’re drinking it in water, that’s good, as water makes you feel full,” Drayer said.
    

            “Sometimes, people get really excited to try something new, and then their other behaviors change, too,” she added. “If this helps people be more careful overall, that’s a good thing.”
    

            But be careful. A paper published last year by Johnston found vinegar can erode tooth enamel. If you do take vinegar for blood sugar, “this stresses the importance of taking the vinegar in a diluted form and with a meal to minimize this effect,” Johnston said, adding that “drinking through a straw might even be better!”
    

            Used for centuries to preserve food items such as pickles and pig’s feet, vinegar is now becoming popular as a natural preservative in processed meat and poultry items as well.

            Most home pickling uses 5% distilled white vinegar because it doesn’t affect the color of the vegetables or fruits, but apple cider vinegar is a popular choice because of its mellow, fruity flavor. Do know, however, that it will turn most fruits and veggies dark. 
    

            Another popular use for apple cider and other vinegars is as a food wash to reduce bacteria or viruses on the surface of fruits and vegetables. Studies have had varying results, often depending on the type of fruit or vegetable and the amount of time spent in the vinegar solution. 
    

            Canada’s National Collaborating Centre for Environmental Health says vinegars “may damage the organoleptic properties of produce,” or how they taste and smell, and has “limited antimicrobial efficacy.”
    

            The internet got this right: Apple cider vinegar is good to ease the sting or itch of bug bites.
    

            “I do love it for bites, especially mosquito bites,” said dermatologist Dr. Marie Jhin, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Dermatology. 
    

            “It’s a very underutilized home remedy. If you have a lot of bites, put two cups in a full tub of water and soak. It will help with itching,” she said. 
    

            The internet also touts apple cider vinegar as a treatment for skin infections and acne, a way to fight lice and dandruff, as a natural wart remover or an anti-aging treatment.
    

            “It will dry out a pimple, but it’s not an anti-aging method,” Jhin said. “I wouldn’t recommend it. We have much more effective and safe methods today than this.”

            While it can help with sunburn, there are many other good remedies so “we don’t usually suggest that to patients,” Jhin said. 
    

            Don’t turn to it to get rid of head lice or warts, either. One study found vinegar to be the least effective natural method to eliminate lice, and as for warts, they “are caused by a virus, so there’s no cure,” Jhin explained. 
    

            “You can dab a diluted version of apple cider vinegar on a wart with a Q-tip, and it’s going to help remove dead skin, which is what we do in the office by paring it down, cutting it out or burning it with liquid nitrogen. But it’s not going to be as fast or effective as what we do in the office,” she said.
    

            American Academy of Dermatology spokesperson Dr. Michael Lin, director of the Advanced Dermatology and Skin Cancer Institute in Beverly Hills, has a more negative perspective on home use.
    

            “I’ve had quite a few patients harmed by apple cider vinegar,” Lin explained. “One terrible example was a man trying to treat genital warts. When he came into the office, the entire area was raw, burned by the vinegar. 
    

            “I don’t know if he was using it full strength, but whatever he was doing it was too strong,” he continued. “He probably has permanent scarring from that natural home treatment.”
    

            Lin said he feels more comfortable recommending distilled white vinegar, as it is created to a standardized formulation of 5% acidity.
    

            “With apple cider vinegar, you don’t know what strength you’re getting,” Lin said. “It depends on the brand, and even among batches within a brand, you could get different concentrations of acidity.”
    

            “If you do choose to use apple cider vinegar, try to buy a name brand that clearly labels the acidity level. And whatever you do, don’t use it full strength.” 
    

            He suggested a 1:10 ratio.
    

            Because of apple cider vinegar’s antimicrobial properties, it is often suggested as a natural cleanser for the home. 
    

            The acid is effective against mold, but according to the Pesticide Research Institute, an environmental consulting firm, so are salt, lemon juice, hydrogen peroxide, tea tree oil and baking soda. 
    

            Many of those also smell better. 
    

            Apple cider vinegar is biodegradable, and because of its low pH, it’s great against alkaline grime such as hard water and mineral deposits, as well as soap scum. 
    

            But it won’t cut grease. Why not? Just think of a simple oil and vinegar salad dressing. After mixing, the oil and vinegar quickly separate because oil is nonpolar, while vinegar and water are polar, meaning they are not attracted to each other.  
    

            Will apple cider or other vinegars sanitize or disinfect your home? Probably not enough to make you feel germ-free.
    

            This 1997 study showed that undiluted vinegar had some effect on E. coli and salmonella, but a study conducted in 2000 showed no real impact against E. coli or S. aureus, the common staphylococcus bacteria responsible for most skin and soft tissue infections. 
    

            That2000 study also showed vinegars to be quite effective against the waterborne bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, mostly found in hospitals and untreated hot tubs. It was also effective against Salmonella enterica, a rare pig-borne version of salmonella. 
    

            If you do choose to use a vinegar to clean your home, never mix it with bleach or ammonia, because it will create toxic chlorine or chloramine gases.
    

It’s a no for coughs and sore throats. The use of vinegar medicinally starts with the father of modern medicine, Hippocrates. He would mix it with honey and use it for chronic coughs and sore throats, and the suggestion continues today across the internet.

            Many parents might think this is a natural and safe option for their children. The American Academy of Pediatrics doesn’t have an official stance on the use of apple cider or other vinegars as a health aid, but spokeswoman Dr. Jennifer Shu urges caution.
    

            “I would just think that the vinegar would irritate the throat even more,” said Shu, an Atlanta pediatrician and author of “Food Fights.” “But diluting it and mixing it with other ingredients such as salt or honey might decrease any pain that the vinegar might cause.”
    

            Arizona State’s Johnston cautions against trying any vinegar straight, because of the risk of inhaling the liquid and damaging the lungs.
    

            “Vinegar has that strong smell and puckering taste, so if you take a breath, you could inhale it into your lungs as you swallow,” she said. “It can burn the lungs a little, because it is an acid.”
    

            “It can also burn your esophagus,” said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention at National Jewish Health in Denver. “And if you’re predisposed to reflux, ulcers or stomach problems, it could certainly make those worse.”
    

It’s a double NO for teeth cleaning and whitening. “Some people like to use it to remove stains and whiten their teeth,” according to one of many online articles touting apple cider vinegar for this purpose. 
    

            “I let out an audible gasp when I read about this! It made me cringe, to be honest with you,” said Chicago dentist and American Dental Association spokesperson Dr.Alice Boghosian. “You’re putting acid on your teeth, the last thing you’d want to do to promote oral health.” 
    

RELATED: Coffee as a health food – myth or fact?


            A pH of 7 is neutral, and anything less is acid, Boghosian said, adding that many of today’s popular apple cider vinegars are in the 2 to 3 pH range – about the same as stomach acid. 
    

            “Anything acidic which contacts your teeth will wear out the enamel, the protective coating, and that will cause cavities,” Boghosian added. “This is totally, completely wrong, unless you want to be paying more visits to your dentist.”
    

            A healthier option would be to brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes with a whitening toothpaste with the American Dental Association seal, she said. “That shows it’s been tested to do what it’s supposed to do.” 
    

            Other articles promote rinsing your mouth with apple cider vinegar, soaking dentures with a diluted mixture or using it to clean a toothbrush.
    

            “You just have to rinse off your toothbrush, get all the toothpaste out, and let it air out. That’s all you have to do,” Boghosian said. “Cleaning dentures or rinsing with vinegar is not a good idea. It, too, could put your teeth at risk. And just think how it might affect the metal on partial dentures.”
    

Heart disease and cancer? Only if you’re a rodent. If you’re a rat worried about heart disease, put apple cider and other vinegars on your shopping list. 
    

            Studies show the vinegar can reduce blood pressure, triglycerides and total cholesterol in rodents fed a high-fat, cholesterol-rich diet. But full-blown studies have not been conducted in humans. 
    

            Freeman, who serves on the American College of Cardiology’s prevention board, said there could be some benefit because of its antioxidant properties, like other heart-healthy fruits and vegetables, such as broccoli and blueberries.
    

            “There are some indicators that using vinegar can improve arterial health and improve blood cholesterol, and there’s even more power if combined with green leafy vegetables,” Freeman said.
    

            “The data is not particularly strong or overwhelming, but vascular health may be enhanced,” Freeman said. “What’s best to avoid heart disease is to exercise and eat a low-fat, plant-based diet.”

            Freeman further recommends using apple cider or other vinegars on salads to maximize the benefits and reduce any reactions to the acidity.
    

            What about cancer? Japanese scientists have inhibited the growth of human leukemia and other cancer cells in petri dishes by exposing them to sugar cane vinegar and Japanese rice vinegar.  Other studies showed a reduction in tumors and a prolonged life by adding rice vinegars to drinking water and food in rats and mice, respectively.
    

            Studies in humans are nonexistent.
    

            So, does apple cider vinegar measure up to its positive internet reputation? If you consider that almost any other vinegar will produce the same benefits, not so much. 
    

            There arealsosome serious downside, if used full strength and inappropriately. As the experts suggest, make sure you check with your doctor before giving it a try.
    

            “When you do a search for apple cider vinegar, you see so many claims, and people will try it, searching for that natural cure-all,” Drayer said. 
    

            “Whether any of those claims are based on science is another matter.”

Apple cider vinegar and weight loss -- what the experts say,https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/24/health/apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss-wellness/index.html,"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            The claims are everywhere: If you add apple cider vinegar to your daily diet, it will help you lose weight. “Helps maintain a healthy weight range,” declares one manufacturer.


            “A lot of this is marketing,” said registered dietitian and CNN contributor Lisa Drayer. “Consumers get those messages, and they think, ‘Oh, this must be the next magic bullet.’ But whether it’s based on science is another matter.”
    

            A lot of the research on vinegar’s relationship with weight loss is in animals, mainly mice and rats. Studies show that acetic acid, the main component of apple cider vinegar, can suppress body fat accumulation and metabolic disorders in obese rats. But of course, mice are not men, and rats are not women, so these findings prove little.
    

            Studies in humans have been small, which limits their validity.

            “For example, some research suggests that it might promote satiety and make you consume fewer calories throughout the day,” Drayer said. “But the research is very limited, with small sample sizes, and is far from conclusive.”
    

            A 2005 study of 12 people found participantsfelt fuller when vinegar was consumed witha meal that included bread.A 2013 study of 16 people found the sameresult, but only because the vinegar caused nausea when ingested. “On this basis, the promotion of vinegar as a natural appetite suppressant does not seem appropriate,” that study concluded.
    

            The most-cited study to explore a connection to weight loss was done in 2009 with 175 “obese” Japanese subjects, ages 25 to 60, who were split into three groups. Considered “obese” by Japanese standards, each subject’s body mass index (BMI) was between 25 and 30; in the United States, people aren’t considered obese until their BMI exceeds 30. Anyone who had high cholesterol or diabetes or was using medications was excluded from the study.
    

            Over a 12-week period, the groups consumed a beverage each day with either one tablespoon of vinegar, two tablespoons of vinegar or no vinegar at all. At the end of the three months, those who consumed any amount of vinegar had a lower body weight, a smaller body mass index, less visceral fat, a smaller waist measurement and lower triglyceride levels than the placebo group that drank no vinegar. 
    

            That sounds fantastic until you look closely at the amount of weight that was lost.
    

            “Only 2 to 4 pounds in three months over a placebo,” Drayer explained. “That’s only a third of a pound a week. Most diets have a much bigger result. So you would definitely have to do many other things to accomplish any significant weight loss.”
    

            Registered dietitian Carol Johnston has been studying the effects of acetic acid on diabetic blood glucose levels since 2004. While she believes the Japanese study’s findings make sense because they are in line with animal research, she too is quick to point out that the weight loss in humans was “very, very modest.”
    

            “In fact, I would say most people who are on a diet for 12 weeks and only lose a couple of pounds aren’t going to be very happy,” said Johnston, an associate dean in the College of Health Solutions at Arizona State University. 
    

            Some claims revolve around using vinegar supplements to lose weight. 
    

            “I remember, probably 15 years ago, covering the apple cider vinegar diet,” Drayer said. “When you looked closely, the diet paired apple cider vinegar pills with a low-calorie menu. It’s no wonder people lost weight.”

            Many people prefer to ingest vinegar via a pill because liquid vinegar is acidic and can cause nausea. But commercial vinegar pills do not have the same effect on lowering blood glucose as liquid vinegar, according to research done by Johnston.


            If you choose to add vinegar to your diet, Johnston recommends that the tablespoon of vinegar is added to a full glass of water. Properly diluting vinegar is key. Otherwise, it can damage your teeth, throat and stomach lining.
    

            “Vinegar has that strong smell and puckering taste, so if you take a breath, you could inhale it into your lungs and burn those a little, because it’s an acid,” Johnston said.
    

            Where Johnston’s research has shown significant benefits from vinegar, however, is in blood sugar control. Over the years, she’s done a number of studies that show vinegar helps control blood sugar spikes for people with Type 2 diabetes and those who are prediabetic, also known as insulin-resistant. She’s even seen a slight benefit for healthy control subjects.
    

            “Vinegar had an impact in all groups, but the most significant impact was in the prediabetic group,” she said. “In prediabetics, it was too good to be true; (blood sugar) fell a good bit and stayed that way. It may be this is the group that could benefit the most.”

            The theory, according to Johnston, is that acetic acidappears to interfere with enzymes that break down starch molecules. This antiglycemic response can be induced by any sort of vinegar, such as red and white wine vinegars, pomegranate vinegar or even white distilled vinegar. It’s the acetic acid in the vinegar, not the type, that produces the result. 
    

            “Basically, what acetic acid is doing is blocking the absorption of starch,” Johnston said. “If my study subjects eat a starch and add vinegar, glucose will go down. But if they drink sugar water and add vinegar, nothing happens. So if you’re having bacon and eggs, don’t bother. It only helps if you are consuming a starch.”
    

            It’s possible that blocking starch absorption may help with weight loss as well, Drayer said.
    

            “So if acetic acid is interfering with the breakdown of starch, what that means is that starch is not being digested,” she explained. “And if it’s not being digested, it’s not being absorbed into the bloodstream, and therefore it’s not contributing to calories.”

            Though the research on acetic acid’s benefits looks promising, nothing’s definitive. It could be that other elements in apple cider and other vinegars also play a role. Take the trace chemicals in vinegar that vary based on where each brand was fermented, for example. 
    

            “It could be that some of those ingredients are important or part of the effect we are seeing,” Johnson said. She added that it will take much larger randomized scientific trials to prove any cause and effect between vinegar and weight loss, and especially between vinegar and diabetes or cardiovascular risks.
    

            “Somebody, probably the federal government, is going to have to fund a multimillion-dollar grant and recruit hundreds of people at risk for diabetes and metabolic disorders to truly determine if vinegar is going to make a difference,” Johnston said. 
    

            But until those occur, Johnston sees no harm in using vinegar to control blood sugars after starchy meals. After all, balsamic and wine vinegars are part of the Mediterranean diet, long associated with heart health and other benefits.

            “Even in healthy people, that post-meal surge in blood sugar is a risk factor for heart disease, so in my mind, everyone should take advantage of the benefit that vinegar may provide. But I’d do it the way people have done for centuries, by adding it to their food,” Johnston said.
    

            “What I would recommend is adding vinegar to meals as a condiment, as it contains no calories,” Drayer said. “When you make a dressing, use three parts oil to one part vinegar. Or reverse it and do one part oil and three parts vinegar.”
    

            You can also use it with food preparation, Drayer added.
    

            “Dip your chicken with egg whites and bread crumbs mixed with balsamic vinegar for poultry or fish,” she said. “Or you can drink it in water, which may help as water makes you feel full.”
    

Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.
    

            But again, never drink vinegar straight, experts say, or you might injure your teeth, throat or stomach.
    

            “Dilute it in water, and drink before you eat or with the first bites of your meal,” Johnston said. “You want the acetic acid in stomach before the meal to do the most good,” she said. “Mediterranean people ate the salad with vinegar, then they ate the pasta.”

            Hot Stocks 




            “I’m a Mac” actor Justin Long is now a PC guy. 
    

            Nearly two decades ago, Long extolled the benefits of Mac computers while playing one opposite John Hodgman’s PC in Apple
            
                (AAPL)’s iconic “Get a Mac” commercials. Now, in a pointedjab at Apple
            
                (AAPL), Long is featured in a new Intel
            
                (INTC) ad where he appears much more excited about new Intel
            
                (INTC)-based PCs than the latest Mac laptops. 
    

            “Hello, I’m a — Justin. Just a real person, doing a real comparison between Mac and PC,” Long says in the new Intel commercial, an obvious play on the “Hello, I’m a Mac” intro to the old Apple ads. 
    

            “These are all PCs,” Long says as he surveys a collection of laptops in the new ad. “Oh yeah, Intel! Nice. My face just unlocked that, that’s so cool. And I’ve never seen a screen like that on a laptop.”
    

            He moves on to look at the Mac lineup: “So these are the newer Macs? Okay. So, gray and gray-er.” 
    

            The new commercial is the latest exchange of not-so-friendly fire between Intel and Apple in recent months.

Apple brings back John Hodgman's hapless ""PC"" to troll new Mac features


            Last fall, Apple went from being an Intel customer to competitor when it replaced the semiconductor giant’s x86 chips with its own M1 chips in the newest Mac lineup. Apple claimed its new chipsmake Macs significantly faster and quieter and give them longer battery life compared to previous Mac models and rival laptops. 
    

            In fact, reviving the theme of the old Apple ads was the iPhone maker’s idea. When it announced the new M1 Macs in November, Apple brought back Hodgman to again star as “PC guy” in a new ad. 
    

            “Hi, I’m a PC,” Hodgman says in Apple’s November ad. “Is there a time for questions? Good, because I have one. Why? Why make all these advancements? What’s the point?”
    

            Moves like Apple’s to make its own chips pose a real threat to Intel, which has long relied on dominating the PC business. In recent years, Intel has lost share in the PC market, among other challenges, and the company recently hired new CEO Pat Gelsinger to help right the ship. 
    

            At an Intel staff meeting in January, after Gelsinger was named the incoming CEO but before officially taking over the role, he told employees that the company has to “deliver better products” for PCs than anything “a lifestyle company in Cupertino” makes, a likely reference to Apple, according to a report from The Oregonian.
    

            The new commercial may be another indicator of how aggressive Gelsinger plans to be in countering Apple and other competitors as he attempts to return Intel to its former glory. Whether the ad convinces people to buy more PCs remains to be seen, but at least Intel now has Long’s support.

            Hot Stocks 




            As the pandemic drags on, big chains like Target and Nordstrom are looking for ways to keep consumers coming back to their stores.
    

            One go-to strategy is the store-within-a-store concept. It’s a way for one retailer to join forces with another by setting up a pop-up shop within their stores. 
    

            Industry analysts saythe approach has benefits for both parties. For instance, department store Kohl’s
            
                (KSS) is adding as many as 200 Sephora mini shops inside of its stores in 2021 as a way to expand its beauty and cosmetics category. For Sephora, the deal helps the retailer expand its market to Kohl’s
            
                (KSS) shoppers.
    

            Meanwhile, Target is opening mini Apple shops in a handful of its stores as it strives to become a one-stop shop to meet all of its consumers’ needs.
    

            “From Sephora co-locating in Kohl’s to Apple in Target stores, these collaborations bring complementary customer traffic and added income, especially for the host retailer,” said Burt Flickinger III, managing director of Strategic Resource Group. It’s also a way to get shoppers to visit stores more frequently, he said.
    

            “For stores like Kohl’s or Nordstrom, shoppers maybe go once a month or once a quarter. By adding a store-in-a-store, now you can get a Kohl’s shopper returning more often for their beauty and cosmetics needs,” said Flickinger.
    

            A number of merchants have already joined forces. Here are a few of the most recent “shop-in-shop” collaborations:
    

            Nordstrom and at-home fitness startup Tonal have teamed up to launch a handful of Tonal mini shops inside Nordstrom stores.
    

            The Tonal-branded pop-up stores are debuting this month in 40 Nordstrom locations across 20 states. The 50-square-foot shops will be located in the women’s activewear department. 
    

            Nordstrom said shoppers can see a demo of the gym or try a workout for themselves. 
    

            The home gym from San Francisco-based Tonal mounts to the wall like a flat screen television and uses “digital weights” where the resistance is personalized. The startup is backed by a slew of investors and athletes, including Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors.
    

            Industry analysts said the crossover appeal of this partnership is a good fit for consumers because Tonal’s pricey gyms could entice fans of Nordstrom, a chain considered to be high-end among its department store peers. The partnership also comes at a time when Nordstrom is battling sales declines and adapting its strategy to changing consumer preferences.
    

            “Retailers right now are looking for ways to boost customer traffic,” said Robert Passikoff, a retail industry expert and founder of consulting firm Brand Keys. “The Nordstrom
            
                (JWN)-Tonal partnership makes sense because it fits well with the customers of both brands. For Tonal, it’s a very smart way to get its products in front of more consumers because everyone knows Nordstrom
            
                (JWN), so it will benefit from this sense of borrowed equity.”
    

            Makeup sales have been walloped by the pandemic. But that’s not stopping Sephora from adding more stores outside of struggling malls.
    

            Sephora is set to open mini shops inside Kohl’s
            
                (KSS) stores, with the first 200 locations debuting in fall of 2021.
    

            The partnership with Kohl’s will replace an earlier one that Sephora struck with JCPenney that is slated to end in the next few years.
    

            For Kohl’s, the collaboration allows it to attract younger consumers with wider array of beauty products and prices.
    

            “Beauty is an area where Kohl’s is currently underdeveloped, so it doesn’t capture much spend from shoppers who are already in its stores,” said Neil Saunders, retail industry analyst and managing director of GlobalData. “Adding a Sephora automatically resolves this issue, and it also makes Kohl’s a more interesting destination, which may help to drive foot traffic.”
    

            From Sephora’s perspective, Saunders said Kohl’s provides access to many off-mall locations where Sephora is currently underrepresented.
    

            Kohl’s expects to have as many as 850 “Sephora at Kohl’s” shops in its stores by 2023, as well as an online shop later this year. 
    

            Target is opening scaled-down versions of Apple stores at some of its US locations this year.
    

            Target
            
                (TGT) said an “enhanced Apple shopping experience” is rolling out to 17 stores in the coming months, with redesigned sections that include new lighting and displays for shoppers to experiment with an expanded assortment of Apple products.
    

            Target is also updating Apple
            
                (AAPL)’s product page on its app and website. Customers will still need to visit an actual Apple
            
                (AAPL) store for product repairs.
    

            Target is rolling out the new Apple mini-stores at five locations in Texas and four in Florida with the remaining scattered across various states, including New York, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. The new Apple sections will be added to more Target stores in the coming years.
    

            It’s the latest high-profile partnership Target has struck as it continues to evolve into a one-stop destination for customers who are increasingly looking to avoid shopping at malls.
    

            Ulta Beauty is debuting its mini cosmetics shops inside of Target stores in 2021.
    

            As with Sephora’s mini shops in Kohl’s, this deal is expected to help Ulta
            
                (ULTA), which sells a mix of drugstore beauty and pricey brands that aren’t normally found in big box stores, reach younger and more budget-conscious consumers.
    

            For Target, it expands the retailer’s growing beauty business with new brands it didn’t carry before.
    

            The 1,000 square-foot mini shops will initially launch in 100 Target locations and on Target.com, and then ramping up to several hundred Target stores.
    

            “The benefit for Ulta is increased exposure. Ulta has an incredibly successful track record and, before the pandemic, was posting consistently strong growth,” said Saunders.

            Apple made good on its “Spring loaded” promise by unveiling a slew of new products at its annual Spring product launch event.
    

            From a new IPad Pro and redesigned, colorful iMacs to a purple iPhone, the long-awaited AirTag location tracker, and an updated Apple TV and remote, here’s a closer look at everything Apple announced on Tuesday.
    

            As expected, Apple unveiled an updated iPad Pro with a faster processor, 5G support, a Thunderbolt port so it can connect to more external monitors, and a Mini-LED display.
    

            The display will reportedly increase brightness, offer a higher contrast ratio, and improve power efficiencies for a longer battery life.
    

            Apple is also adding its powerful M1 chip to its iPad Pro line, enabling several software updates including better graphics, enhanced video effects and augmented reality features.
    

            An updated camera allows enhanced depth and better quality video, and a feature called Center Stage that automatically zooms out during video calls or meetings, depending on the number of people in the frame.
    

            The new iPad Pro starts at $799 and is available for order starting April 30.
    

            Apple announced a redesigned iMac featuring the company’s new in-house M1 chip.
    

            The new chip allowed Apple to shrink the internal hardware — building in a smaller logic board and replacing the thermal system that keeps the machine cool with two small fans. The new iMac is just 11.5 millimeters deep.
    

            The M1 chip will also make iMac apps run faster, improve the speed of machine learning and enable the use of iPhone apps such as Zillow and Headspace from the iMac screen, Apple execs said Tuesday.
    

            iMac will now have a 24-inch, 4.5 K display with 11.3 million pixels. And it comes in seven colors, including peach, mint and lavender.
    

            For users still working from home, Apple also improved the iMac’s camera. The 1080p camera’s features include auto white balance, noise reduction and tone mapping to make you look better. The computer also has a new mic designed to reduce feedback noise so you sound better, too.
    

            The new iMac starts at $1,299 for four colors, and $1,499 for the other three colors plus additional features. It will be available in the second half of May.
    

            Meanwhile, Apple is adding a touch ID button to the iMac’s external keyboard for the first time. The Touch ID button will be placed in the top right corner of the keyboard, like it is on the latest MacBooks, and will similarly let users unlock their computer, switch users or make payments through their fingerprints.
    

            Both the keyboard and Apple’s Magic Mouse will be available in a variety of colors to match with the new range of colors on the iMac.
    

            In what was Apple’s worst kept secret in recent history, the company finally unveiled AirTag, a Tile-like Bluetooth locator that attaches to and helps you find items such as keys, wallets, laptops or even your car.
    

            The small, flat, circular discs with built-in chips allow someone to locate items when connected to Apple’s Find My app. It also works with Siri.
    

            The stainless steel devices, which are water and dust resistant, feature a built-in speaker that plays sounds to help locate it. The AirTag is packed with the Apple-designed U1 chip, which uses Ultra Wideband technology – the same chip used in the iPhone 12.
    

            While location trackers are hardly new – there are similar products from Samsung, Sony and Tile — the U1 chip will more accurately determine the distance and direction to a lost item, Apple says.
    

            Similar to Apple Watch, it’s possible to add free engraving to the device.
    

            An AirTag is $29 each or four for $99, starting April 30. Users can also splurge for leather accessories, such as key rings, luggage tags and a bag charm from Hermès.
    

            Apple is rolling out the next generation of its Apple TV 4K streaming device, along with a new Siri remote.
    

            The remote, made from what Apple says is 100% recycled aluminum, includes a new pad at the top that users can click or swipe through to navigate, as well as a dedicated Siri button on the side.
    

            The remote also has a dedicated power button to switch your TV on and off. The new Apple TV will be available starting April 30, with a 32 GB version for $179 and a 64 GB version for $199
    

            Apple also redesigned its podcast app, including a new section called channels that will curate shows.
    

            The company also made changes to its Apple Card offering for spouses and families who share their credit card accounts. 
    

            Spouses can now merge and share their Apple Card credit lines, while having equal rights on the account and with each person building credit. For families, the company will now allow any member over the age of 13 to use the family Apple Card account. Apple Card is an Apple-branded credit card issued by Goldman Sachs that the company launched in 2019, available only to iPhone users. 
    

            Apple also announced a paid service for podcasts called Apple Podcast Subscriptions. Among the perks of a podcast subscription will be ad-free listening, early access to new series and exclusive content. Some of the participating media brands include NPR, the Los Angeles Times and The Athletic. The paid service will be available in 170 regions and countries next month. Podcast creators set their own pricing. 
    

            In a bit of a surprise, Apple dedicated some stage time to announce that the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini are now available in purple. This joins existing models available in blue, green, black, white and red. It starts at $799 and will go on sale April 30.

            Hot Stocks 




            Apple’s new iMac is awesome: a technical marvel and a culmination of Apple’s stunning engineering achievements over the past several years. It’s also ugly as sin.
    

            When Apple
            
                (AAPL) overdesigns its products, it’s typically for form over function. You know the list: getting rid of the headphone jack to make the iPhone thinner, ditching USB-A ports on MacBooks, switching the hinges on its keyboards…. They’re innovations that make Apple
            
                (AAPL)’s products look cool, but don’t make their products work any better.
    

            Strangely, Apple has chosen function over form with its new iMacs. 
    

            They’ll work great: The 8-core M1 chip on a desktop computer is going to be ohmygod fast — about twice as fast as the last iMac, Apple claims. The HD webcam, studio-grade microphones and surround-sound speakers are perfect for the Zoom era. Touch ID on the keyboard is a nice … touch.  The better-than-4K display is going to be *chef’s kiss.* 
    

            The only problem is you have to look at your new iMac when you’re using it.
    

            Ugh, those colors. It comes in Easter egg blue, green, yellow, pink, orange, purple and (thankfully) silver. If the colors weren’t bold enough, Apple added sorta faded complementary colors to the stand, which is an … interesting design choice.
    

            Even if you’re a pastel fan (or you wisely choose silver), you won’t be saved from the bizarre look of the new iMac. That weird chin that’s been a feature of the iMac since 2004 is still there, giving the new iMac a decidedly last-generation look. And the new version ditched the Apple logo, making that odd rectangle at the bottom of your screen look even stranger.
    

            It’s the kind of unforced error that Apple rarely makes. The M1 chip gave Apple a chance to completely rethink its iMac design. Instead, it chose to stick to the familiar shape, put the computer’s guts below the screen and make the iMac thinner. That comes with some advantages (more on that in a second), but the result is an aesthetic head-scratcher.

            The worst feature of the new iMac is the bezel — the white frame around the display.The chin makes the bezel really stand out. It was hardly noticeable in the past iMac iterations, because it was black. The white contrasts with the screen and the chin, giving the screen a seriously weird appearance. 
    

            It’s not 100% clear why Apple went this route, but the company left a few clues. 
    

            The new iMac is 11.5 millimeters thick, which is the thickness of about one and a half iPhone 12s. That’s insane. It comes with a magnetic power cable because you can move this thing around — it weighs less than 10 pounds. The new iMac kind of blurs the lines between desktop and laptop.
    

            But how many people move their desktop computers so often that they need something that thin and light? And for those people, would a few millimeters of thickness and another pound make that much of a difference? 
    

            When you’re looking at your all-in-one desktop, how often are you really concerned about its thickness? The screen is the thing you’re staring at, which is why Apple should have maximized the screen real estate and minimized everything else. 
    

            Apple probably designed the iMac so thin because it could not because it should. The result, for a company that makes some of the most beautiful gadgets ever conceived, was a big swing and a miss — something that looks like a cross between Jay Leno and an Easter egg.

AirTag could give a nice bump to Apple's growing lineup of smaller stuff,https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/20/tech/apple-airtags/index.html,"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            When people think Apple, they think big ticket items like iPhones, MacBooks and iPads. But the company’s accessories line of iPhone cases, chargers and tablet keyboards is a critical part of its revenue growth strategy. 
    

            Now AirTag could be its next big accessory win. 
    

            An AirTag is a Tile-like Bluetooth locator that attaches to and helps you find items such as keys, wallets, laptops or even your car. The small, flat, circular disc with a powerful built-in chip will allow someone to locate items when connected to Apple’s Find My app and also work with Siri.
    

            The stainless steel devices, which are water and dust resistant, feature a built-in speaker that plays sounds to better locate an AirTag. It’s packed with the Apple-designed U1 chip, which uses Ultra Wideband technology – the same chip used in the iPhone 12. 
    

            While location trackers are hardly new – there are similar products from Samsung, Sony and Tile – the U1 chip will allow it to more accurately determine the distance and direction to a lost item. It also works with augmented reality, showing an animation on the screen of the user’s iPhone or iPad when nearby. 
    

            AirTag has been reportedly in the works as far back as 2019, when pictures hidden within iOS 13 were discovered.
    

            AirTag costs $29 for each or $99 for four, starting April 30. Users can also splurge for leather accessories, such as key rings, luggage tags and a bag charm from Hermès. Similar to Apple Watch, it’s possible to add free engraving to the device.
    

            “Apple accessories are very important from a business perspective because they tend to be high-margin products,” said Ben Stanton, senior analyst at tech market research firm Canalys. “So while accessories may not make headlines from a revenue perspective, they do have a particularly positive impact on profitability.”

What to expect at Apple's 'Spring loaded' event


            The arrival of AirTag will allow the company to expand its offerings and lock users deeper into its ecosystem as it looks for more ways to take on an expected decline in its hardware revenues. The iPhone continued to dominate Apple’s revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020, accounting for 59% of sales, compared to 12% for its accessories category, which also includes wearables and its Home line. However, the accessories category amounts to more revenue than its Mac line.
    

            Still, Apple accessories remain a massive opportunity for upselling. Because Apple no longer includes a charger and cable in iPhone boxes upon purchase, demand for these items has surged in the past year. “Apple itself has seen supply shortages of charging accessories in some parts of the world, causing many customers and retailers to lean heavily on third-party alternatives,” said Stanton, citing anecdotes he’s heard from several distributors. 
    

            In addition, the company’s smart Magic Keyboard and the Apple Pencil opens up new revenue streams as lower-cost iPad users look for more functionality. 
    

            “Although AirTags are probably going to be fairly low priced, they may help to grow revenue, and users may buy multiple tags for different scenarios, such as for a bag, bike or car keys,” said David McQueen, director at tech market advisory firm, ABI Research. “It may also spark a rise in the manufacture of accessories to house the tags, such as a key fob, keychain or wrist strap.”
    

            Customers who are delaying costly smartphone and tablet upgrades may be willing to spend more on lower cost items such as these. 
    

            It’s a smart time for their launch as customers are finally emerging from over a year of lockdown — ready, perhaps, to find things people invariably lose when outside the house.

            Hot Stocks 




            If the “Spring loaded” tagline of Apple’s upcoming press event is any indication, the company is about to drop a ton of new products.
    

            Apple
            
                (AAPL) is hosting its first event of 2021 on Tuesday and it’ll likely focus on new iPads, along with a product that’s been years in the making.
    

            Apple’s event kicks off at 1:00 pm ET/10:00 am PT on its website, YouTube and Apple TV.
    

            The invitations for the virtual press conference sent to reporters last week included an image of colorful spirals that form the Apple logo — a picture potentially made to look as if it had been produced by an Apple Pencil, a clue hinting at updates to its iPad line. 
    

            The company’s invitations are often filled with red herrings, but Apple senior marketing executive Greg Joswiak added to the fodder when he tweeted a video featuring an animation of the spirals bouncing around Apple’s campus. It sparked speculation that augmented reality could also be part of the company’s presentation.
    

            Apple is expected to show off an updated iPad Pro with a faster processor, 5G support, a Thunderbolt port so it can connect to more external monitors and a Mini LED display. 
    

            The display will reportedly increase brightness, offer a higher contrast ratio, improve power efficiencies for a longer battery life but be slightly thicker than current versions. It’s possible Apple will also show off a redesigned iPad mini with smaller bezels and a larger display. But it’s unclear if any of these updates will be enough to convince users to upgrade.
    

            Eleftheria Kouri, an analyst at tech market advisory firm ABI Research, said tablet shipments significantly increased in 2020, thanks in part to remote learning and working. But that uptick won’t last forever. “Tablet vendors, including Apple, need to introduce a really game changing technological feature in order to boost sales and encourage consumers to replace their old devices: 5G connectivity is one of these key features,” she said.

AirTags could give a nice bump to Apple's growing lineup of smaller stuff 


            Perhaps the buzziest product in the rumor mill is the potential debut of AirTags, a Tile-like Bluetooth locator that attaches to and helps you find items such as keys, wallets, laptops or even your car. AirTags have been reportedly in the works as far back as 2019 when pictures hidden within iOS 13 suggested small, flat, circular discs with built-in chips could allow someone to locate items when connected to Apple’s Find My app.
    

            This is where AR could come into play. In iOS 13, a string of code stated: “Walk around several feet and move your ‌iPhone‌ up and down until a balloon comes into view,” indicating where an item may be hiding, according to MacRumors. 
    

            Not only is the Apple TV due for a new processor and better refresh support for gaming, a redesigned remote could work as a physical locator for AirTags, according to tech blog 9to5Mac.
    

            And then there’s AirPods 3. The next-generation of Apple’s wireless earbuds are believed to have a design more in line with its higher-end AirPods Pro, along with spatial audio support and touch controls. AirPods have cultivated a cult-like following over the years and emerged as a fashion and status symbol, but it’s possible Apple could wait until later this year to show off a new model. 
    

            Apple’s MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are also due for refreshes, but it’s unclear if they’ll get one as early as next week. Apple recently discontinued its iMac Pro line, once the most-powerful computer the company offered, and its original HomePod to focus more on the HomePod mini.
    

            The company could also walk users through an expected iOS 14.5 software update focused on privacy. Its upcoming App Tracking Transparency feature will require app developers to explicitly divulge how they’re collecting user data, what it’ll be used for, and require user consent before they download or update apps from the App Store.
    

            Still, all eyes will be on the lookout for new gadgets on Tuesday. “Despite the disruptions in the production line, crisis in the semiconductor industry and economic uncertainty that was caused by pandemic, demand for consumer products generally remained resilient,” said Kouri. 
    

            ABI Research expects demand for certain products, such as true wireless earbuds and 5G devices, will see explosive growth the coming years, but tech companies like Apple will first have to provide enough incentive for consumers to spend their dollars.

"April 2021 Apple event news: iPads, AirTag and a purple iPhone",https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/apple-event-april-20-2021/index.html,"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            Apple’s hour-long Tuesday event packed in a ton of announcements. They include: 
    

Also worth noting: Among the software updates in the new products are a number of features geared toward working from home, including improvements to the cameras in both the iMac and iPad Pro to make you look and sound better during video meetings. 
    

            Apple is adding its powerful M1 chip to the iPad Pro, enabling several software updates including better graphics, enhanced video effects and augmented reality features.
    

            An updated camera allows enhanced depth and better quality video, and a feature called Center Stage that automatically zooms out during video calls or meetings depending on the number of people in the frame.
    

            The Pro starts at $799 and is available for order from April 30.
    

            Apple announced a redesigned iMac featuring the company’s new in-house M1 chip. 
    

            The new chip allowed Apple to shrink the internal hardware — building in a smaller logic board and replacing the thermal system that keeps the machine cool with two small fans. The new iMac is just 11.5 millimeters deep. 
    

            The M1 chip will also make iMac apps run faster, improve the speed of machine learning and enable the use of iPhone apps such as Zillow and Headspace from the iMac screen, Apple execs said Tuesday.
    

            iMac will now have a 24-inch, 4.5 K display with 11.3 million pixels. And it comes in seven colors, including peach, mint and lavender.  
    

            For users still working from home, Apple also improved the iMac’s camera. The 1080p camera’s features include auto white balance, noise reduction and tone mapping to make you look better. The computer also has a new mic designed to reduce feedback noise so you sound better, too. 
    

            The new iMac starts at $1,299 for four colors, and $1,499 for the other three colors plus additional features. It will be available in the second half of May. 
    

            Apple is adding a touch ID button to the iMac’s external keyboard for the first time. The Touch ID button will be placed in the top right corner of the keyboard, like it is on the latest MacBooks, and will similarly let users unlock their computer, switch users or make payments through their fingerprints.
    

            Both the keyboard and Apple’s Magic Mouse will be available in a variety of colors to match with the new range of colors on the iMac.
    

            Apple is rolling out the next generation of its Apple TV 4K streaming device, along with a new Siri remote.
    

            The remote, made from what Apple says is 100% recycled aluminum, includes a new pad at the top that users can click or swipe through to navigate, as well as a dedicated Siri button on the side.
    

            The remote also has a dedicated power button to switch your TV on and off. The new Apple TV will be available starting April 30, with a 32 GB version for $179 and a 64 GB version for $199. 
    

Correction: An earlier version of this post suggested there hadn’t been an Apple TV with 4K before. This is the second generation of an Apple TV with 4K.


            Apple has another new subscription product: a paid service for podcasts called Apple Podcast Subscriptions. 
    

            Among the perks of a podcast subscription will be ad-free listening, early access to new series and exclusive content. Some of the participating media brands include NPR, the Los Angeles Times and The Athletic. 
    

            The paid service will be available in 170 regions and countries next month. Podcast creators set their own pricing. Apple’s Family Sharing is enabled so that up to six family members can share a podcast subscription. 
    

            Apple also redesigned its podcast app, including a new section called channels that will curate shows.
    

            In what was Apple’s worst kept secret in recent history, the company finally unveiled AirTag, a Tile-like Bluetooth locator that attaches to and helps you find items such as keys, wallets, laptops or even your car. 
    

            The small, flat, circular discs with built-in chips allow someone to locate items when connected to Apple’s Find My app. It also works with Siri. 
    

            The stainless steel devices, which are water and dust resistant, feature a built-in speaker that plays sounds to help locate an AirTag. It’s packed with the Apple-designed U1 chip, which uses Ultra Wideband technology – the same chip used in the iPhone 12. 
    

            While location trackers are hardly new – there are similar products from Samsung, Sony and Tile, the U1 chip will more accurately determine the distance and direction to a lost item. 
    

            Similar to Apple Watch, it’s possible to add free engraving to the device.
    

            You can buy an AirTag for $29 and a four pack for $99, starting April 30. Users can also splurge for leather accessories, such as key rings, luggage tags and a bag charm from Hermès.
    

            Among all the new product announcements was a slightly different reveal — a new color for the iPhone 12. Apple’s newest smartphone is now available in purple.
    

            The new purple iPhone 12 will be available for pre-order Friday and will go on sale April 30.
    

            Apple is making changes for spouses and families who share their Apple Card credit card accounts, features it is calling “Apple Card Family,” CEO Tim Cook announced Tuesday. 
    

            Spouses can now merge and share their Apple Card credit lines, while having equal rights on the account and with each person building credit. For families, the company will now allow any member over the age of 13 to use the family Apple Card account. 
    

Apple Card is an Apple-branded credit card issued by Goldman Sachs that the company launched in 2019, available only to iPhone users. It can be used as a physical card like other credit cards, as well as on Apple Pay to make contactless payments.
    

            Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the Apple event from the company’s Cupertino, California, campus, with a little assistance from augmented reality.
    

            The same colorful AR swirls that were included in invitations to the event made an appearance in a short video. The animation moved about Cook and formed the word “hello.
    

            Last week, Apple senior marketing executive Greg Joswiak added to the fodder when he tweeted a video featuring an animation of the spirals bouncing around Apple’s campus. It sparked speculation that augmented reality could also be part of the company’s presentation.
    

            The big show starts at 1pm ET/10 am PT and Apple is livestreaming it on a variety of platforms: 
    

            Along with hardware products, Apple may also announce new offerings from the services side of its business, Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson said in an email ahead of Tuesday’s event. 
    

            That could include new games for Apple Arcade or shows on Apple TV+. 
    

        Services have become a key pillar of Apple’s strategy and significant business and profit driver,” Husson said. 
    



            The new processors rumored to be coming for the Apple TV and iPad Pro would better support Arcade graphics, making the service more appealing to consumers.
    

            Apple may also mention the new Fitness+ offerings it announced last week, which included workouts geared toward pregnant people, older adults and beginners. 
    

            Last fall, the company introduced a bundle, called Apple One, that lets users access Apple TV+, Music, Arcade and other services with a single, monthly subscription payment. Apple said in January it has more than 620 million paid subscriptions across its services. 
    

            Perhaps the buzziest product in the rumor mill is the potential debut of AirTags, Apple’s long-rumored Bluetooth tracking device.
    

What are AirTags?


            The Tile-like locator attaches to and helps you find items such as keys, wallets, laptops or even your car. AirTags have been reportedly in the works as far back as 2019, when pictures hidden within iOS 13 suggested small, flat, circular discs with built-in chips could allow someone to locate items when connected to Apple’s Find My app. 
    

            The rumored cost: $39 each.
    

            AirTags are expected to include the same U1 ultra-wideband chip as the iPhone 12, which would make location tracking more accurate than competing devices from companies such as Tile, Samsung and Sony, according to MacRumors. 
    

Why now?


            The arrival of AirTags would allow the company to expand its offerings and lock users deeper into its ecosystem as it looks for more ways to combat an expected decline in its hardware revenues.
    

            While accessories for an accessory might sound like a stretch, customers who are delaying costly smartphone and tablet upgrades may be willing to spend more on lower cost items. That said, it’s possible AirTags could emerge as a category unto its own, much like AirPods.
    

            Either way, it would be a smart time for their launch as customers are finally emerging from over a year of lockdown — ready, perhaps, to find things people invariably lose when outside the house.
    

            Here are some other updates Apple could release today:
    

Apple TV


            Not only is the Apple TV due for a new processor and support for better refresh rates for gaming, a redesigned remote could work as a physical locator for AirTags, according to tech blog 9to5Mac.
    

AirPods 3


            The next-generation of Apple’s wireless earbuds are believed to have a design more in line with its higher-end AirPods Pro, along with spatial audio support and touch controls. 
    

            AirPods have cultivated a cult-like following over the years and emerged as a fashion and status symbol, but it’s possible Apple could wait until later this year to show off a new model.
    

MacBooks 


            Apple’s MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are also due for refreshes, but it’s unclear if they’ll get one as early as next week. Apple recently discontinued its iMac Pro line, once the most-powerful computer the company offered, and its original HomePod to focus more on the HomePod mini.
    

Software


            Apple could also walk users through an expected iOS 14.5 software update focused on privacy. Its upcoming App Tracking Transparency feature will require app developers to explicitly divulge how they’re collecting user data, what it’ll be used for, and require user consent before they download or update apps from the App Store.
    

            Also likely: new emojis, including one of a less graphic syringe amid the vaccine rollout.
    

            Apple’s Spring events are often a mixed big: We’ve seen launches around education, its streaming services and the budget-friendly iPhone SE. But this year, Apple is expected to show off an updated iPad Pro with a faster processor, 5G support, a Thunderbolt port so it can connect to more external monitors and a Mini LED display.
    

            The display is expected to increase brightness, offer a higher contrast ratio, improve power efficiencies for a longer battery life but be slightly thicker than current versions. It’s possible Apple will also show off a redesigned iPad mini with smaller bezels and a larger display. 
    

            But it’s unclear if any of these updates will be enough to convince users to upgrade.
    

            Eleftheria Kouri, an analyst at tech market advisory firm ABI Research, said tablet shipments significantly increased in 2020, thanks in part to remote learning and working. But that uptick won’t last forever. 
    

        “Tablet vendors, including Apple, need to introduce a really game changing technological feature in order to boost sales and encourage consumers to replace their old devices: 5G connectivity is one of these key features,” she said.

"No, the new iMac isn't ugly. The design and colors are a breath of fresh air",https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/23/tech/apple-imac-design/index.html,"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Hot Stocks 




            When Apple unveiled its colorful new iMac line at a virtual product launch earlier this week, reactions were divided: They’re beautiful. They’re ugly. What is with that ‘chin’? 
    

            The event was one of the most exciting product launches from any tech company in a while. Apple
            
                (AAPL) introduced an entirely new product — its AirTag location trackers — updated iPads, a revamped Apple
            
                (AAPL) TV, and the biggest design change to the iMac in years. 
    

            After being stuck inside for over a year, staring at lackluster computer screens, the iMac’s new look and vibrant colors are a breath of fresh air.
    

            Now at only 11.5 millimeters deep and just 10 pounds, the iMac resembles an iPad on a stand more than a standard computer. The desktop computer is so thin that Apple moved the headphone jack to the side of the display; it no longer fits in the back because that is now deeper than the screen itself. 
    

            The company’s new in-house M1 chip – a processor that will make everything run twice as fast as its predecessor – is tucked into what people have come to refer to as the chin, or the white frame that sits just below the screen. The previous iMac also featured a chin but had a large logic board and thermals due in part to its power-hungry processor, and other components such as CPU and GPU were separately located in the system. 
    

            Now with M1, everything is consolidated into a much smaller logic board. Conceivably, Apple could have sacrificed some thinness to eliminate the chin.
    

            Many people criticized the decision, calling the chin distracting and unbalanced with the rest of the screen. Memes circulated of what a similar design would look like on an iPhone.
    

            “Apple made a clear choice around the chin and it was the thin design that was front and center for this iMac design,” said Dan Ives, a director at investment firm Wedbush. “It is focused on creating a uniquely thin iMac, and for Apple, it’s about a 360 degree view, which is why the design team decided not to put the internals in the back.”

Apple made a big mistake with its new iMacs


            While some believe Apple could introduce a screen with less of a bezel in the months ahead, along with more traditional colors, its move to push out a bold design now with equally bold colors draws attention to the line, potentially encouraging more people to upgrade from their existing computers.
    

            Michael Heilemann, principal designer at website building and hosting company Squarespace, was among some designers who defended the Apple’s changes. “The new iMac makes it a statement again,” Heilemann told CNN Business. “Computers aren’t just for spreadsheets or for tucking in the drawer when you’re done. They can be a part of your identity same as your clothes and your furniture. You use them just as much, so why not? 
    

            “The thin, sleek design also means that even though it’s colorful and loud, it feels elegant,” he added.
    

            Rather than the space grays and whites of its usual color wheel, the new lineup offers iMacs in red, orange, yellow, blue, green, purple and silver. Both the keyboard and Apple’s Magic Mouse will be available in a variety of colors, too.
    

            Each color was hidden in the event’s press invitations, which are often filled with red herrings, and showed up again in the video at the start of the keynote featuring CEO Tim Cook. In the clip, an animation of colorful spirals bounced about Apple’s campus, ultimately forming the word “hello,” a reference that goes back to the very first Mac. It feels like a throwback to how Apple experimented with colors and a few patterns in the iMacs’ early days, as it looked for ways to stand out.
    

            “Up until the first iMac, they were at best inoffensive, trying to make the best of being an office appliance,” said Heilemann. “The iMac changed that and made it something people could have in their homes and not feel like it brought the office home with them.”
    

            Over time, Apple left the colors and eccentricities behind in favor of a more minimalistic, industrial design.
    

            While it’s unusual for desktops to come in so many colors, Ross Rubin, a principal analyst at Reticle Research, noted other companies have tried to stand out in different ways in recent years. HP’s all-in-one computer comes with a panoramic wide screen, Lenovo introduced one that rotates 90 degrees, and Microsoft’s Surface Desktop can be pulled down and forward to the point where it can be worked on as a tablet.
    

            “But the design of the iMac is striking,” Rubin said. “It will be difficult for PC makers to match that level of thinness for awhile unless they start leveraging ARM chips that they have used only in laptops up to this point.”
    

            Although the pandemic renewed interest in desktops as more people worked from home, it’s uncertain if the demand will continue as Covid-19 vaccines roll out and economies reopen. Still, it’s refreshing to see Apple, perhaps, thinking differently yet again.

            Hot Stocks 




            I clipped a keychain with one of Apple’s tiny new Bluetooth trackers, AirTags, onto my son’s book bag and waved goodbye to him on the school bus. I watched on my iPhone’s Find My app as the bus stopped at a light a few blocks down from our street.
    

            But then the tiny “key” icon on the app stopped moving. The item was “last detected” seven minutes ago at a busy intersection less than a mile away. Traffic, maybe? Five more minutes passed with no update. Is there an issue with the app? After another 10 minutes, my heart started to race; still nothing.
    

            Finally, the tracker was detected four miles away in front of his school. Relieved, I decided more information in this case was worse; I’d go back to just tracking my keys. Apple later told me the delay was due to the tracker needing to communicate with Bluetooth on other iOS devices in the Find My network along the bus route before the AirTag’s location could be updated to iCloud and the app.
    

            Still, my experiment highlighted how easily these trackers could be used to track another person. After all, I knew the moment he arrived at school and when he got back on the bus to head home.
    

            Earlier this month, Apple
            
                (AAPL) launched $29 Tile-like Bluetooth locators that attach to and help you find items such as keys, wallets, laptops or your car, giving nearly anything a digital footprint. Location trackers aren’t new — there are similar products from Samsung, Sony and Tile — but AirTags’ powerful Ultra Wideband technology chip allows it to more accurately determine the location and enables precise augmented reality directional arrows that populate on the iPhone or iPad’s screen.
    

            While AirTags are explicitly intended for items only, Apple has added safeguards to cut down on unwanted tracking. For example, the company does not store location data, and it will send an alert to an iOS device user if an AirTag appears to be following them when its owner is not around. If the AirTag doesn’t re-tether to the owner’s iOS device after three days, the tracker will start to make a noise.
    

            “We take customer safety very seriously and are committed to AirTag’s privacy and security,” the company said in a statement to CNN Business. “AirTag is designed with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking— a first in the industry— and the Find My network includes a smart, tunable system with deterrents that applies to AirTag, as well as third-party products part of the Find My network accessory program. We are raising the bar on privacy for our users and the industry, and hope others will follow.”
    

            The safeguards are a work in progress as the software rolls out and users begin interacting with the devices. When my babysitter recently took my son to an appointment, using my set of keys with an AirTag attached, she was not informed that she wascarrying anAirTag — separated from my phone. (She hadn’t yet updated her phone’s software to iOS 14.5.) 
    

            Non-iPhone users can hold their phones close to the AirTags and, via short-range wireless technology, information pops up on how to disable the tracker, but that’s if the person knows they’re being tracked and locates it. In addition, three days is a long time for an AirTag to keep quiet before making a noise.
    

            Apple told CNN Business it may adjust these features through software updates to improve the AirTags’ tracking deterrents. It also said the three-day alert window was determined so as to not inundate users with alerts. For example, if a spouse puts an AirTag on a gym bag and leaves it in a closet while at work, whoever is at home may consider the noise a nuisance.  
    

            Despite the safeguards, some privacy experts and groups are still concerned about unwanted tracking. For example, the National Network to End Domestic Violence — which sits on advisory boards of tech companies including Facebook and Uber — has been vocal about how AirTag and similar devices could be used by an abuser to discreetly monitor someone’s whereabouts.
    

            “Abusive individuals will misuse any type of technology as a tactic of abuse, regardless of the intended purpose or how helpful it can be to someone else,” Erica Olsen, safety net project director at NNEDV, told CNN Business. “Location tracking is very common and a significant concern for survivors, but this isn’t specific just to AirTags. Apple’s privacy and security notifications can actually make this device harder for abusive people to misuse than others on the market and that point shouldn’t be lost.”
    

            However, she said more work needs to be done to “maximize privacy.”
    

            Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project and a fellow at the NYU School of Law, agreed, saying AirTag’s safeguards “don’t go far enough.”

AirTag could give a nice bump to Apple's growing lineup of smaller stuff 


            “Three days of tracking is more than long enough to create a privacy risk. For those living with their abusers, they might never find out they’re being tracked if their abusers can frequently come within range of the AirTag,” Cahn said. “Similarly, it is helpful that AirTags will alert nearby iPhones to their presence, but those using Android won’t receive an alert if an AirTag is tracking them.” 
    

            Apple said one of the main reasons it spent so much time developing safeguards was the sheer size of its Find My app network. But it’s the AirTags’ reliance on that broader network that creates much of the need for the safeguards in the first place, Cahn said. “That’s because Apple is turning more than a billion iOS devices into a network for tracking AirTags, while Tile will only operate when in range of the small number of people using the Tile app. … The benefits of finding our keys a bit quicker isn’t worth the danger of creating a new global tracking network.”
    

            Although AirTags launched just last week, tech analysts already believe the trackers could be the next big accessory win for Apple. Accessories — from iPhone cases and chargers to tablet keyboards — are a critical part of its revenue growth strategy. 
    

            But as AirTag adoption grows, Ramon Llamas, a director at research firm IDC, echoed that Apple will need to expand its safeguards, as nefarious parties will “find a way to get around privacy issues one way or another.”
    

            “This is a work in progress, especially as the use case continues to evolve,” Llamas said. “For now, AirTags is intended for items.”

            Early in the testing phase of Apple’s M1 chipset, a milestone new product for the company, the processor was installed in a batch of Mac computers and given to staffers working on applications that demanded heavy processing power. It was a pivotal moment: the first time Apple had made its own chip for any of its computers, shifting away from years of using a one-size-fits-all option from Intel.
    

            After multiple teams tested the devices for a few hours while working on tasks, they reported lightning-fast performance but nearly all flagged an apparent problem. The MacBook Pro’s battery indicator, featured on the upper right hand corner of the computers, was broken. It had barely moved despite running power-hungry programs, the company told CNN Business.
    

            The gag, of course, is that the battery indicator was working just fine. The M1 chip was so efficient, according to Apple, that it showed no real strain – one of several major selling points for products that now carry the chip. (Apple promises 20 hours of battery life for its 13-inch M1 MacBook Pro – what it says is the longest battery in any Mac to date). 
    

            Apple also claims the M1 offers the world’s fastest CPU core and fastest integrated graphics in a personal computer, with 3.5 times faster performance, up to 6 times faster graphics processing and 15 times faster machine learning compared to previous-generation Macs. 
    

            On Friday, the company launched its first iMac desktop and iPad Pro line with M1 (the M1 MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro and Mac mini shipped late last year). Early reviews applauded the latest models for unmatched performance speeds, long-lasting batteries and better graphics, all due in part to the processor.
    

            For the iMac specifically, the design is also a technical feat: Because the M1 is so efficient, Apple was able to tuck two compact fans into the computer screen rather than an elaborate, bigger cooling system. The components were ultimately squeezed inside a smaller logic board so the entire computer measures just 11.5 millimeters deep. 
    

            Some PC makers may now be weighing the pros and cons of trying to keep up with the M1. Most rivals, including Samsung, rely on third-party processors from companies such as Intel, AMD, and Qualcomm – options that are manufactured to fit many different computer models. Apple’s tailor-made M1 promises performance far better than competitors. (Intel recently ran performance tests of its Gen Core i7 processor that beat the M1 in certain areas, including Chrome browsing and Microsoft Office 365 tasks. One tech publication, however, called the range “cherry picked” to favor Intel’s chips.)
    

            “The main reason it’ll take other PC vendors a while to catch up to Apple is because most of them don’t control the whole stack of hardware and software,” said Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at market research firm IDC. “This tight integration between the two is Apple’s main advantage.”
    

            Apple is in a rare situation. Its design architects know which products are coming down the pipeline and which features, thermal cooling systems and other components its chips will need to support. It’s also not building and selling chips to different companies for countless products, so it doesn’t have the design considerations or trade-offs of building something more generic.

            CEO Tim Cook alluded to this at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference in June last year. “When we make changes, it’s for one simple but powerful reason: so we can make much better products,” he said. “When we look ahead, we envision some amazing new products that transitioning to our custom silicon will enable us to bring to life.”
    

            Beyond performance, for example, the chip could help enable the development of better cameras, providing more support for image signal processors.
    

            The effort to move to its own silicon – a term referencing the core semiconductor components used in computing devices – has been years in the making. Apple has been acquiring small semiconductor design teams and hiring semiconductor architecture designers for well over a decade.
    

            Apple’s rivals may be more constrained. There are rumors Samsung is working on a Windows notebook with Exynos, an ARM-based chip manufactured by Samsung. But unlike Apple, Ubrani argues that Samsung “wouldn’t have the chops” to make chips comparable to the M1 without input from Microsoft.
    

            Microsoft, meanwhile, is in a particularly tough spot as it has to ensure Windows remains compatible with multiple chip manufacturers and gives users support for legacy apps, he said.
    

            With business already booming, not every PC maker is looking to invest in chasing M1. 
    

            “The majority of PC vendors are actually in a pretty good position right now, with demand remaining strong as we’ve moved into 2021,” said Ishan Dutt, an analyst for market research firm Canalys. The market for PCs, excluding tablets, is expected to grow around 13% this year on top of a stellar 2020, according to Canalys. 
    

            Samsung, for example, has seen its PC business do well in recent quarters due to demand stemming from the pandemic, especially for its Chromebook line. “There isn’t much of a pressing need to do a dramatic overhaul of its portfolio without evidence that it would substantially improve their position in the market,” he said.
    

            Dutt argued Samsung may also not try to touch the M1 because laptops and desktops are a smaller product category for the company, and the costs and potential risks of revamping its lineup are high compared to the upside. “Apple was keen to wean themselves off reliance on Intel in order to reduce some of the friction it was facing and exert greater control over the end-to-end design of its devices,” he said.
    

            Samsung wouldn’t be alone in shying away from the investment. According to Ben Bajarin, principal analyst at Creative Strategies, “Most companies will not make their own silicon as it is extremely expensive.” 
    

            But the cost clearly isn’t stopping Apple. The company previously said in a press release that M1 is the start of a new family of chips designed specifically for the Mac.” Future iterations will serve as an insurance policy for future Apple innovation.

Tim Cook will make first-ever court appearance as Apple CEO in blockbuster Fortnite trial,https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/20/tech/tim-cook-apple-epic-trial/index.html,"Fri, 21 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Tim Cook has fielded questions from Congress about Apple’s market power. Now he’s about to be grilled on it for the first time in federal court.
    

            The iPhone maker’s chief executive is set to take the stand Friday morning as the company’s high-profile antitrust trial with Epic Games nears an end.
    

            At the center of the lawsuit is Fortnite, the hugely popular video game made by Epic that was kicked out of Apple
            
                (AAPL)’s App Store last summer for flouting Apple
            
                (AAPL)’s rules on digital payments by establishing its own system. Apple
            
                (AAPL) gets a 30% cut of many in-app purchases on iOS devices and does not allow alternative payment systems. Fortnite’s removal from the App Store prompted Epic to sue Apple
            
                (AAPL).
    

            Epic accuses Apple of exercising monopolistic control over its “walled garden” iOS operating system, with app makers forced into its onerous restrictions if they want access to hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users. Apple argues there are several other places users can buy apps and that its commission helps the company make its devices better and more secure.

Epic Games and Apple spar over consoles and walled gardens on opening day of trial


            Several executives from both sides have already testified, including Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, and Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow and former longtime head of marketing, who each took the stand earlier this week. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney was the first witness in the trial, which has lasted nearly three weeks and is scheduled to wrap up on Monday. 
    

            For Cook and Apple, there’s more at stake than just this blockbuster court case. Cook’s testimony on Friday is likely to set the tone for Apple’s fight against the growing antitrust pressure it’s facing. Other frenemies such as Spotify and Match Group, the owner of Tinder, have accused the App Store of being anticompetitive. And regulators in several countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom, have launched investigations into Apple’s rules. 
    

            Despite his multiple congressional testimonies and many public appearances and interviews, Cook appears to be preparing extensively for his day in court. He has undergone several hours of mock questioning from former prosecutors to mimic what he might face on the stand, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.
    

            “The thing that’s got to be a little bit scary to Epic is that Tim Cook by reputation is a very persuasive witness,” said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business. “He’s doing what he was hired to do, which is make Apple’s case to the public.”
    

            According to the witness list provided to the court, Cook will talk about “Apple’s corporate values; Apple’s business and operations; development and launch of the App Store; competition faced by Apple.” An Apple representative said Cook will likely expand on his personal views about security and privacy — issues he has previously used to criticize other large tech companies — and their importance to Apple’s product philosophy. 
    

            Cook is expected to pull together and buttress arguments that Apple’s lawyers, experts and other executives have made throughout the trial — that the iPhone’s App Store doesn’t constitute a monopoly. The company says that the 30% commission it takes on transactions within apps isn’t illegal and helps make Apple devices better and more secure, as does the tight control it exercises over the apps on those devices.
    

            In his testimony, Schiller highlighted how much Apple spends on research and development — an estimated $100 billion over the last 15 years — to make product improvements that developers can piggyback off of.
    

            He also sought to push back against Epic’s effort to paint Apple as a monopolist. The gaming company says Apple forces developers to play by burdensome rules such as only using its App Store and in-app payment methods if they want access to more than a billion iPhone and iPad users. (Michael Schmid, Apple’s head of games business development for the App Store, revealed on the stand that Apple has made more than $100 million in commissions from Fortnite.)
    

            Schiller ticked off a list of competitors for both mobile devices and app stores — Google, Samsung, Motorola, Huawei and even gaming consoles such as the Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo Switch. Apple argues that many of them also take a 30% commission and have similar restrictions on outside apps. 
    

            “There are many, many competitors for app distribution,” he said.

            Federighi, the company’s software chief, stressed the importance of Apple’s security protections for its iOS mobile operating system — even criticizing its MacOS computer system in the process. 
    

            Unlike the iPhone, the Mac allows outside app stores and app downloads, a process known as “side-loading.” Epic has repeatedly pointed to and called on Apple to emulate this approach for its mobile devices. But Apple’s lawyers and executives argue the iPhone needs the extra protection because of the sheer number of devices that can be exploited, the fact that smartphones are with users virtually all the time, and hold more sensitive personal data. 
    

            “If you took Mac security techniques and applied them to the iOS ecosystem, with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac,” Federighi said. “We have a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable, and that is much worse than iOS.” 
    

            Cook is not expected to deviate much from those arguments, according to Florian Ederer, a professor of economics at the Yale School of Management. “It is unlikely that any new information or new argument will come from his testimony that has not already been brought to the judge’s attention,” Ederer said. 
    

            “Putting Cook on the stand is essentially the best way for Apple to signal to the judge that it is taking this case seriously,” he added. “If anything, putting Cook on the stand just shows respect for the proceedings.”

Apple TV+ announces Oprah Winfrey and Prince Harry series debut date,https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/10/entertainment/oprah-winfrey-prince-harry-series/index.html,"Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            A highly anticipated multi-part documentary series from co-creators and executive producers Oprah Winfrey and Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, now has a debut date.
    

            Apple TV+ announced Monday that “The Me You Can’t See,” which features stories meant to help lift the veil on the current state of mental health and emotional well-being, will premiere May 21 on Apple TV+. 
    

            According to a news release about the series, “Oprah Winfrey and Prince Harry guide honest discussions about mental health and emotional well-being while opening up about their mental health journeys and struggles,” 
    

            “Featuring high-profile guests, alongside a wide range of people from across the globe living with the challenges of mental health issues and addressing their emotional well-being, the series transcends culture, age, gender, and socioeconomic status to destigmatize a highly misunderstood subject and give hope to viewers who learn that they are not alone.” the release reads. “The producers partnered with 14 accredited and respected experts and organizations from around the world to help shed light on different pathways to treatment.”
    

            “Now more than ever, there is an immediate need to replace the shame surrounding mental health with wisdom, compassion, and honesty,” Winfrey said in a statement. “Our series aims to spark that global conversation.”
    

            “We are born into different lives, brought up in different environments, and as a result are exposed to different experiences. But our shared experience is that we are all human,” Prince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, said. “The majority of us carry some form of unresolved trauma, loss, or grief, which feels – and is – very personal. Yet the last year has shown us that we are all in this together, and my hope is that this series will show there is power in vulnerability, connection in empathy, and strength in honesty.”
    

            The pair made headlines earlier this year for their explosive interview along with Prince Harry’s wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex.


            “The Me You Can’t See” includes Lady Gaga, Glenn Close, San Antonio Spurs’ DeMar DeRozan and others.

            A weeks-long blockbuster antitrust trial between Apple and Epic Games culminated on Monday with the maker of the hit video game Fortnite calling Apple an “overlord” and the iPhone maker suggesting Epic is paving the way for a “scary” future for iOS customers.
    

            After spending days presenting reams of dueling economic analysis and documentary evidence, the two sides landed on Monday where they began: arguing over how Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers should interpret Apple’s role in a sprawling digital economy. The outcome of that analysis could reshape how digital app stores work or uphold Apple’s prime position in its app ecosystem.
    

            In a matter of weeks, Gonzalez Rogers is set to decide whether Apple is an agile innovator that reaped just rewards for building a popular app business, or if it is, as Epic alleges, a monopolist that uses its control over the iOS App Store to illegally harm competition, restrict innovation and keep prices high. 
    

            Wrapping up the three-week trial, which saw top executives including Apple CEO Tim Cook and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney called in for questioning, the judge said Monday she will strive to issue an opinion by mid-August, though it could take longer given the thousands of pages generated by the groundbreaking antitrust case. 
    

            Epic has arguedApple’s walled-garden ecosystem makes it impossible to download iPhone and iPad apps from anywhere but Apple’s own app store, making Apple a monopoly owner. That allegedmonopoly creates opportunities for Apple to impose restrictive terms on iOS app makers, Epic claims, such as requiring a 30% cut of all in-app sales of digital goods and services. (Fortnite was kicked out of Apple’s App Store last summer for flouting Apple’s rules on digital payments by directing players to its own, outside system.)

            On Monday, Epic pleaded with Gonzalez Rogers for an order banning Apple from implementing some of its policies and forcing Apple to allow third-party app stores to compete with its own proprietary app store. Epic also accused Apple of trying to convince the judge it is a “benevolent overlord” of the iOS ecosystem thatshould be allowed to continue to operate without competition “because it’s worked out okay so far.”
    

            “That is not a defense under the antitrust laws,” Epic’s lawyer said. (When Gonzalez Rogers pointed out that Apple couldn’t be “benevolent” while also being anti-competitive, Epic’s lawyer disagreed and said Apple was only “pretending to be a benevolent overlord” and needed to be genuinely tested against competitors.)
    

            By contrast, Apple has urged Gonzalez Rogers to consider the company’s App Store as part of a vibrant, competitive market for video game sales. A procession of prominent executives, culminating with Cook on Friday, argued that Apple’s platform rules protect users and provide security and privacy. And on Monday, its lawyers said that giving Epic whatit wants would be unjustified and unprecedented. 
    

            Gonzalez Rogers offered critical questions to both sides. She challenged Apple on its commission structure, pointing out that “if there was real competition, that number would move and it hasn’t.” Apple argued later that it has reduced commissions several times, such as by creating a discount for small businesses. 
    

            At certain points, the judge implied she was open to finding that Apple had broken the law, musing hypothetically about potential restrictions she could impose on Apple under California law, or considering an analysis that could allow for a finding of anticompetitive conduct by Apple without deciding that it holds a monopoly. 
    

            In a somewhat tense exchange, Gonzalez Rogers grilled Cook after his testimony on Friday, asking why Apple couldn’t give users a choice to get games and content cheaper than it is on the iPhone. She also asked why Apple wouldn’t let apps tell users they could pay for in-app content more cheaply elsewhere online — a point she hit on again Monday.

            She also pushed hard against Epic on Monday, suggesting that what the company was asking her to do was to “change the business model” of Apple. She challenged Epic’s lawyer, Gary Bornstein, to cite an example of a case that had ended in that type of outcome involving private litigants. The attorneys briefly debated the landmark Microsoft antitrust case of the 1990s, the US government’s recent case against Qualcomm and a pending Supreme Court case before ultimately rejecting them as appropriate comparisons. 
    

            “You haven’t told me a single antitrust case where the kind of relief you are requesting has been granted by a court when a private plaintiff comes in,” she said. “It is a pretty significant step that courts haven’t done.” (Bornstein admitted he did not have a perfect analogy onhand and that the judge faces “a pretty unique situation.”)
    

            By expressing reservations about precedent, Gonzalez Rogers opened the door to arguments by Apple that giving into Epic’s requests would represent a serious break from history. 
    

            “If that is scary for Apple’s iOS customers … and for this court, that is simply a consequence of what Epic is asking for,” said Apple’s lawyer, Richard Doren. In contrast, Epic claimed that Apple is attempting to “scare the court.” 
    

            But at other times, Gonzalez Rogers appeared to relish her role on the cutting edge of the law. 
    

            “They don’t call us the Wild West for nothing,” she joked.

Apple parts ways with newly hired ex-Facebook employee after workers cite 'misogynistic' writing,https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/13/tech/apple-antonio-garcia-martinez/index.html,"Thu, 13 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"Markets

            Apple parted ways with a new employee this week after thousands of workers petitioned the company to investigate how it hired the man, who had previously published an autobiography they said contains misogynistic statements.
    

            Antonio García Martínez, formerly a product manager for ad targeting at Facebook as well as the author of the 2016 autobiography “Chaos Monkeys: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley,” joined Apple’s ads team in April, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
    

            García Martínez’s book chronicles his life in the San Francisco Bay Area’s tech scene from 2010 to 2014. He began his career as a quantitative strategist for Goldman Sachs before leaving for Silicon Valley, where he eventually started an ad-tech startup, AdGrok, which he later sold to Twitter. He worked as a product manager at Facebook between 2011 and 2013. In addition to his book, García Martínez has written for publications including Wired.
    

            On Monday, Business Insider noted García Martínez’s new position, citing his LinkedIn profile. By Tuesday evening, some Apple employees began circulating an internal “letter of concern,” citing several of García Martínez’s passages in “Chaos Monkeys” as problematic. The employees argued, in a letter viewed by CNN Business, that the passages are in direct opposition to Apple’s commitment to inclusion.
    

            To illustrate their point, the letter — which was first reported on by tech news site The Verge on Wednesday after it accumulated more than 2,000 employees’ signatures — included excerpts from his writing.
    

            “Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of s**t,” read a sentence in one passage from “Chaos Monkeys.” It continued, “They have their self-regarding entitlement feminism, and ceaselessly vaunt their independence, but the reality is, come the epidemic plague or foreign invasion, they’d become precisely the sort of useless baggage you’d trade for a box of shotgun shells or a jerry can of diesel.”
    

            Another book excerpt cited in the letter detailed startup funding, and included this sentence: “To make an analogy, a capped note is like having to seduce five women one after the other, while an equity round is having to convince five women to do a sixsome with you.”
    

            “We are profoundly distraught by what this hire means for Apple’s commitment to its inclusion goals, as well as its real and immediate impact on those working near Mr. García Martínez. It calls into question parts of our system of inclusion at Apple, including hiring panels, background checks, and our process to ensure our existing culture of inclusion is strong enough to withstand individuals who don’t share our inclusive values,” read the letter. 
    

            It also demanded the company investigate how García Martínez’s “published views on women and people of color were missed or ignored” in the hiring process and come up with a “clear plan of action to prevent this from happening again.”
    

            “Given Mr. García Martínez’s history of publishing overtly racist and sexist remarks about his former colleagues, we are concerned that his presence at Apple will contribute to an unsafe working environment for our colleagues who are at risk of public harassment and private bullying,” the letter also said.
    

            García Martínez did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN Business, though he did appear to view a direct message sent to his verified Twitter profile.
    

            CNN Business (then known as CNN Money) reviewed “Chaos Monkeys” in June 2016, saying at the time that it reads as if it’s four years worth of “Medium posts from a scorned man.” 
    

            While employees at tech companies like Google and Facebook have on occasion in recent years been publicly vocal about issues pertaining to internal culture, this episode has been a rare display of dissent among Apple’s workforce spilling into view. Numerous Apple employees took to Twitter on Wednesday to communicate openly about it, underscoring how important some felt it was for the company to address the situation.
    

            “The reason I took to this letter as opposed to some other method is while I do trust in Apple’s culture and my leadership to do the right thing this was still starkly contradictory to that trust and those feelings,” Cher, an Apple engineer who asked that her last name be withheld for privacy reasons, told CNN Business. 
    

            By Wednesday night, Apple confirmed to CNN Business that García Martínez no longer works at Apple.
    

            “At Apple, we have always strived to create an inclusive, welcoming workplace where everyone is respected and accepted. Behavior that demeans or discriminates against people for who they are has no place here,” an Apple spokesman said.

            Hot Stocks 




            Apple kicked off its annual developers conference on Monday by unveiling new features on iOS 15 that cater to our lives as the world begins to emerge from the pandemic, including updates to video calls on FaceTime and digital keys in Apple Wallet. 
    

            On FaceTime, Apple
            
                (AAPL) will offer new options to let users watch movies or listen to music together during a call. It is also introducing a new grid view to better broadcast every face on a call. Android and Windows users will now also be able to join FaceTime calls.
    

            “We’ve all found ourselves using video calling for just about everything,” Craig Federighi, Apple’s SVP of software engineering, said during the virtual keynote presentation on Monday. 
    

            Apple is also introducing updates to its mobile wallet that will allow users to unlock everything from their home to their hotel room with digital keys in the app. 
    

            “You can never leave home without your keys, so we are continuing to add keys to wallet and making them even better,” said Jennifer Bailey, VP of internet services and Apple Pay, citing recent additions such as car keys to unlock a vehicle from your iPhone. BMW and others will ship cars with this feature starting later this year, she said.
    

            The company will also make it possible to store identity cards in Apple Wallet. Starting this fall, users can scan their driver’s license or ID into the wallet app — in participating states — where it will be stored in an encrypted form. Bailey said Apple is working with the TSA to use that digital ID at airport security checkpoints.
    

            The features were announced during the keynoteat Apple’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, a multi-day event that’s typically heavy on software news. iOS 15 will be available to the general public in the fall. 
    

            Like many tech companies, Apple and its products became even more central to our lives during the pandemic as countless households were forced to live and work more behind screens. Apple’s announcements on Monday hinted at how the company hopes to remain a key part of our lives even as many resume working and socializing outside the home. 
    

            For people still frequently glued to their screens, Apple introduced a new iOS feature called “Focus” that will let users select what kinds of notifications they want to receive, and from whom, at certain times of day. For example, a user can set their phone on “work” mode, and opt to only receive notifications from coworkers, emails and Slack messages. When other notifications are turned off, users can set a “do not disturb” auto-reply for messages. 
    

            “With Focus, you can carve out time in your day for work and personal life,” Federighi said. 
    

            On iMessage, Apple wants to make it easier for users to keep track of the photos, links and other content they’ve been sent. Apps including Photos, Safari and Apple Music will now include a “shared with you folder” to highlight content that has been sent through messages. 
    

            Beyond new gadgets and the introduction of iOS 15, WWDC is also an opportunity for Apple to address its developer community in the midst of two major recent spats with app makers — a contentious legal battle with Fortnite-maker Epic Games over Apple’s App Store fees and a feud with Facebook
            
                (FB) over Apple’s new app-tracking privacy policy.
    

            The company reminded developers that the App Store now has 600 million weekly visitors from 175 countries and regions, and said it has paid more than $230 billion to developers since the App Store launched in 2008. 
    

            As expected, Apple doubled down on its privacy focus during the keynote.
    

            “At Apple, we believe privacy is a fundamental human right,” Federighi said, referencing recently implemented features such as app nutrition labels. “We don’t think you should have to make a tradeoff between great features and privacy. We believe you deserve both.” 
    

            The company introduced a variety of new security features, including one called “mail privacy protection.” The email app on Apple devices will now hide users’ IP addresses and their location, so companies sending emails can’t link that information to users’ other online activity. Additionally, senders can’t see if or when users open their email.
    

            Siri is getting a privacy update, too. The virtual assistant app will now process audio right on your device, rather than sending commands to a server, to alleviate concerns about unwanted audio listening by third parties. In 2019, Apple apologized for letting contractors listen to commands that users give to Siri. The change will also make Siri’s response time faster, Apple executives said. 
    

            Subscribers of iCloud+ can take advantage of additional new privacy features. They include Safari “private relay,” which encrypts the traffic leaving a user’s device, so no third parties (including Apple) can intercept and read what they’re searching for. And the “hide my email” feature will let subscribers input a randomly generated email when signing up for an account on a new website that will forward messages to their inbox. This will reduce the number of companies that have access to users’ direct email addresses. 
    

            These privacy changes will likely “cause further consternation among those companies’ dependent on user data for tracking, advertising and monetisation,” CCS Insight Chief Analyst Ben Wood said in an email.
    

            While Apple did not make any new hardware announcements on Monday, it did introduce software updates to refresh products like the iPad and AirPods. 
    

            iPad OS 15 updates will make it easier for users to work on the go. Those who own the device will soonbe able to place widgets among the apps on their home screen, such as widgets for contacts or Apple TV, including new, larger formats made for the iPad’s display. 
    

            A new “multitasking” feature on iPad will let users work on two apps at the same time using a split view, and a simple swiping mechanism to switch between apps on split view. 
    

            The company also announced system-wide translation for iPad OS, as well as for iOS and Mac OS. Users can right-click on text on any app — including text selected from a photo — and translate it. An “auto translate” feature can listen when you talk to your iPad and translate that speech. 
    

            Apple also introduced a new feature on AirPods called “conversation boost” that is designed to help people who are hard of hearing. The tool focuses a user’s AirPods Pro on the person talking in front of them, making it easier to hear in a face to face conversation. It can also reduce the amount of ambient noise.
    

            And users will be able tofind their AirPods Pro and AirPods Max with Apple’s bluetooth “Find My” network. If users think their missing AirPods are somewhere nearby, they can also select “play sound” on the Find My app and the AirPods will make a chirping sound —  all useful as people get back to living life outside their homes.

            There’s a cloud hanging over Apple’s big annual developer event this week: many app developers aren’t very happy with the company right now. 
    

            For more than a decade, Apple
            
                (AAPL) app developers have subjected themselves to stringent payment restrictions, rigorous app approval processes and hefty 30% commissions on in-app transactions, all with the promise of reaching a large and growing audience of iPhone and iPad owners.

            But Apple’s latest Worldwide Developer Conference, which mainly focuses on software updates, kicked off Monday after months of tensions — and a high-profile trial — over the restrictions its App Store forces developers to adhere to. Antitrust regulators and lawmakers in several countries including the United States are now examining how the company runs the App Store. And app makers are speaking out, too.
    

            On Monday, minutes before WWDC kicked off, Facebook
            
                (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has sparred with Apple frequently, announced that the social network would not take a cut from content creators on its platform for at least the next 18 months. In the process, he took a swipe at Apple.
    

            “To help more creators make a living on our platforms, we’re going to keep paid online events, fan subscriptions, badges, and our upcoming independent news products free for creators until 2023,” Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post. “And when we do introduce a revenue share, it will be less than the 30% that Apple and others take.”
    

            Zuckerberg also said Facebook will launch a “payout interface” to help creators see how much money they’re losing to fees from companies such as Apple and Google. 
    

            Days earlier, Marco Arment, a prominent Apple developer behind the podcast app Overcast and the founder of online bookmarking service Instapaper, slammed the company’s leadership in a blog post for trying to extract money from developers even as Apple earns enormous profits from its hardware sales.
    

            “But to bully and gaslight developers into thinking that we need to be kissing Apple’s feet for permitting us to add billions of dollars of value to their platform is not only greedy, stingy, and morally reprehensible, but deeply insulting,” he said. 
    

            The criticisms hit at the underlying power dynamic between Apple and its developer community: developers depend on Apple to reach users but Apple depends on developers to build apps that help attract users. 
    

            As Arment put it: “Without our apps, the iPhone has little value to most of its customers today.” 
    

            The commissions Apple charges developers offering in-app purchases have long been controversial and under scrutiny, but those tensions came to a head recently when Epic Games, the maker of the popular video game Fortnite, faced off against Apple in federal court. 
    

            Epic accuses Apple of exercising monopolistic control over its “walled garden” iOS operating system, alleging that app makers are forced into onerous restrictions if they want access to hundreds of millions of iPhone and iPad users. Apple argues there are several other places users can buy apps and that its commission helps the company make its devices better and more secure. A verdict in the trial, which concluded on May 24, is expected in the coming months.
    

            Epic’s lawsuit brought to the fore many of the issues developers have with Apple, and those tensions are still simmering in the backdrop of this week’s WWDC. 
    

            David Baszucki, the CEO of Roblox, another game platform that was mentioned multiple times during the Apple-Epic trial, expressed support for lowering appcommissions in an interview with Axios published on the eve of WWDC. 
    

            “It’s fair to say we want to give as much money back to developers,” Baszucki said, noting his company has “great relationships” with Apple and other app store operators. “If those store fees were to change, a majority of that we would give back to the creator community.”
    

            Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the company touted its support for developers several times during the Epic trial — including the $50 million it said it spends to put on WWDC.
    

            “We turn the place upside down for developers,” CEO Tim Cook said on the stand. But he also acknowledged that Apple makes decisions “in the best interests of the user” and “sometimes there’s a conflict between what the developer may want and what the user may want.”
    

            As it unveiled new software features for users and developers on Monday, Apple reminded them of the benefits of its ecosystem. The App Store now has 600 million weekly visitors from 175 countries and regions, the company said, adding that it has paid more than $230 billion to developers since the App Store launched in 2008. 
    

            In what is perceived as a possible reaction to accusations that its iOS ecosystem is closed and restrictive, Apple announced it will make one of its popular products, video calling service FaceTime, accessible to users of rival platforms Android and Windows. 
    

            “Apple at WWDC is walking a tightrope around convincing software developers to double down on its platform while… collecting its 30% fee,” Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, told CNN Business.
    

            Even as Apple courts developers at this week’s event, it’s also doubling down on privacy protections with the potential to aggravate some developers and companies.

            During the keynote Monday, Apple announced several new controls for users. Those include “mail privacy protection,” which gives users the ability to hide their IP addresses and location from companies, and “hide my email,” which generates a random email address to sign up for new websites so companies don’t have users’ real email addresses. Another feature, called “app privacy report,” shows users each time an app accesses their phone’s location, contacts, camera or microphone as well as all the third-party websites that app is sharing their data with. 
    

            Apple previously rolled out an App Tracking Transparency feature which requires iPhone apps to ask users for permission to track their behavior and sell their personal data. Facebook, which makes almost all of its revenue from advertising, warned investors in August that Apple’s software changes could hurt its business and has been particularly outspoken against it.
    

            The latest privacy changes will likely “cause further consternation among those companies’ dependent on user data for tracking, advertising and monetisation,” CCS Insight Chief Analyst Ben Wood said in an email after Monday’s keynote.
    

            But Apple is sticking to its guns, and betting that superior privacy and security features make its devices worth paying for, developing for and paying commissions on.
    

            “We don’t think you should have to make a tradeoff between great features and privacy,” Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, said during the keynote. “We believe you deserve both.”

"Stephen King adapts his own book in 'Lisey's Story,' with disappointing results",https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/03/entertainment/liseys-story-review/index.html,"Thu, 03 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            Stephen King’s usual policy of selling the rights to his books and washing his hands of the results goes out the window in “Lisey’s Story,” which the prolific author adapted himself. But the Apple TV+ limited series lands in the shallow end of the King cinematic pool, with a convoluted story that mostly squanders its big-name cast.
    

            The Lisey of the title is played by Julianne Moore, who watched her husband Scott Landon (Clive Owen), a famous novelist, be murdered right in front of her. But Lisey’s reluctance to part with his unpublished works irks an academic (“This is Us’” Ron Cephas Jones) who yearns to get his hands on them, and leads to unleashing a crazed fan (Dane DeHaan) to pursue the manuscripts.
    

            Still, that only scratches the surface of the dense and time-hopping narrative, since Scott keeps appearing to Lisey, dispensing vague advice and cryptic clues about what she’ll need to deal with the threats she faces, exchanges that unfold heavily garnished by surreal and supernatural imagery.
    

            Adding to the “ick” factor, Lisey’s catatonic, institutionalized sister (Joan Allen) – who is prone to cutting herself – figures into the larger plot, as do pretty gruesome levels of violence and the occasional sequence involving characters vomiting great torrents of water.
    

            At its core, King explores themes about the price of fame, extreme fandom and foremost the processes of love, loss and grief, with glimpses of Lisey and Scott’s grand romance as the eight episodes – directed entirely by Chilean director Pablo Larraín – jump back and forth in time.
    

            King’s involvement, however, hasn’t fixed what has ailed some past adaptations. Instead, the author winds up muddling and muddying that defies simple genre classification – “macabre” would be the operative term – in too-drawn-out fashion, as Lisey slowly discovers the terrible secrets from Scott’s past.
    

            Despite his uneven screen track record, the combination of King’s loyal fans, the need for fresh content and the box-office success of the latest “It” iterations have fueled a cinematic onslaught of his work, old and new. Recent TV productions alone include HBO’s riveting “The Outsider” and the less-satisfying Paramount+ remake of “The Stand” last year, as well as the upcoming “Chapelwaite” for Epix.
    

            Like a well-traveled transit line, if you miss a King production, never fear, another will be along shortly. And the big names notwithstanding, if you bypass the stop for “Lisey’s Story,” you won’t have missed much.
    

“Lisey’s Story” premieres June 4 on Apple TV+.

"Trump Justice Department subpoenaed Apple for data from House Intelligence Committee Democrats, sources say",https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/10/politics/house-intelligence-committee-apple-data-trump-justice-department-doj/index.html,"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            Prosecutors in the Trump administration Justice Department subpoenaed Apple for data from the accounts of House Intelligence Committee Democrats – including Chairman Adam Schiff – along with their staff and family members as part of a leak investigation, an Intelligence Committee official and a source familiar with the matter confirmed to CNN. 
    

            Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, another Democrat on the committee, told CNN’s Don Lemon on Thursday evening that he was notified that his data had been seized as part of the probe as well. 
    

            The prosecutors, the New York Times first reported, were looking for the sources behind news stories about contacts between Russia and Trump associates. 
    

            The leak hunt began with the FBI sending a subpoena to Apple in February 2018, which included a gag order, seeking metadata on more than 100 accounts as part of an investigation into the disclosure of classified information, the person familiar with the matter said. 
    

            The gag order was renewed three times before it expired this year and Apple notified the customers. The House Intelligence Committee determined that along with members of the panel and staff, the dragnet collected the records of family members, including at least one minor, the person said. 
    

            Records seized included those from staff members who had nothing to do with issues related to Russia or former FBI Director James Comey, including Schiff’s personal office staff, a House Intelligence Committee source told CNN.
    

            Democratic committee leadership is relying on self-reporting to know who has been impacted at this point – both members and staff, the source said. 
    

            Swalwell confirmed to CNN that records of family members and a minor had been obtained.
    

            “I do know that to be true,” he told Lemon. “And I believe they were targeted punitively, not for any reason in law but because Donald Trump identified Chairman Schiff and members of the committee as an enemy of his.”
    

            Those subject to subpoenas were notified in May by Apple that the Justice Department had issued grand jury subpoenas in February 2018 for their information, the House Intelligence Committee official said. 
    

            “The Committee has continued to seek additional information, but the Department has not been forthcoming in a timely manner, including on questions such as whether the investigation was properly predicated and whether it only targeted Democrats,” the committee official told CNN.
    

            At this point, legislative affairs staffers are the only Justice Department staff who have communicated with the Intelligence Committee, according to the committee source. 
    

            News of the subpoenas marks just the latest disclosure about the Trump administration’s heavy-handed tactics toward leak investigations. The development follows a series of revelations about the Justice Department secretly obtaining records from journalists, including CNN’s Barbara Starr, as well as reporters from The Washington Post and other news organizations. 
    

            And while the data didn’t tie the committee to the leaks during then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ tenure, William Barr moved a prosecutor from New Jersey to the main Justice Department to work on the Schiff-related case and others when he became attorney general the following year, three people with knowledge of his work told the Times. 
    

            A spokesperson for Justice Department, a representative for Apple and Barr declined to comment to the Times. 
    

            In a statement Thursday evening, Schiff said, “The politicization of the Department and the attacks on the rule of law are among the most dangerous assaults on our democracy carried out by the former President. Though we were informed by the Department in May that this investigation is closed, I believe more answers are needed, which is why I believe the Inspector General should investigate this and other cases that suggest the weaponization of law enforcement by a corrupt president.”
    

            Asked by CNN’s Chris Cuomo later Thursday about the number of accounts seized, Schiff said he was not certain of the number but posited, “It wouldn’t surprise me if it was an extraordinary number because just the circle that I am aware of was so overbroad that they clearly were not discriminating. They were simply fishing.”
    

            That message was echoed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who called the development “harrowing.”
    

            “These actions appear to be yet another egregious assault on our democracy waged by the former president,” Pelosi said in a statement. 
    

            “I support Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff’s call for an investigation into this situation and other acts of the weaponization of law enforcement by the former president. Transparency is essential.”

            Jimmy Lai fled mainland China more than 60 years ago, smuggling himself into Hong Kong on a fishing boat at age 12 to escape the chaos of the Communist Party. This week, Beijing finally caught up with him, after a law it had imposed on Hong Kong last year was used to take down his pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily.


            The iconic Hong Kong tabloid Lai founded shuttered Thursday due to an untenable environment in which its journalists had been arrested under the vaguely worded National Security Law and assets had been frozen, parent company Next Media has said. Lai, now in his mid-70s, and five of the paper’s top editors and executives have also been arrested under the sweeping law for alleged collusion with foreign forces, ostensibly over articles they wrote and interviews Lai gave with media outlets calling for sanctions on Hong Kong.
    

            News of Apple Daily’s closure prompted an outpouring of emotion outside its offices Wednesday night, where one longtime Hong Kong journalist tearfully told CNN the closure marked the end of press freedom in the once-autonomous city.
    

            “Apple Daily has always been a symbolic publication for us to show that Hong Kong’s press freedoms still exist,” she told CNN’s Lauren Lau as the crowd clapped and shouted in support of the newspaper. “We don’t agree with all the things they report … but that’s a matter of professional discussion, and I respect many of my peers, journalists, friends. They did a lot of good stories, they always speak out and they are there to ask the most pressing questions. This is why they are now being targeted by the government.” 
    

As CNN’s Jenni Marsh writes, Apple Daily’s tabloid sensibilities drove a paparazzi culture in the city, and at times attracted ire for its reporting methods. But it also tracked the wealth of mainland officials and their families in Hong Kong, and devoted ample resources to holding those in power to account. While other outlets avoided openly criticizing China’s ruling Communist Party, Apple Daily continued poking the bear. When a mass pro-democracy movement erupted in 2019, its front pages urged readers to attend huge marches, and it printed anti-government posters for them to carry.
    

            All that was too much for Beijing on Chinese soil. In June 2020, as pandemic restrictions thwarted the ability of Hong Kongers to protest, China passed the law under which Lai and many pro-democracy politicians and activists have been arrested. Until this week, Apple Daily was the last major voice of the pro-democracy camp still at large.
    

            US President Joe Biden on Thursday described the Apple Daily closure as “a sad day for media freedom in Hong Kong and around the world.”
    

            “Intensifying repression by Beijing has reached such a level that Apple Daily, a much-needed bastion of independent journalism in Hong Kong, has now ceased publishing. Through arrests, threats, and forcing through a National Security Law that penalizes free speech, Beijing has insisted on wielding its power to suppress independent media and silence dissenting views,” he said in a statement. 
    

            “People in Hong Kong have the right to freedom of the press. Instead, Beijing is denying basic liberties and assaulting Hong Kong’s autonomy and democratic institutions and processes, inconsistent with its international obligations. The United States will not waver in our support of people in Hong Kong and all those who stand up for the basic freedoms all people deserve,” he also said.
    

            Joe Biden may be the most publicly devout President since Jimmy Carter. 
    

            Every weekend, his motorcade leaves the White House or his home in Delaware for Biden to attend Mass in a Roman Catholic church. When he was in England for the G7 summit, he surprised worshippers by showing up in a local pew. The second Catholic President, after John Kennedy, Biden has said his faith anchors him following a string of personal tragedies, and last year – after then-President Donald Trump claimed Biden’s election would “hurt God” – said that faith was “the bedrock foundation of my life.”  
    

            So it must be a personal trial for Biden to know that conservative Catholic bishops in the US are pushing a plan to take away his right to receive Communion, due to his support for abortion rights. Designed to affect all Catholic politicians who support abortion, the doctrinal changes they are advocating will, however, have limited effect – bishops are free to make their own calls in their local dioceses.
    

            Though he personally opposes abortion, Biden says he would not impose his views on women who do not share his religion or on believers of other faiths. Support for a woman’s right to choose what happens to her body is a firmly embedded value in the Democratic coalition. Republicans largely oppose abortion, and the anti-abortion movement is mounting multiple court challenges to abortion rights that may end up in the Supreme Court. 
    

            The President has said that the Church’s attitude to Communion is a private matter that he won’t discuss in public. But the American bishops’ proposed policy changes have raised some questions about consistency: The death penalty contradicts Roman Catholic teachings, for example, but there was no movement in the Church to prevent Trump Attorney General William Barr, who follows the faith, from receiving Communion after he ordered the Justice Department to resume federal executions. 
    

            Such contradictions explain why more liberal faith groups like Catholics for Choice are condemning the use of Communion as a “weapon of punishment,” and accuse bishops of refusing to wrestle with the complexities of sexuality and reproduction.

            Hong Kong police declared the Apple Daily newspaper office a crime scene Thursday, after 500 officers descended on the premises to arrest executives and top editors and seize journalistic materials under the city’s national security law. 
    

            Apple Daily said Thursday that the company’s CEO Cheung Kim Hung, COO Chow Tat Kuen and chief editor Ryan Law, along with the deputy chief editor and online editor were all arrested and accused of colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security — a provision of the sweeping legislation introduced last year that banned sedition, secession and subversion against Beijing.
    

            “This case involves a conspiracy,” Hong Kong Security Secretary John Lee told reporters at a press conference Thursday, adding that the police raid was targeted at those who use journalism as a “tool to endanger national security.”
    

            Senior superintendent Steve Li, of the police’s national security department, said 18 million Hong Kong dollars ($2.3 million) in assets related to the newspaper had been frozen. The assets are owned by three companies: Apple Daily, Apple Publishing & A.D. Internet Limited. 
    

            The publication live-streamed the early morning raid on its Facebook page, showing police asking staff  to show proof of identity, and blocking them from returning to their desks.
    

            The Hong Kong government confirmed Thursday that it had arrested five “directors of a company” on suspicion of violating the national security law and that officers had obtained a search warrant which gave officers the power to seize journalist material.
    

            After the initial raid, Li said Apple Daily’s headquarters was now a crime scene, and that officers had confiscated electronic devices, such as mobile phones, computers and laptops. In images published online by Apple Daily, police officers could be seen examining computers at the office.
    

            He said police were investigating Apple Daily for its earlier attempts to “colluding with foreign forces and external elements to endanger national security.” Li said that since 2019 Apple Daily had published articles calling on foreign countries to sanction the Chinese and Hong Kong governments.
    

            Last year, the deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council said the national security law, which came into effect on June 30, would not be retroactive.
    

            Li also urged the public not to repost the content. “If you have no real reason to share these types of articles, I would advise everyone not to,” Li warned. 
    

            “The government is raiding Apple Daily because they can’t shut it down by economic pressure,” Mark Simon, managing director of the private holdings of newspaper’s controversial founder Jimmy Lai, told CNN Business. “So that means we have 130 cops in our newsroom vacuuming up documents.”
    

            The arrests and probe are the latest step in an escalating crackdown against the provocative, anti-Beijing tabloid, which has become the poster child in Hong Kong for media freedom in what many analysts argue is an increasingly hostile landscape for the industry.

Hong Kong has fined a journalist for ticking a box. That shows the city's media freedoms are in jeopardy


            Media mogul Lai — who for decades has been a symbol of the city’s tensions with mainland China — already faces charges under the national security law and is currently serving jail sentences for his role in unauthorized assemblies dating from the 2019 pro-democracy protests. 
    

            Li said that Thursday’s operation was not targeting the press, but one individual organization that violated the national security law, saying the Hong Kong government  values press freedom. 
    

            Carrie Lam, the city’s leader, said after the passage of the Beijing-imposed national security law that Hong Kong people should still be able to enjoy freedom of speech and press. The government has also told CNN Business in the past that it is “firmly committed to protecting and respecting the freedom of the press.” 
    

            Lee, the security secretary, sought to quell concerns about press freedoms in the city on Thursday, saying that the probe was targeted at actions that were “not normal journalistic work.”
    

            “Please understand that our actions are not targeting journalistic work,” he added. ‘We target perpetrators who use journalistic work as a tool to endanger acts of national security.”
    

            Press freedoms are a fundamental right guaranteed by Hong Kong’s Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution. But experts have worried about the usage of the national security law, and there have been indications of pressures on other media in the city. Earlier this year, a freelance producer working with public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) was convicted and fined for violating a traffic ordinance — a convoluted charge connected to her reporting on a pivotal event during the height of the 2019 protests. 
    

            A recent ranking of worldwide press freedoms, meanwhile, indicates that the environment in Hong Kong has deteriorated. The international watchdog Reporters Without Borders — which qualifies such freedoms based on data on abuse and acts of violence against journalists along with a questionnaire to experts — ranked Hong Kong 80 out of 180 countries for press freedom, down from 18 out of 138 in 2002.

            One year was all it took for a Beijing-imposedNational Security Law to take downHong Kong’s largest and loudest pro-democracy newspaper.
    

            Next Media announced Wednesdaythat Apple Daily, its flagship tabloid, would publish its final copy Thursday due to an untenable environment in which its journalists had been arrested and millions of dollars in assets had been frozen. Its digital platform will cease operations on the same day, the company said in a statement. 
    

            The news sent a deep chill through Hong Kong’s media industry and undermined government claims the new legislation would not diminish press freedom. 
    

            Last year, China’s ruling Communist Party moved to bring Hong Kong in line with its authoritarian ruleby bypassing the city’s legislature to implement thesecurity law.It punishes anything the authorities deem to be subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. 
    

            While city leader Carrie Lam saidback then thatpress freedoms would still be protected, Apple Daily staffers say they knew it was only a matter of time before they were targeted.

Hong Kong's first trial under new national security law begins without a jury


            “But it still came as a shock when it happened,” said one journalist at the publication, who asked to remain anonymous out of security fears. 
    

            Since the law took effect, Apple Daily has been crippled bit by bit. Founder Jimmy Lai — already in jailfor attending a pro-democracy rally — has been arrested and charged with colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security. Five of the newspaper’s top editors and executives have been accused of the same crime,apparently for using articles to call for foreign governments to sanction Hong Kong.  
    

            Hundreds of police officers have twice raided the publication’s newsroom, most recently seizing computers and materials — an alarming development for journalists and their sources in an increasingly sensitive environment. Several Apple Daily journalists had already quit before this month, saying the rewards of their work no longer outweighed the risk of imprisonment.  
    

            Even as official pressure piled on the newspaper, public supportsurged.Last Friday, after the arrest of its top editors, Apple Daily printed 500,000 copies which sold out.
    

            That wasn’t enough to counter a financial squeezebrought on by Hong Kong authorities. While Next Media told investors ithad enough money to last 18 months from April, in recent days the paper’s bank accounts had been frozen.  
    

            On Wednesday, as the board met to discuss the paper’s future, police officers again descended on the newsroom arresting another journalist. Hours later, the paper announced that after 26 years on newsstands, it would close its doors.
    

            “A woman sent me a note a few days ago saying without Apple Daily she just doesn’t feel as safe as she used to with a free press as the protector of society,” said Mark Simon, one of Lai’s top advisers.
    

            “They’re coming for everyone else soon.”
    

            Jimmy Lai founded Apple Daily in 1995, channeling the wealth he’d accumulated as a textile tycoon into the Next Digital publishing operation. The mission of its centerpiece title, Apple Daily, was always clear: to criticize the Communist Party that Lai had fled mainland China from as a child.
    

            The newspaper was a sensation, and its tabloid sensibilities quickly made it a market leader, giving Lai a huge platform to influence opinion in Hong Kong. The paper drove a paparazzi culture in the city, and at times attracted ire for its reporting methods. But it also tracked the wealth of mainland officials and their families in Hong Kong, and devoted ample resources to holding those in power to account.  
    

An advertisement introducing the newspaper to the world made it clear Jimmy Lai knew the Apple Daily made him a target. 


            Beijing’s growing economic influence in the early 2000s meant that other outlets often avoided openly criticizing the Communist Party, mindful of commercial implications. Lai didn’t care. Apple Daily continued poking the bear, even if that meantmajor Hong Kong corporations such as Cathay Pacific or CK Hutchison Holdings never advertised with the publication.
    

            The newspaper didn’t back down as the Communist Party under President Xi Jinping grew increasingly intolerant to anydissent — especiallyin its disputed or semi-autonomous territories such as Hong Kong, which after being handed back to China from Britain in 1997 was promised its own system of governance for 50 years. 
    

            That two-track setup led to a disconnect between how Hong Kongers expected to be governed and Beijing’s desire to control the city.  
    

            Lai was a key figure in a series of 2014 protests dubbed the Umbrella movement, which brought central Hong Kong to a standstill for months. His paper became a symbol of the opposition to Beijing’s plans for how Hong Kong’s leader would be selected.
    

            When mass unrest erupted again in 2019, this time over a bill proposing extradition to China, Apple Daily’s front pages urged readers to attend huge marches, and printed anti-government posters for them to carry.
    

            Anger in the city that yearturned into the most serious violence Hong Kong had seen in decades: The city’s legislature was sacked, a dramatic 12-day siege unfolded at a university and the international airport was shut down, twice. 
    

            All that was too much for Beijing on Chinese soil. In June2020,as pandemic restrictions thwarted the ability of Hong Kongers to protest, China passed the National Security Law.
    

            In the 12 months since, nearly all pro-democracy politicians have either been jailed or have fled the territory. Apple Daily was the last major voice of the pro-democracy camp still at large.
    

            Apple Daily divided opinion in Hong Kong. It wasloved by those who shared its liberal values and loathed by conservatives who accused it of causing chaos.
    

            Still,its death has caused alarm about freedom of press in Hong Kong. On Tuesday, city leaderLam triedto dismiss those fears, saying that the police probe into Apple Daily was “unrelated to normal journalist work.” 
    

            Michael J. Abramowitz, president of NGO Freedom House railed against that sentiment. 
    

            “Treating independent, fact-based journalism as a threat to national security is an unacceptable attack on press freedom and comes amid a wider crackdown on freedom of expression and freedom of assembly in Hong Kong,” he said.  
    

            It is now unclear how Hong Kong’smini-constitution — the Basic Law, which guarantees freedom of expression and the media — will operate alongside a national security law that sets increasingly narrower parameters for journalistic work.  
    

            The Apple Daily’s closure follows a slew of attacks on pressfreedom. Thecity’s police chief recently proposed an anti-fake news law; a journalist was convicted for an administrative error when investigating alleged police wrongdoing; and public broadcaster RTHK has seen its coverage squeezed.

            At the same time, there has been a clampdown on broader civil liberties. This year, Hong Kong’s annual Tiananmen Square vigil was not permitted to go ahead, ostensibly because of Covid restrictions, and potential attendees threatened with up to 12 months in jail.
    

            In a sign of Hong Kong’s decreasing tolerance for political positions that diverge from those of Beijing, Taiwan announced it will remove all non-local staff from its office in the city. Taipei accused the Hong Kong government of demanding its Taiwanese staff sign a document acknowledging Beijing’s claim over the self-governing island as a prerequisite for visa renewals.  
    

            As newsstands open next week, they will be absent of the apple-bearing masthead that has been a staple for decades. Jimmy Lai remains in jail with no ability to advocate for the paper founded. In his mid-70s, it is debatable whether he will ever walk free in Hong Kong again.

            “I never would have imagined it would come to this.” said Andrea Lo, a freelance journalist in Hong Kong. “Apple Daily is a huge part of everyday life for us as Hong Kongers, but not just because it has consistently been the biggest champion of the voice of the people. All of us find a lot of value in its coverage on everything from the pro-democracy protests, to real-time reports on incidents around Hong Kong.”  
    

            On Wednesday, grieving readers gathered outside the newspaper’s headquarters, holding placards, and bearing cards and flowers. 
    

            “I think people will miss the Apple Daily as a platform where they could speak freely and be critical of the government and Beijing,” said the Apple Daily newsroom staffer. 
    

            “Maybe some other media will become the substitute for us,” he added, doubtfully.

Apple informed former White House counsel Don McGahn and wife that their records were sought by DOJ in 2018,https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/13/politics/don-mcgahn-justice-department-apple-account-records/index.html,"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNN,"
            Former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn and his wife received disclosures from Apple last month that their account records were sought by the Justice Department in February 2018, while McGahn was still the top lawyer representing the presidency, according to a person familiar. 
    

The New York Times first reported McGahn’s situation on Sunday.
    

            The pursuit was under a nondisclosure order until May, indicating the Justice Department went to a judge multiple times to keep it secret throughout former President Donald Trump’s years in office. 
    

            It is extraordinary to subpoena a White House counsel’s records.
    

            The Justice Department appears to have accessed McGahn and his wife’s information the same month the department swept up Apple’s data related to dozens of phone numbers and email accounts connected to the House Intelligence Committee, including for two of its Democratic members. 
    

            The DOJ’s move also happened a few weeks after Trump became unhappy with McGahn as he tried to pressure McGahn to cover up his request to fire then-special counsel Robert Mueller, a pivotal move of Trump’s that added fuel to Mueller’s investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice.
    

            The subpoena for McGahn’s records did not come from Mueller’s team of investigators, the source added.
    

            There’s no indication at this time whether the pursuit of McGahn’s records was politically motivated, or what possible case investigators were pursuing.
    

            Former Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein were not aware of this request for information related to McGahn and his wife, according to another source familiar.
    

            Thursday’s revelations about prosecutors seeking records for members of the House Intelligence Committee have led top congressional Democrats to call on former Attorneys General Sessions and William Barr to testify on the matter.
    

            Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Sunday demanded Senate Republicans join Democrats to subpoena Barr and Sessions, as well as John Demers, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department’s national security division. Key Republicans have mostly issued statements focusing on the potential leaks DOJ was investigating rather than the methods, and withheld judgment on whether the department was following the rules.
    

            “This is not just some kind of Washington insider thing,” Schumer said at a Sunday news conference in New York City. “It’s about people’s phone records being subpoenaed without them even knowing about it, and who knows who would be next. Everyday Americans are appalled by the notion that any President via their political appointees could manipulate the democratic system, and tap into personal phone data – that’s not American. What has happened here are fingerprints of a dictatorship, not a democracy.”
    

            Sessions – the attorney general at the time of the Apple subpoena – was recused from all matters related to the Russia probe so a related leak investigation would have fallen under Rosenstein, CNN has reported.
    

            Rosenstein has told people in recent days he was not aware of the subpoena that targeted the data of Democratic members of Congress while he was deputy attorney general, a source familiar with Rosenstein told CNN on Saturday.
    

            Barr, who took office a year after the subpoena was issued, also said Friday he does not recall discussing a probe of lawmakers.
    

            The Justice Department’s inspector general is launching an investigation into the department’s handling of the leak investigation.
