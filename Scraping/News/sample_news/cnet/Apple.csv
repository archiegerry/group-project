"Apple now has a prototype foldable iPhone display, report says",https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-now-has-a-prototype-foldable-iphone-display-report-says/,"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    No plans have been announced to launch a foldable iPhone yet.
  
Apple might be looking to add a foldable phone to its suite of products.
Apple has already begun developing a foldable iPhone, Bloomberg reported Friday. So far, the tech giant has only worked on a prototype display with no set plans for a launch date, the report said, citing unnamed sources.
The prototype foldable screen has an invisible hinge, Bloomberg said. An Apple patent for a foldable iPhone first appeared almost a year ago, but Apple has yet to announce any plans.

If it entered the market with a foldable phone, Apple would be competing with Samsung's Galaxy Fold and Galaxy Flip, as well as the Motorola Razr and Huawei Mate XS. Back in December 2018, Google similarly filed a patent for a foldable mobile device.
For the 2021 iPhones, Apple is only planning minor changes, according to the report, but could include an in-screen fingerprint sensor.
Apple didn't respond to a request for comment. "
How to get started with Apple's new Fitness Plus workout Time to Walk,https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/how-to-get-started-with-apples-new-fitness-plus-workout-time-to-walk/,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Quit staring at a screen while you work out. Go outside, take a walk and listen to celebrities tell you stories with Time to Walk.
  
You can view details about each session, including previewing the songs. 
Last week, Apple released a new feature for subscribers to its Fitness Plus service, and it's available right now. Time to Walk features various celebrities, including Dolly Parton and Draymond Green, telling stories as they themselves are on a walk, and includes a few songs to listen to as you go for a stroll around the block. 
You can think of Time to Walk as short podcast episodes available directly on your Apple Watch, designed to inspire you to get moving, ranging from 25 to 45 minutes.
Below I'll guide you through everything you need to know about Time to Walk, including what Apple gear is required, as well as how to sync episodes and start workouts.
You'll need an iPhone that's synced with your 
  Apple Watch
 too. A Fitness Plus subscription is $10 (£10, AU$15) a month, or $80 (£80, AU$120) a year. It can be shared through Apple's Family Sharing feature and is included with the Apple One Premier plan that gets you 2TB of iCloud Drive storage, Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade and Apple News Plus for $30 (£30, AU$40) a month. 
If you've already set up your 
  AirPods
 with another Apple device, they'll automatically be available on your Apple Watch. To pair regular Bluetooth headphones with your Watch, put your headphones in pairing mode, then on your Watch go to Settings > Bluetooth and then tap the name of your headphones and follow the prompts. 
Quickly start a walk in the Workouts app, view details or connect your AirPods with ease. 
When you're ready to start a walk, open the Workout app on your Apple Watch. At the top of the workouts will be a Time to Walk session that's been synced with your watch (more on how to sync them below). You can tap on the tile to launch the workout right away, or if you tap the small icon near the top-right corner, you'll find a list of all the sessions currently available -- even those that haven't been downloaded to your watch. 
Select any of the cards to launch that workout right away, or tap on the i icon to view length, details and the list of songs that you'll listen to throughout the session. 
If there's a small cloud icon on the card, that means it hasn't been synced with your watch and instead you'll need either a cellular plan on your watch (should you want to leave your 
  iPhone
 behind) or to bring your iPhone with you so it can stream the workout. 
During each episode, you will periodically feel gentle taps on your wrist that let you know a photo related to whatever the speaker is talking about is available to look at. Shawn Mendes, for example, talks about performing with Justin Bieber during his episode, which prompts you to look at a photo of the two celebrities sitting together. Later in the episode, he talks about walking on a beach, and a photo of him on that beach is shown. 
You can manually add sessions to your watch in the Fitness app on your phone. 
With a Fitness Plus subscription, new Time to Walk sessions should automatically sync with your Apple Watch while it's on the charger and your iPhone is nearby. Or you can manually install them by opening the Fitness app on your iPhone and selecting the Time to Walk tile. 
For each episode you'll see a brief description, its length and which songs are included. Tap the Add button to download that episode to your watch; just make sure to place your watch on a charger when syncing shows. Wait a few minutes for the session to sync, then put your watch back on your wrist. 
Apple says it will add new episodes every Monday through April, and you'll be able to go back and listen to previous episodes at any time. 
There are currently four different episodes available: Dolly Parton, Draymond Green, Shawn Mendes and Uzo Aduba. The company hasn't announced who else will share their perambulatory stories.

"Can't sign out of iCloud on your iPhone, iPad or Mac? This is probably why",https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/cant-sign-out-of-icloud-on-your-iphone-ipad-or-mac-this-is-probably-why/,"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    There's a confusing reason why you can't click or tap on the sign out button on Apple's phone.
  
I've used this trick a number of times to sign out of my account. 
When you're getting ready to sell or trade in your old iPhone, Mac or iPad, it's a good idea to sign out of your accounts before factory resetting it. Naturally, Apple's iCloud is one such account. But signing out of your iCloud account isn't always a simple process.  
This Apple support page walks you through signing out of iCloud on every Apple device makes it seem like it's a straight-forward process -- open settings or system preferences, navigate to the iCloud account section and tap or click the Sign Out button.  
But what do you do if the button is greyed out? Unclickable? Untappable? The support page doesn't mention it, but here's what I've learned: You need to turn off Screen Time before you can sign out of iCloud.  
Screen Time is a feature built into your Mac, iPhone or iPad that tracks how much time you spend on your devices, or how many notifications you receive, and from which apps, in a given day. And for some reason, it can block you from removing your iCloud account from your device. We've reached out to Apple for more clarification on why that is. 
So, if you find yourself staring at a Sign Out button that won't work, here's what you need to do.  
After doing this, you should be good to go. 
On your iPhone or iPad, follow these steps.  
1. Open the Settings app.  
2. Tap Screen Time from the list of options.  
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page where you'll find a button labeled Turn Off Screen Time; tap it.  
4. Enter your Screen Time passcode if prompted and then confirm your decision to turn it off.  
With Screen Time disabled, you should be able to go to your iCloud account and the Sign Out button will work. If it still isn't showing up as active, restart your device and it should work then.  
When Screen Time is turned on, this button will be what you need to click to turn it off. 
1. Open System Preferences.  
2. Click Screen Time.  
3. Your account should be selected by default, if not use the drop down to select your name.  
4. Click the button labeled Turn Off... and follow the prompts.  
Finally, go back to the iCloud account settings page and the Sign Out button should magically work now. If it still isn't showing up as active, restart your Mac and it should work then.  
It's unclear why Screen Time can prevent you from signing out of iCloud on your iPhone and more, but nonetheless, it's an easy fix. We also have some tips for troubleshooting and fixing other iPhone problems, like poor battery life. If you're just getting started with a new iPhone, here are some settings you should change right away. And, finally, we also have a roundup of tips and tricks we found in iOS 14. "

    Commentary: Samsung dropping a few features makes sense, but there would be real courage in keeping at least some of them.
  
Samsung's Galaxy S21 line no longer comes with a power adapter, headphones or microSD card slot. 
Samsung's Galaxy S21 line has plenty going for it. The displays have been improved, the processor has gotten faster and the cameras have been upgraded to take sharper photos and videos. And at a $200 cheaper starting price than the Galaxy S20, they are once again an enticing alternative to 
  Apple's
 latest iPhones. The Galaxy S21 line hits shelves today, and here's how you can buy one.
Read more: Check out CNET's Galaxy S21 review and Galaxy S21 Ultra review
But in seemingly taking a page out of Apple's playbook, Samsung is scaling back on a few things. There is once again no headphone jack, the microSD card slot is gone and a fast charger is no longer included in the box. For some, it's like Samsung is copying Apple in all the wrong ways.
Sure, some of these changes should no longer be a surprise. Last year's Galaxy S20 line didn't have a headphone jack, and most pricier 
  phones
 have said goodbye to the port as companies push Bluetooth earbuds and headphones. (Samsung unsurprisingly unveiled its latest $200 Galaxy Buds Pro earbuds at the same event as the S21.) This year Samsung, like Apple with the iPhone 12, went a step further and also removed the included wired headphones, which makes sense as it clearly wants people to buy its wireless buds. 
It is, however, giving up to $200 in Samsung Credit for those who are preordering its new phones directly from Samsung.com. The credit can be used toward buying a pair of Buds Pro or other accessories, softening the blow for at least early adopters.  
The microSD card slot was also seemingly on borrowed time. Samsung already has dropped the expandable storage option on its foldable phones, and a number of other manufacturers have turned away or long ignored the capability. Apple and 
  Google
 never supported microSD storage expansion for their phones, while 
  OnePlus
 only has the option available for its more affordable 
  Nord
 series. 
""Over time, SD card usage has markedly decreased on smartphones because we've expanded the options of storage available to consumers,"" the South Korean electronics giant said in a statement. The company notes that its phones come with at least 128GB of storage while also supporting 
  5G
 and Wi-Fi 6E for faster wireless transfers to and from cloud storage platforms like Microsoft's 
  OneDrive
 and 
  Google Drive
. 
While I can understand why this is frustrating for some power users, the idea of losing the microSD card slot never really bothered me. I also do appreciate that the base storage option is 128GB across the board, not 64GB like on Apple's 
  iPhone 12
 and 
  12 Mini
.
Samsung's following Apple's leading and dropping the charger from the box. 
What I'll really miss, however, is the power adapter. 
Apple kicked this ""trend"" off last year when it announced that it would no longer be including a charging brick with its latest iPhones. Lisa Jackson, Apple's vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said at the time that removing the products from the box will be better for the environment because it cuts down on waste (though, as some analysts pointed out, there may have been a nice financial benefit on the side to cash in on accessory sales). 
Apple's 5-watt USB chargers that have been included with most iPhones for years are largely wasteful in 2021, ending up in a drawer or staying in the box. It would've been great for Apple to include a faster USB-C charger as it did with the 
  iPhone 11 Pro
 and 11 Pro Max, but in ditching the slow charger the company could pretty easily claim it is helping the environment because so many people have the same charger from various other Apple products they've purchased over the years. 
Read more: Samsung's Galaxy S21 upgrades likely won't spell an end to Galaxy FE or Note lines. Yet
Samsung, like Apple, says it is dropping the included power brick to help the environment. Federico Casalegno, Samsung's senior vice president of experience planning and its design innovation center, explained during Thursday's virtual press conference that ""many of our users prefer to reuse their current chargers and earphones and to leave the new ones in the box, unused."" Just like Apple, Samsung is shrinking its packaging for the S21 line in a bid to reduce its footprint.
Unlike Apple's chargers, however, Samsung's chargers have been getting more useful to me over time as the company's included power bricks can fast-charge devices over USB-C. For the Galaxy S20, Samsung included a 25-watt fast charger which, well, is actually pretty great. 
The company says on its website for the S21 Ultra 5G that using that same type of power adapter can recharge the Ultra's 5,000-mAh battery in ""about an hour."" 
Any effort to help the environment and solve the growing e-waste problem should be commended, but instead of dropping features, it would've been great to see Samsung take the lead and embrace new technologies such as gallium nitride for its chargers. This technology not only offers a fast way to charge but also is more energy-efficient, wasting less heat compared to traditional silicon chargers. 
If it coupled offering newer, faster chargers with the S21 with an incentive of an extra few bucks for people to trade in their older chargers with their phones, it could've flipped the conversation. By recycling plenty of older chargers and giving users a more energy-efficient way to power their fancy new phones, Samsung would still be helping the environment while not taking away a useful feature from consumers.  
And it's not like these new gallium nitride chargers are overly expensive. A new 30-watt USB-C GaN charger from AmazonBasics is available for less than $20, roughly the same price Samsung charges for a new 25-watt power adapter on its website. "

    Watch out for massive falling cupcakes in FiftyTwo's new game.
  
Apple Arcade's catalog of games continued growing Friday with the addition of Populus Run, an endless-runner game from Russian studio FiftyTwo. The quirky title lets you control a crowd of people as they run along gathering coins and dodging giant food obstacles. You can try your hand at Populus Run this weekend across iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod Touch and Apple TV. 
The game is deceptively difficult when you start, but it's hilarious. Think Vanellope's Sugar Rush racing game from Wreck-it Ralph meets Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. The controls are easy to pick up as you try to navigate your crowd of runners through jumping macaroons, tumbling cupcakes and rolling cookies. 
The goal is to reach the end of the race with at least one runner, and along the route, you can collect other people into your group. The bigger your crowd is, the more potential casualties. Keeping an eye on the obstacles ahead is key to making it to the end.  
Fans of Fall Guys or Apple Arcade's Butter Royale might enjoy this game. It's almost as addicting as Spire Blast was last week.
Here's a look at gameplay from FiftyTwo:  
Apple entered the mobile-gaming world more than a year ago with the release of Apple Arcade. The subscription gaming service costs $5 a month and lets you play nearly 150 new and exclusive games across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod Touch and Apple TV. 
In addition, with the release of Apple's iPhone 12 devices, you can get a three-month free trial of Apple Arcade with the purchase of a new device. Even if you don't buy a new phone, if you're signing up for Apple Arcade for the first time, you get a one-month free trial. The Apple One subscription bundle also launched last year, which makes it easier and more affordable to get up to six Apple subscription services, Apple Arcade included, for one price.

"Qualcomm pays $1.4B for Nuvia, a server chip designer founded by ex-Apple execs",https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/qualcomm-pays-1-4b-for-nuvia-a-server-chip-designer-founded-by-ex-apple-execs/,"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    But Qualcomm won't just use Nuvia's high-performance and battery efficient technology for data centers. It plans to bring the innovations to its mobile, computer and auto processors.
  
Nuvia has been trying to change data centers by designing high-performance chips that are more power efficient like mobile processors.

  Qualcomm
 is betting big on a company designing powerful but power-efficient chips for data centers -- $1.4 billion big. The company on Wednesday said it has reached a deal to acquire Nuvia, a two-year-old startup run by former 
  Apple
 chip executives. 
But Qualcomm won't just be aiming its newly acquired technology at servers. Instead, it plans to use Nuvia CPUs -- the brains of devices -- in everything from its smartphone chips to its laptop processors and automotive components. That could mean much more powerful and battery efficient Samsung Galaxy smartphones, Lenovo laptops and General Motors cars. 
While Nuvia and Qualcomm both use Arm technology for their processors, Qualcomm licenses the cores from Arm while Nuvia designs its own. It allows the startup to customize them for high performance and power efficiency better than Qualcomm is able, as well as makes it less reliant on Arm, which is being acquired by Nvidia for $40 billion. That's important as mobile-like chips expand to more areas, 
  5G
 becomes widespread and consumers and businesses demand more and more battery life from their devices. Apple also designs its own Arm-based processor cores. Qualcomm previously designed its own cores but moved away from that strategy.
""5G, the convergence of computing and mobile architectures, and the expansion of mobile technologies into other industries are significant opportunities for Qualcomm,"" Cristiano Amon, Qualcomm's president who will take on the role of CEO this summer, said in a press release. ""Together [with Nuvia], we are very well positioned to redefine computing and enable our ecosystem of partners to drive innovation and deliver a new class of products and experiences for the 5G era.""
Qualcomm has long been known as the world's biggest wireless chipmaker, and it counts 
  Samsung


Qualcomm's acquisition of Nuvia also could give Arm PCs the boost they need. While Apple's first Arm-based computers have earned rave reviews, early Windows PCs that use Qualcomm chips have been described as under powered. That could change when the company incorporates Nuvia's technology into its processors. Already, companies like Samsung and Microsoft use Qualcomm processors in tablets and PCs instead of powerful but battery hungry chips from Intel.
""This acquisition and the pedigree of the team Qualcomm acquired now positions [it] to go back to fully custom-designed CPU cores and back to a proprietary CPU architecture, which I think is the right technical direction for Qualcomm,"" Creative Strategies analyst Ben Bajarin noted. 
Nuvia overall will help Qualcomm better compete against Apple, which has become a leader when it comes to chip performance. Apple's A Series chips have long powered its 
  iPhones
 and 
  iPads
, and late last year, it introduced its first computers that use its own M1 processors instead of chips from Intel. The new computers have powerful performance, but also sip battery life, largely because of the innovations Apple has packed deep inside its chips. 
Nuvia's co-founders -- Gerard Williams III, Manu Gulati and John Bruno -- previously held roles in Apple's semiconductor design business before starting their own company. Williams, who serves as Nuvia's CEO, led the design of every Apple chip core from the A7 to the A12X before he left the company in March 2019. Before joining Apple in 2010, Williams for 12 years worked at Arm, the company whose designs are used in virtually all mobile processors. Gulati and Bruno also spent time at 
  Google
 before co-founding Nuvia. The three, along with Nuvia's other employees, will be joining Qualcomm. 
""CPU performance leadership will be critical in defining and delivering on the next era of computing innovation,"" Williams said in a press release. ""The combination of Nuvia and Qualcomm will bring the industry's best engineering talent, technology and resources together to create a new class of high-performance computing platforms that set the bar for our industry.""
Nuvia does not yet have a working product, but the company has captured the attention of many big players in the 
  tech industry
. In September, it raised $240 million from Peter Thiel's Mithril Capital, 
  Dell's
 venture arm, Marvell's founders and various other firms. At the time Nuvia said it expected to have a product in customers' hands in 2022. In total, Nuvia raised just shy of $300 million before the acquisition, and it has over 200 employees.
""Nuvia was launched to reimagine silicon for a world creating exponentially more data than it can process,"" Mithril founder and managing general partner Ajay Royan said in a press release. After Mithril's $70 million investment in September, which gave it a 12.5% stake in Nuvia, Royan joined the startup's board. Its ""unique approach overcomes false trade-offs between energy efficiency and chip performance,"" he added.
It also has been in Apple's crosshairs. The iPhone giant filed a lawsuit against Williams in December 2019 for breach of contract. It accused him of starting Nuvia while still at Apple and said he recruited his former colleagues. Williams countersued in February 2020, alleging Apple has been doing the same thing it accused him of -- trying to recruit his employees.
Despite Williams' legal troubles, Nuvia's efforts to design its own cores reduce its -- and now Qualcomm's --reliance on Arm at a time there's uncertainty surrounding the chip designer. Nvidia, which is in the process of buying Arm, directly competes with many of Arm's other customers, including Qualcomm. Longtime chip analyst Jim McGregor, of Tirias Research, noted in a blog post, that the announcement of the Nvidia-Arm deal ""sent shockwaves through the Arm ecosystem.""
""Having its own custom CPU could ... allow Qualcomm to transition to other processor instruction sets in the future if further concerns arose about Arm under Nvidia ownership,"" he noted. 
Qualcomm's press release about the acquisition contained quotes from its partners, applauding the purchase. They included Panos Panay, chief product officer of Microsoft; Hiroshi Lockheimer, senior vice president of platforms & ecosystems at Google; TM Roh, president and head of mobile communications at Samsung; Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun and executives from Acer, Asus, Bosch, Continental, General Motors, HMD, Honor, 
  HP
, 
  Lenovo
, 
  LG
, OnePlus, Oppo, Panasonic, Vivo, Renault, Sharp and Vivo. 
""Compute performance, connectivity and power efficiency are critical ingredients that make the billions of Android and 
  Chrome OS
 devices shine,"" Google's Lockheimer said. ""The addition of Nuvia extends Qualcomm's capabilities in these three areas, and we're excited to see the next generation of Snapdragon with Nuvia.""    "
Apple TV: 11 essential tips to master Apple's streaming box,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/apple-tv-11-essential-tips-to-master-apples-streaming-box/,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    The Apple TV is a seemingly simple device, but it's gained so many new features over the years. Here's the latest you need to know.
  
There's little doubt that the Apple TV is in desperate need of a refresh. Rumors currently point to a new streaming box arriving sometime this year with improved gaming features, an easier to find remote and a more powerful processor inside the small black box.
Even though a new Apple TV is possibly on the horizon, the current Apple TV lineup is worth the investment for Apple fans and users. And once you get the shiny new box setup, there are some things you'll need to learn. For instance, getting around the Siri remote can feel simplistic, but there are some hidden shortcuts that will surely make your life easier. 
You can even use your AirPods or a HomePod with the Apple TV to listen to your favorite show or movie. Below you'll find 11 tips and tricks to get the most out of your Apple TV.
The Apple TV remote is in desperate need of an overhaul. It's small, easily lost, and the trackpad that's used to tap and swipe your way through the Apple TV's interface can be frustrating. But, it's what you're stuck with. So, in an effort to make the most out of the situation, below are some of the gestures and tips we've learned from our time using the Siri remote. 
Of course, you can use the power of Siri by pressing and holding the Siri button (the one with the microphone icon on it) and speaking a command. You can say things like, ""Jump forward 10 minutes,"" ""Get me some new shows on Netflix"" or ""Who directed this?"" The list of Siri commands for Apple TV is expansive. 
Still, the true beauty of the Siri remote are all the hidden hotkey functions. 
You don't have to use your TV's full remote. With a couple of settings tweaks, you can use the Apple TV to control everything. 
The Siri remote can almost totally replace the remote for your television (at least when using the Apple TV). It's generally enabled automatically, but if your Siri remote isn't controlling your TV's volume, go to Settings > Remotes and Devices and make sure Control TVs and Receivers is set to On. If the volume control still isn't working, click Volume Control and click Auto. 
The Apple TV can also power on and off almost television, but this is dependent upon the television itself. You will need to enable CEC, which has over a dozen different names depending on your TV brand. 
Once enabled, when you press a button on the Siri remote, your television should power on. And when you sleep the Apple TV, your TV should also power off. 
AirPods and Apple TV go together like peanut butter and jelly. 
The next time you want to binge your favorite new series late at night without disturbing your partner, connect your AirPods to your Apple TV. Your AirPods should already be paired with the streaming box, so all you need to do is put your AirPods on, then long-press the TV button, select the AirPlay icon and then scroll down and click on your AirPods.  
All audio will be beamed from the Apple TV straight to your ears, letting everyone else around you get some sleep while you watch just one more episode.  
Use your HomePod as TV speakers for improved sound. 
If you have full-size HomePods, you can use the smart speakers to create a home theater sound system. Alternatively, if you only have a HomePod Mini, you can stream your Apple TV's audio through the speaker for improved sound.  
There's a few different ways of getting the home theater feature working, but here's the gist: You'll need an Apple TV 4K, and one or two of the bigger HomePod models. 
Make sure the HomePod and Apple TV are located in the same room in the Home app on your iPhone or iPad. If you have two HomePod speakers you want to use as a stereo pair, you'll need to create that pair before assigning them to the same room as your TV.  
The next time you turn on your Apple TV, you'll be asked if you want to use the HomePod as your TV speakers. If you aren't prompted, open the Settings app on your Apple TV and go to Video and Audio > Default Audio Output and select the speaker you want to use. 
You can pair true gaming controllers to the Apple TV for gaming. 
If you don't have AirPods but have a pair of Bluetooth headphones, you're not left out. Whether you're looking to play some casual games with a controller or watch a TV show without disturbing others late at night, Bluetooth is your best friend. 
While you can play some simple games with the Siri remote, the Apple TV is compatible with MFi (Made for iPhone) controllers as well as a select list of Xbox and PlayStation controllers.  To pair a controller, turn it on and put it into pairing mode. Then, on the Apple TV, go to Settings > Remotes and Devices > Bluetooth. Look for the controller to appear under Other Devices and click it. Now when you turn it on, it will automatically connect to the Apple TV.
The same goes for Bluetooth headphones, which is especially helpful to late night watching if you don't want the sound of the television keeping everyone in the house up. And you can replace the Siri remote with a Bluetooth keyboard, if you so wish. Just put the device in pairing mode, then visit the Bluetooth section in the Apple TV settings to finish the pairing process. 
While the Apple TV works almost flawlessly most of the time, things can go awry from time to time. Apps can freeze or stop working. We've previously covered five common Apple TV problems (and how to fix them), but your best friend will almost certainly be the force reboot option. There are two ways to do this: 	
Speaking of replacing the Siri remote, if you happen to misplace it or break it, replacing it is a cool $59. 
But you can avoid replacing it altogether. Built into your iPhone or iPad is the Apple TV remote app, and if you're using your own profile to stream and watch shows, you'll notice that your lock screen automatically displays controls. You have pretty much all the functions of the Siri remote, including volume control. 
It also comes with the handy option to let you type searches and other text input using the onscreen keyboard on your iOS device, instead of having to hunt and peck with the on-screen Apple TV keyboard. You can even use it to sign into apps with a password manager like iCloud Keychain or 1Password. 
View your HomeKit devices on your Apple TV, including live video streams. 
If you have any smart home devices that work with 
  HomeKit
, your Apple TV will act as a hub for them, and you can use the Siri remote to control your house. 
Setup is a breeze -- just connect your HomeKit devices to the Home app on your iOS device and make sure the Apple TV is signed in to the same iCloud account as you use on your phone. To make sure it's set up properly, go to Settings > AirPlay and HomeKit and look to see that it's connected as a hub. If not, double check the user account by going to Settings > Users and Accounts > click on your account name then select iCloud to see what email address it's using. 
As long as all of that is working, you should be able to press the Siri button on the remote and tell it to turn your lights on or off, or unlock a door -- depending on what kind of HomeKit devices you have around your home. 
The real beauty of HomeKit working with Apple TV is that your Apple TV will work as a remote hub, so you can control your home while you're away. 
If you have any HomeKit compatible cameras, you can watch live streams or get alerts when someone rings your doorbell, for example, right on your TV. Just long-press the TV button, highlight and click the HomeKit icon to take control of your home. 
Use the Apple TV app as your go-to spot for finding what to watch next, regardless of which app owns the show. 
The Apple TV app has become the centralized hub for all the stuff you watch, or might want to watch. When you open an app like Discovery Go, you'll be asked if you want to give the TV app access to the app. Doing so will allow it to track the shows you're watching and put new episodes in front of all the other stuff under the Up Next section. The TV app is also where you will buy new TV shows or movies and where you can find all your previously purchased items.
Perhaps more importantly for some, this is also where you'll find all of the Apple TV Plus shows and movies that Apple releases. 
It's easy to gloss over the TV app, but if you take the time to sign in to your TV provider and include all the streaming apps you use, it will become a helpful tool that will reduce the time you spend clicking around to pick up where you left off or finding something new to watch. 
If you download a new app to your iPhone, it can be automatically installed on your iPad. The same thing can be enabled with your Apple TV -- assuming there's an Apple TV app for something you've installed. 
To enable this, go to Settings > Apps and click Automatically Install Apps to switch it to On. 
This is a much easier way to delete apps. 
You might find yourself going on an application installing spree with your new Apple TV. Or you might have automatically downloaded a bunch of apps you installed on your phone that you never use on your Apple TV. 
If you need to quickly free up storage on your Apple TV, you could go through and delete each app individually from the home screen, which is painstakingly slow and cumbersome. Or you could go to Settings > General > Manage Storage to find a list of installed applications, organized from largest to smallest. There you can click the trash can icon next to each app you want to remove and click Delete to confirm.

The iPhone 11 camera is no slouch. Here are 5 tricks to take stunning photos,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/the-iphone-11-camera-is-no-slouch-here-are-11-tricks-to-take-stunning-photos/,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Get the most out of your iPhone 11's camera with these tips.
  
The iPhone 11 and 11 Pro have a lot of new camera features. 
Apple's iPhone 12 lineup may be getting all of the attention and praise since its release, but that's only because it's shiny and new. Even if you're not upgrading to Apple's latest and greatest, and instead are using the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro or 11 Pro Max, you're bound to be impressed with the cameras' tricks. 
All three phones have stellar cameras that bring you enhanced zoom capabilities, a feature called Deep Fusion and the ability capture photos at night -- see here how the iPhone 11's night mode blows us away. 
Taking pictures is just as easy as it's always been on previous iPhones, but Camera settings you can adjust along with features that just work in the background, like Deep Fusion, are worth knowing about. We'll help you get you started. 
The next time you want to take a group photo with your iPhone and use the built-in timer, you may have a hard time finding the toggle. 
  Apple
 moved the settings toggles for things like the timer and filters because, well, they aren't used all that often. I personally like the clean look, but at some point, you'll surely need to make an adjustment before you take a picture.     
To view all of the toggles, tap on the arrow that's at the top of the screen if you're holding your iPhone vertically. The arrow will change directions and reveal the various toggles -- flash, live photos, aspect ratio, timer and filters -- and you tap the button again to hide them once you're done. Alternatively, you can also swipe across the viewfinder to reveal the toggles.     
Your quick settings are still there. 
When the iPhone 11 first launched, there was a special feature that let you zoom out on a photo after you captured it. It was confusing and it wasn't all that clear when it would actually work, which I think is why Apple changed it to **View Outside the Frame**. When this feature is turned on, the viewfinder on your iPhone will show you what the iPhone 11's extra cameras can  see. For example, if you're taking group photo using the Wide camera, but struggling to get everyone in the shot, you can preview what the ultra-wide camera will capture. 
The preview, if you will, is behind the typically black interface where the shutter button and settings are. When this feature is turned on and you switch between cameras, that black area will become transparent to give you a glimpse. 
While it may not be as useful as zooming out on a shot after the fact, it's sure to lead to less confusion and a more consistent experience overall. 
If that sounds appealing to you, open the Settings app and select Camera. Scroll down and turn on View Outside the Frame. 
A photo captured using the iPhone 11's Deep Fusion tech. 
Ah, yes. Deep Fusion. It's a buzz term that Apple coined when it announced the iPhone 11, and it was later released in iOS 13.2. There isn't a Deep Fusion setting or toggle for you to turn on. Your iPhone 11 will take photos using the new technology when appropriate. CNET's Patrick Holland explains how it works and when Deep Fusion is used in greater detail. 
My advice? Take a photo in an area with medium lighting of an object that has a lot of details, like a pet's face or a colorful blanket, and then zoom in on it to see the finer details. It's pretty impressive, and thankfully, you don't have to do anything. 
Using the iPhone 11's new Night Mode is something you really don't have to think about. Whenever your iPhone determines there's not enough light available, the Night Mode icon (it looks like a moon with a few lines through it) will show up next to the arrow button. If it's yellow, that means Night Mode is active.     
The button will also display a length of time, such as ""1s,"" (one second) indicating how long it will take to capture the photo, which means that's how long you'll have to hold still after pressing the shutter button.    
Adjust Night Mode, including turn it off, by moving the slider up or down. 
When taking a Night Mode photo, you're not left at the mercy of your iPhone. You can adjust or turn off Night Mode by tapping on the Night Mode icon, and then moving the slider next to the shutter button. Set it to 0 to disable Night Mode for the next photo, or adjust the amount of time to increase or decrease the amount of light Night Mode captures.    
For example, if you move the timer from 2s to 9s, then your iPhone is going to capture an overall brighter picture, at the risk of overexposure. On the flip side, if you go from 5s to 1s, the end result will likely be a darker photo.    
Play around with Night Mode by making those adjustments and have some fun with it.    
The next time you're at a concert and want to get a closer picture of Taylor Swift, or want to make sure you capture your kid's adorable costume during a school play, take advantage off all three cameras and their respective levels of zoom.     
The iPhone 11 has an ultrawide-angle camera and a wide camera. The iPhone 11 Pro and 
  iPhone 11 Pro Max
 have the same two cameras, along with a telephoto camera. All three cameras are 12 megapixels each.     
Regardless of which iPhone you have, the main camera is the wide camera, the option that's labeled ""1x"" in the camera app. If you want to switch between cameras, you can tap on the zoom option -- either 0.5x or 2x. Your iPhone's viewfinder will immediately zoom in or out.    
Scroll up or down to zoom in and out using the iPhone 11's new camera setup. 
But you can fine-tune just how far you want to zoom, in either direction, by long-pressing on the zoom level and then dragging the zoom tool. You can zoom anywhere from 0.5x to 10x by using the new zoom wheel.    
Just keep in mind that if you select something other than the three fixed cameras -- 0.5x, 1x, 2x -- your photo quality may suffer due to the camera digitally zooming, instead of using the fixed focal lengths of built-in cameras.    
If you're just getting started with your iPhone 11, read our piece about a really easy way to set up your new iPhone 11 or 11 Pro. Once it's set up, these are the first five things you should do with your new iPhone. And then, you should probably get caught up on everything iOS 14 adds to the equation to make the iPhone 11 a truly powerful phone."
One Week With Apple Fitness Plus: Beating My Lockdown Weight Gain,https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/one-week-with-apple-fitness-plus-beating-my-lockdown-weight-gain/,"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    I'm just getting started with Apple's new workout app, and already the pounds are dropping.
  
I'm one week into my new Apple Fitness Plus-based workout regime, and I've not only started to lose weight but also learned a lot about how to use Apple's new service -- and how it could be improved.  
I weighed in on Monday, Jan. 4, at 105 kg (around 231 pounds). On Monday, Jan. 11. that weight had dropped to 103 kg (227 pounds). It's a small change, but one I'm very pleased with in just one week. I've exercised every day, mostly using Apple Fitness Plus classes, mixed with some longer cardio sessions using the Zwift cycling app on a Wattbike Atom. 
Here's how I've found Apple's service so far. 
The classes are fun and engaging. I was worried that they'd be too ""gym bro"" for me, but I like the trainers I've experienced so far. There's a decent mix of gender and ages, and they're encouraging enough in the workout sessions to keep me moving and wanting to complete each exercise. The app works seamlessly with my 
  Apple Watch Series 6
, showing my heart rate and calories burned on the 
  iPad
 screen to check that I'm putting the effort in. On one dance class, I noticed my heart rate lingering around only 115 bpm – a more demanding high-intensity interval training (HIIT) class saw that number jump to 182 bpm.  
But what I feel I'm lacking in the service is proper guidance on exactly what classes I should be focusing on to achieve my goals.   
My goal is weight loss, primarily, but I'd like to be stronger and fitter too. So which classes do I choose? Will a HIIT class be better than a cycle class? Will a core workout help me more than a strength workout? Should I be combining multiple classes in one session, and if so, are some better to do together than others? I know it's not good to overwork certain muscle groups at once, but I also don't know enough about what's involved in each class to make those decisions.  
The Apple Fitness Plus interface on my iPad. I'd welcome more sections that help you pick classes based on your fitness goals.
It's easy to do one 20-minute strength class, close my activity rings on my 
  Apple Watch
, and pat myself on the back as I consider my day's workout done. And perhaps I had done enough -- or perhaps I should have done more. I'd hoped to see more guided solutions in the service, based on your own personal goals, be it to lose a lot of post-holiday pounds, to improve core strength to help your posture, or to train hard for a cycling competition.  
While there are sections such as ""More of what you do,"" ""Try something new"" and ""Popular,"" these don't give the sort of guidance I need to confidently put together a great weight-loss routine. Without the guidance, Fitness Plus sometimes seems more like just a collection of well-produced workout videos. It wouldn't be difficult either to have professionals put together what would essentially be playlists of classes, such as ""One-month weight loss"" that I can load up each day and do exactly what I'm told by fitness pros.  
Instead, I've built my own workout program that mixes together a variety of different exercises in the week, including more cardio-based sessions like dance and HIIT classes, as well as strength and yoga classes. Based on my limited knowledge of exercise, it seems like a decent all-round program, but I worry I'm basically making it up as I go along and could be using my time better if I changed it up. 
I've been playing my weekly routines in a small notebook and trying my best to make sure I'm doing varied exercises. 
The other problem I found on my first couple of days was understanding the way the classes work in terms of difficulty. While there are ""absolute beginner"" classes to introduce you to the different sorts of classes, the main workout videos themselves are not separated in terms of ""beginner"" or ""challenging,"" but instead seem to be different from one another simply by the trainer running the class and the genre of music you'll be working out to.  
I eventually realized that there are multiple trainers in each video, and you'll be able to do the ""easier"" workouts with one (having your knees on the ground during a pushup, for example), do the standard workout with the main trainer or add in an extra challenge with the third trainer. I suppose the idea is that it means that everyone can get something out of every video available, but I didn't quite get that at first and found it a little difficult to navigate, resorting to a ""Well, I guess this one will do"" approach. Again, more guidance within the app would have made a huge difference to a beginner.  
Healthy eating has, of course, been a big part of my new fitness plan.
That all said, I've genuinely enjoyed my first week of workouts, and I'm thrilled to already be losing weight. Here's what else I've enjoyed:  
It hasn't taken me long to begin to understand how Apple Fitness Plus works, and the weekly routine I've put together seemed to be challenging enough to leave me exhausted at the end of each one, but not so sore I couldn't manage next day's either. Mixing in the longer cycles with Zwift, I'm confident that I'm going to continue enjoying the process and, crucially, continue to lose weight.

    Apple's new Macs can run the same apps that you use on your iPhone. Here's what you need to know.
  
Apple's new M1-powered MacBooks can run iPhone and iPad apps. 
Did you know that some of 
  Apple's
 Macs will now let you run the same exact apps you currently use on your iPhone and iPad? That's thanks to the new Apple silicon processor, the M1, that's now used in the 2020 models of the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini. It's one of several benefits to the Mac platform due to Apple's move away from 
  Intel
 chips, including longer battery life and better performance. 
I use it daily to check the weather in Dark Sky, use the 
  Instagram
 app (and yes, you can post with it) or monitor my Wyze camera feed. These are all tasks I normally would have to reach for my phone to do, but now can be done directly on my 
  MacBook Pro
.
Note that you don't get full-out access to any 
  iPhone
 app in the App Store. Developers have to opt in to allow their apps to be installed on a Mac after they've optimized the experience for Apple computers with the M1 processor. That means not every app will be available right now, but the library of compatible programs is sure to expand as developers work on adopting the new technology. 
If you're using one of Apple's new M1 Macs and want to get more out of your new computer, here's how to install iPhone or 
  iPad
 apps, including a temporary workaround for apps that aren't listed in the Mac App Store (this will not break your Apple warranty and is considered safe). 
iPhone and iPad apps aren't included in the default search results. 
There are two different ways to find iPhone and iPad apps in the Mac App Store. The first is by using the search box and entering the name of the app you want to install. However, the search results default to Mac apps, so after entering your search terms you'll need to click on iPhone and iPad Apps at the top of the results. 
Easy enough, right? But you'll find it's often difficult to find the apps you're looking for. 
There's another way to find apps you can't easily find in search. 
The other method will allow you to install apps you've previously downloaded on your iPhone or iPad, some of which are available even if they don't show up in the Mac search results. 
Open the Mac App Store and click on your name in the lower-left corner. You'll then see a list of the previously downloaded or purchased Mac apps linked to your Apple ID. Click on iPhone & iPad Apps to switch the view to apps you've installed on your phone or tablet. 
Unfortunately, there isn't a search feature, so if you've downloaded a lot of apps over the years, you'll have to scroll through the list until you find what you're looking for. The apps are listed in chronological order, with the most recent apps at top. 
The M1 Mac Mini is small but powerful. 
There is a workaround here too, but before we dig into the details, you need to know that it's not an official method, and there are already reports that Apple is actively trying to block unauthorized installations. Both 9to5Mac and The Verge have reported that Apple is currently blocking this method, however, when I tried it a few days after those reports were published, I was able to successfully install several new apps, including the official Tesla app that does not offer M1 support. 
That said, it's clear Apple will eventually bar this workaround. If you start to experience issues with installation, it's best to wait for the developer to add official support. 
With that said, here's how to install apps like Instagram on your Mac, thanks to Reddit user probablyamy. 
1. Download and install iMazing. You can use the free trial to test this method out before buying the app.
2. Open iMazing and connect your iPhone or iPad to your Mac. Approve the connection if prompted, and skip the backup when prompted.
3. Click on your device name on the left side of the window to reveal a list of options.
4. Select Apps and wait for it to load all of the apps installed on your device.
5. Click Manage Apps at the bottom of the iMazing window.
6. Enter your Apple ID password when asked.
iMazing will download a copy of an iPhone or iPad app directly to your Mac. 
7. Click Library at the top of the list of installed apps.
8. Go through the list and download the apps you want to install on your Mac.
9. After an app is downloaded, right-click on it in the list and select Export IPA.
10. Select a location to save the IPA file when Finder prompts you, then click Save. I suggest creating a folder on your desktop and saving the files there. Repeat that process for every app you've downloaded.
11. Finally, double-click the IPA file and your Mac will install the app and even add it directly to your Applications folder. 
Once that's done, you can open the app and use it as you would any other app on your Mac. I've installed a few apps using the iMazing method, and it's a breeze. The apps can  have some issues, especially with presenting alerts and prompts for permissions, but they're usable. 
Even after Apple widely blocks installations, it appears you'll still have access to the apps you've already installed. And, perhaps, even have the option to install those apps again. Apple's attempt to block sideloading of apps appears to only focus on new installations. Again, your mileage may vary. 
MacOS 11 Big Sur added plenty of features to all Macs, not just the M1-based computers. If you're on the fence about getting one of the new Macs, be sure to read CNET's review. Or if you want to squeeze a bit more life out of the Mac you currently have, then make sure to read this. "
A pro photographer tests Apple's M1 MacBook,https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/a-pro-photographer-tests-apples-m1-macbook/,"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Apple's new silicon offers great improvements for creative pros, but it doesn't do everything, yet.
  
As a professional photographer, I was intrigued when Apple ditched Intel's chips and instead started using its own M1 silicon in the MacBook lineup. The performance boosts Apple promised were appealing -- as was the supposed battery life improvement -- but I was nervous about having to run my professional software on a platform that wasn't yet properly supported by some of the tools I use every day.  
I've spent some time now with the 13-inch M1-based MacBook Pro (with 16GB RAM) and have run it through a variety of tests to see how well I can work on it. Is it a safe upgrade for photographers or other creative professionals? Or should you wait for promised software updates? 
Apple using its own chips might seem like a small change that you'll never need to think about, but it has a big impact on how software will run. To get the best performance, the programs you use will need to be rewritten to properly take advantage of the new hardware. 
That's potentially a problem, as it requires software developers to support two versions of their products; an Intel version and an Apple M1 version. At the time of writing, Adobe has released an M1 version of Lightroom, but not Lightroom Classic (the version that I, along with most photography pros, still use). The industry-standard Photoshop only supports M1 when you download the beta version, and Adobe hasn't officially given any kind of timeline for when all its Creative Cloud suite of apps will fully support Apple M1.  
Not at all. While these apps aren't optimized, they will still run, thanks to Apple's Rosetta 2 software, which allows Intel versions of software to run as normal. That means any app you'd normally want to use on your MacBook will still be able to run on the new model without any difference in how it operates, and you likely won't see much in the way of performance degradation, although that can vary app by app.  
In my hands-on testing, I found the M1 versions of Adobe's apps to run extremely swiftly. Lightroom ran lightning fast, and allowed for extremely swift editing and exporting. Even Lightroom Classic (the Intel version) still ran well when used via Rosetta 2.  
The improvements are noticeable when using M1-optimized versions. I tested how long it took Photoshop (both in Intel and M1 beta versions) to align 19 full-resolution raw images and then to merge them into a focus-stacked image. It's a technique I use regularly in my product photography, so it's important for me to have good efficiency here.  
Intel-based Photoshop, via Rosetta 2, took 50.3 seconds to align the layers and 1 minute, 37 seconds to merge them. I compared that to an exceptionally powerful Windows desktop PC that was built with an AMD Ryzen 9 3950 X CPU, Nvidia RTX Titan graphics and 128GB RAM, specifically to be a beast with editing photos and 8K video. The PC took 20 seconds to align the layers and 53 seconds to merge them -- a clear victory for the PC.   
I then ran the same tests on the beta version of Photoshop that supports Apple M1. It took 22 seconds to align the layers and 46.6 seconds to merge them -- a faster overall time than my immensely powerful editing rig was able to achieve.   
In the M1-supported version of Lightroom, it took the MacBook 6.4 seconds to import 100 raw images, edging out the PC's time of 7.1 seconds to complete the same task. 
The story was similar when it came to exporting video in Premiere. The Intel-based version of Premiere took 6 minutes, 25 seconds to export on the M1 MacBook, but the optimized M1 beta version took about half the time, at 3 minutes, 24 seconds. For reference, my desktop did the same export in 1:20.  
Other software that isn't optimized still runs as normal, and you'd never know that you're running ""emulated"" versions of software, as the machine's overall performance is still excellent. It took 51 seconds to import 100 raw images into pro image-editing software Capture One, and the desktop wasn't much in front at 48 seconds. Capture One has said an M1-optimized version is coming in an update, but we don't know exactly when this will be. 
Pro video software DaVinci Resolve Studio is also available in beta for M1, and I found it was extremely quick to use, with no issues previewing 4K files in a timeline.  
Overall I'm impressed. Even when running unoptimized versions of apps, the M1 MacBook Pro still puts up a hell of a fight against a superpowered editing PC, and the fact that it's able to outperform the PC on some tests when using M1-optimized beta apps is astonishing. I'm certainly excited about what performance improvements we'll see as more developers fully optimize their software for Apple's silicon.  
If you're a photographer and considering upgrading, I'd absolutely say the M1 MacBook is a safe bet. At the very least you'll still be able to use all your current software as normal via Rosetta 2, and in time when official M1 versions are released, those performance boosts -- and likely the battery life savings as well -- will be extremely welcome.

    I'm losing weight and enjoying the work, without having to set foot in a gym.
  
I'm trying.
At the beginning of January, I started a new workout regime at home based around Apple Fitness Plus and cycling app Zwift using a static Wattbike Atom. Nearly two months in, I've lost a noticeable amount of weight, learned a lot about how to exercise and, crucially, thoroughly enjoyed the process. 
I began my journey weighing about 231 pounds (105 kilograms). I was borderline obese and needed to make significant changes. And changes I've indeed made. I'm pleased to say that since I started my new healthier lifestyle, my weight has dropped to 200 pounds (91 kilograms). 
I faced some issues at first and am still overweight, based on the UK's NHS healthy weight calculator. I ideally need to lose another 22 pounds (10 kilograms) to be in a healthy zone, but I'm proud of the progress I've made so far. The best part is how much I've enjoyed it all. 
I put together a program that included different exercises for every day of the week. Mondays typically include a 10-minute core strength session, while Thursdays might be a longer upper-body strength class, followed by a dance class. It shakes things up and keeps things interesting. I get bored easily, so having different things to do each evening feels good. 
But because they're different types of classes, some strength, some cardio, I'm not overworking any one part of my body, so I always feel ready to go again the following day. The classes are short (I usually choose ones that are 30 mins), so they're easy to fit into my day and are enough to get the sweat pouring but not enough to leave me feeling half dead and too sore to move the next day. 
My weekly workout plan. I'm focusing on doing smaller workouts, but doing them every day. 
Saturdays I do a long cycle of an hour or more on the Wattbike Atom and Zwift, which lets me ride in a virtual world alongside one of my friends, who's using his own static bike at home. We're on the phone throughout and it feels as close as we could get right now to a nice social cycle together. The fact that I also cover over 20 miles in that time and burn hundreds of calories is almost just a bonus. 
I try to fit in an Atom cycle several times a week, usually for around 20-30 minutes and usually on top of some of my Apple Fitness classes. At the time of writing this in late February, I've covered 357 miles on the bike and spent more than 21 hours doing it. I love being able to just hop on anytime I want to get some extra miles in. 
Dance classes have been a real revelation for me. I'm certainly no dancer, but I've really enjoyed the upbeat way the dance classes get me moving, and they've been genuinely a lot of fun as an activity to do with my partner. We don't take it too seriously, we laugh a lot and we get the steps wrong. But we keep moving, our heart rates are high, and we're out of breath at the end, so it's clearly working us well. 
I don't have an ""off day,"" but Sundays are for extended yoga sessions, helping me stretch and condition my muscles, as well as helping with flexibility and core strength -- both of which are key to a healthy body overall. 
Chicken breast and lots of colorful, fresh vegetables. Perfect.
All of this has been paired with a more conscious diet. I'm a massive sugar addict and would typically plough through entire packets of biscuits or bags of Cadbury Mini Eggs (which are incredible) on any given night. I've managed to begin unhooking from that sugar train and haven't bought any treats like that this year -- a big deal, given that they were almost a daily purchase before now. I've also not had any beer since Christmas, and my alcohol intake overall has been down. 
But I've still been eating well, as both myself and my partner love food and cooking good meals at home. We've not had to modify our diet too much, but we've made small changes, like simply measuring out a portion of pasta instead of just filling a bowl with it, and I've not had white bread. My calorie intake overall is down, but it doesn't feel like a restrictive diet, and I'm still enjoying everything I have. Delivered meals have been cut out almost completely though. 
My partner is having similar success, with her weight also dropping steadily while she's been thoroughly enjoying our regular workouts and more calorie-conscious diet. Her biggest problem early on was simply finding workout leggings that didn't start to slide down halfway through, but a pair of LuluLemon high-rise Fast and Free tights have so far proved to be exceptionally comfortable workout leggings for her.
Both my Apple Fitness Plus exercise and my changes in eating habits have done what I've failed to do for years: make exercise and weight loss sustainable for me long term. I've not enjoyed going to the gym, and I always resented how long it took to get across London to my gym, sign in, find a locker, get changed, wait for the machine I wanted, work out, shower, get dressed, get home.
I'm not allowed Mini Eggs. I bloody love Mini Eggs.
It could easily be a four hour process, including travel time, and that meant it became ""the thing"" I did that evening after work and so I could only justify doing it at most once a week. Using Apple Fitness at home means I'm able to fire up the app and enjoy a 30 minute workout before dinner without needing to plan anything around it. It means I can do smaller sessions every day, resulting in a lot of workout minutes by the end of the week, and it means I'm now in the habit of exercising. My question to myself each afternoon is not, ""Am I going to exercise?"" but instead, ""What exercise am I going to do?"" This is new ground for me. 
Of course the elephant in the room for this has been COVID-19. With Britain still in full lockdown, the gyms have remained closed, so working out at home hasn't been so much of a choice but rather the only option. 
In 2020 my partner and I found ourselves ordering more and more food from local restaurants, going outside less and drinking more, leading to an acceleration of weight gain for us both. However, lockdown is now playing into our hands as we try to get fit again. 
With socializing off the table and restaurants and bars being closed, there's no temptation for us to go out and drink beer with friends -- no boozy night out at a burger joint, no sitting in a comfy chair in a pub getting through four pints of local ale -- there are no plans at all. Sure, on one hand that's a real shame, but the flip side is that there's nothing getting in the way of our exercising. No reason for us to ""cheat"" on our diet or skip days to do something more fun.
I've really enjoyed cycling using the Zwift app and seeing my character travel through the virtual world as I pedal.
We also haven't been traveling internationally for work. Usually at this time in most years, I'd be preparing to cover two trade shows for CNET, resulting in two weeks away from home and little time to exercise or eat properly. This would (and has) destroyed any kind of routine I may've built up, but with all travel canceled, I have this golden window of being able to focus fully on my health. 
Lockdown has caused so many problems for so many people, but the one silver lining for me is that my exercise is succeeding not in spite of lockdown but because of it. 
I'm still only in my first steps in what I hope is a new healthier lifestyle for me long term, but I'm certainly encouraged by the progress I've made. I'm visibly slimmer and my T-shirts fit better. I feel stronger when I walk, and while I've always been plagued by low-level back pain, that hasn't even been noticeable since I started exercising -- a benefit I didn't even expect.
I set out to see how much Apple Fitness Plus encourages me to exercise and if it's a good long-term solution for gym-free workouts. So far, my weight loss is a big tick in the service's favor, but it's also taken a lot of commitment from myself in sticking to the program I've put together, and maintaining the healthy eating habits alongside it. 
But these home workouts have been so enjoyable that I want to do them and actively look forward to them, whereas before now I'd typically look for any excuse to skip out on a gym session. Whether that's solely down to the approachability of Apple's service, down to the convenience of doing it at home or down to a change in myself, I can't say for certain (it's likely a bit of all three, to be fair). But I'm very much looking forward to seeing how much further I can get in the next few months. "
"Apple donates $1 million, iPads, other products to LGBTQ youth organization",https://www.cnet.com/culture/apple-donates-1-million-ipads-and-other-products-to-encircle-an-org-for-lgbtq-youths/,"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    The donation, made along with the Utah Jazz basketball team owners and Imagine Dragons singer Dan Reynolds, is the latest in a series of social justice efforts.
  
Apple has earmarked at least $100 million to support social causes since this summer.

  Apple
 is helping a Utah-based nonprofit expand in four states, offering a community center for LGBTQ youths and families. The program, called Encircle, launched in 2017 and operates out of houses it remodels to offer services like art and music studios, community classes and service projects. It also offers free and subsidized group and individual therapy sessions.
""All people should feel safe and supported enough to be open about who they are with their community and themselves,"" Apple CEO 
  Tim Cook
 said in a statement Thursday. ""Encircle is helping to bridge divides and bring people together -- sending a powerful message that the greatest thing you can aspire to become is who you truly are.""
An Encircle home in Provo, Utah.
Encircle said the money will help its efforts to open eight new homes in Arizona, Idaho, Nevada and its home state of Utah. Apple made its investment alongside Ryan Smith and his wife, Ashley, the owners of the Utah Jazz basketball team. Imagine Dragons lead singer Dan Reynolds and his wife, musician Aja Volkman, also donated Reynolds' childhood home to the organization. Apple will offer iPads and other products in addition to its $1 million donation.
The move marks Apple's latest moves with social justice initiatives, which expanded amid racial strife across the US last summer. At the time, Apple said it planned to spend $100 million on education, economic equality and criminal justice reform. Cook said back then it was in order to ""challenge the systemic barriers to opportunity and dignity that exist for communities of color, and particularly for the black community.""
Cook's signaled his interest in charitable giving short after being named CEO in 2011. About a month after he took the job, Cook dipped into Apple's pile of cash and equivalents, to start employee donation matching programs for up to $10,000 per year. In 2012, Cook told employees Apple had also given $50 million each to Stanford University and Product RED, a products brand of which a portion of proceeds go to help fight AIDS around the world.
Tim Cook, during a virtual Apple product launch event, last year.
Cook, who grew up in Alabama during the 1960s and out as gay since 2014, has spoken out on LGBTQ issues.
Apple's $1 million investment in Encircle may seem small in comparison to some of its other efforts, but organization head Stephanie Larsen said its programs -- which have shifted online during the pandemic -- are as important as ever. ""Studies repeatedly have shown that LGBTQ+ youth across the country struggle with depression and suicidality far more than their heterosexual peers, and the pandemic has made that sense of isolation so many feel harder than ever before,"" she said in a statement. ""This incredible support makes our nationwide expansion possible and will improve countless LGBTQ+ lives -- reminding them that they are perfect, just as they are."""
How to get started with Apple's new Fitness Plus workout Time to Walk,https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/how-to-get-started-with-apples-new-fitness-plus-workout-time-to-walk/,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Quit staring at a screen while you work out. Go outside, take a walk and listen to celebrities tell you stories with Time to Walk.
  
You can view details about each session, including previewing the songs. 
Last week, Apple released a new feature for subscribers to its Fitness Plus service, and it's available right now. Time to Walk features various celebrities, including Dolly Parton and Draymond Green, telling stories as they themselves are on a walk, and includes a few songs to listen to as you go for a stroll around the block. 
You can think of Time to Walk as short podcast episodes available directly on your Apple Watch, designed to inspire you to get moving, ranging from 25 to 45 minutes.
Below I'll guide you through everything you need to know about Time to Walk, including what Apple gear is required, as well as how to sync episodes and start workouts.
You'll need an iPhone that's synced with your 
  Apple Watch
 too. A Fitness Plus subscription is $10 (£10, AU$15) a month, or $80 (£80, AU$120) a year. It can be shared through Apple's Family Sharing feature and is included with the Apple One Premier plan that gets you 2TB of iCloud Drive storage, Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade and Apple News Plus for $30 (£30, AU$40) a month. 
If you've already set up your 
  AirPods
 with another Apple device, they'll automatically be available on your Apple Watch. To pair regular Bluetooth headphones with your Watch, put your headphones in pairing mode, then on your Watch go to Settings > Bluetooth and then tap the name of your headphones and follow the prompts. 
Quickly start a walk in the Workouts app, view details or connect your AirPods with ease. 
When you're ready to start a walk, open the Workout app on your Apple Watch. At the top of the workouts will be a Time to Walk session that's been synced with your watch (more on how to sync them below). You can tap on the tile to launch the workout right away, or if you tap the small icon near the top-right corner, you'll find a list of all the sessions currently available -- even those that haven't been downloaded to your watch. 
Select any of the cards to launch that workout right away, or tap on the i icon to view length, details and the list of songs that you'll listen to throughout the session. 
If there's a small cloud icon on the card, that means it hasn't been synced with your watch and instead you'll need either a cellular plan on your watch (should you want to leave your 
  iPhone
 behind) or to bring your iPhone with you so it can stream the workout. 
During each episode, you will periodically feel gentle taps on your wrist that let you know a photo related to whatever the speaker is talking about is available to look at. Shawn Mendes, for example, talks about performing with Justin Bieber during his episode, which prompts you to look at a photo of the two celebrities sitting together. Later in the episode, he talks about walking on a beach, and a photo of him on that beach is shown. 
You can manually add sessions to your watch in the Fitness app on your phone. 
With a Fitness Plus subscription, new Time to Walk sessions should automatically sync with your Apple Watch while it's on the charger and your iPhone is nearby. Or you can manually install them by opening the Fitness app on your iPhone and selecting the Time to Walk tile. 
For each episode you'll see a brief description, its length and which songs are included. Tap the Add button to download that episode to your watch; just make sure to place your watch on a charger when syncing shows. Wait a few minutes for the session to sync, then put your watch back on your wrist. 
Apple says it will add new episodes every Monday through April, and you'll be able to go back and listen to previous episodes at any time. 
There are currently four different episodes available: Dolly Parton, Draymond Green, Shawn Mendes and Uzo Aduba. The company hasn't announced who else will share their perambulatory stories.

The premise is simple enough: Fitness Plus offers guided workouts for every level, whether you're just getting started with your fitness journey, or you're a more advanced gym-goer. There are 10 workout types: treadmill run, treadmill walk, stationary bike, rowing, dance, strength training, core, yoga, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and cooldown. What sets it apart from similar fitness apps like 
  Nike
 Training Club or the 7 Minute Workout is its close integration with the Apple Watch. 
Fitness Plus uses all your previous workout data, from the Apple Watch or any other fitness app that syncs to the 
  Health app
, to help guide your next workout. If you've logged any workouts on your Apple Watch, you'll be given two categories to choose from as soon as you start using the app: more of what you love, or try something new. They're fairly self-explanatory, either serving up similar workouts to what you've done in the past or suggesting new workouts that complement what you've already been doing. My test account of Fitness Plus didn't have access to my workout history, so I wasn't able to test out the recommendations feature for this review, but I'll be updating it once I've been able to test it out on my own account. 
Stats from the Apple Watch like your heart rate, calories burned and elapsed time show up on the iPhone, iPad or Apple TV screen. This helps to put you right in the workout so you don't have to keep glancing at your wrist. You also get a live view of your activity rings, which will fill up throughout the workout. For some workouts, the app even uses your heart-rate data to tell you how much effort you're putting in compared to everyone else who's done it in the past, which Apple calls the burn bar. The instructors also reference heart-rate info to push you during a workout. 
Apple's Fitness Plus app is available on the iPhone, iPad and AppleTV. 
The app will be available on the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV with the latest software updates (iOS 14.3, TVOS 14.3 and iPadOS 14.3 respectively). You'll have to download the Fitness Plus app on your iPad, but it'll come preloaded on the AppleTV and will appear as a new tab within the existing Fitness app on the iPhone. A future software update (still in beta) will also let you to cast to any AirPlay2 compatible TVs and devices, though at launch you'll only be able to see your live stats on the main device running the Fitness Plus app (iPhone or iPad). Once you choose a workout on the screen, it'll automatically start logging the corresponding workout on your Apple Watch (WatchOS 7.2) with no extra effort on your part. You'll also be able to use the watch as a remote to stop or pause the workout at any point.
The app itself is intuitive and easy to navigate. Even if you don't like any of the recommendations, a filter makes it easy to find your next workout. You can search by workout type, duration, instructors and music. There's no way to filter by difficulty level yet, but you can watch a brief trailer to get a sense of what you're in for. 
Within the first two days of testing Fitness Plus, I managed to complete seven out of the nine workout types available, which I thought would be impossible with a full time job and two young kids in the house. 
Time doesn't really seem to be too much of a constraint with Fitness Plus considering you can find anything from a five-minute cooldown to a 45-minute yoga class, depending on your schedule. If you're feeling ambitious, you can even mix and match workout routines. Perhaps a little core work to round out your strength training, or add on a calming cool down at the end of a sweaty HIIT session. The only thing you can't do yet (take note, Apple) is make a playlist that automatically plays back to back with multiple workouts. For now, you can just save them to My Workouts section on the Fitness Plus app to see all in one place. 
Without any recommendations on my test account, I was left to my own devices to choose my first workout. I chose something fairly familiar -- a strength training session in my living room on Apple TV. I do about three outdoor runs a week, which I balance with Pilates to strengthen my muscles. Fitness Plus doesn't offer Pilates yet, so strength training (or yoga) was my closest option. The 30-minute workout felt engaging and high-energy, and the instructor had a good pace. I definitely felt challenged during parts of it, but mostly because of the pace and the weight of my dumbbells. The moves were fairly basic, and it started to get repetitive after a while. What really kept me engaged was watching my heart rate go up and down in real time on the screen. I felt like it kept me honest about how much effort I was putting into each move and I pushed myself more than I would have otherwise. It was also a nice pat on the back to see my exercise ring close on the screen as I was winding down. 
The workouts don't really offer much of a cooldown, which is great when you're tight on time, but you also get the option to add one in from the cooldown section at the end. 
Then I decided to challenge myself to try something I'd never done before: rowing. I'd received a loaner rowing machine as part of my review package so I figured I'd put it to work. But if you don't own a rower, treadmill or stationary bike, that's OK too because you can pick out workouts from the other sections. Most of these can be done with no equipment whatsoever, although sometimes the instructor will recommend a dumbbell or yoga mat. 
Under normal circumstances, I would have been too intimidated to even go near a rower at the gym. But Fitness Plus makes it easier to step out of your comfort zone with an entire beginners section with short, easy workouts along with a ""getting started"" video that teaches you how to use the equipment.
They also provide modifications within each workout video, just look to one of the other two instructors in the back for a slightly easier or more challenging version of the routine. 
I tried out a 10-minute rowing workout on Fitness Plus.
After watching the six-minute intro video for the rowing machine, I was able to complete my first workout without injuring myself. I did, however, slide off the seat the first time I attempted to mount it, which you can check out at the end of my review video if you need a laugh. Even though it was just 10 minutes, it engaged my entire body and got my heart pumping. Enough so that I definitely felt sore the next day (and not from sliding out of the seat). I even scored a 78 on my burn bar which, according to the app, put me ""ahead of the pack,"" although that's not saying much considering the service wasn't available to the public yet. 
I also did a 20-minute HIIT session and a 10-minute core workout outside using the iPhone, and a yoga and a Latin dance session in my living room. The last two didn't end up being as effective, because I tried to get my 1-year-old and 3-year-old involved. Their attention span only lasts for so long. 
You can stream Fitness Plus on your iPhone and take your workout outside. 
What it did allow me was to get to know some of the different instructors and mix up the type of tunes I worked out to. There were definitely some teaching styles that suited me better, but they're all highly engaging and good at motivating you to push yourself throughout the workout. Despite how different they all are, they all convey the same sense of excitement to be teaching you, and there's a consistency in the way they all structure their classes which was extremely helpful. 
The music is also an important part as each workout has its own unique playlist that keeps the momentum going. It's a great way to discover new music without having to spend any time on it. The name and cover album of the song pop up on the screen as you're working out. While everyone can listen along to the songs during the workout, 
  Apple Music
 subscribers can download the entire playlist to their library directly from the Fitness Plus app.
As with any fitness plan, it takes weeks or even months to see changes in your body or fitness level (which the Apple Watch now tracks), and it would be unfair to make a definitive judgment call on Fitness Plus in less than a week. Also, it will likely evolve as more workouts are added on a weekly basis and the algorithm gets better at figuring out what to recommend. But here's what I can say right now after having used it for four days. 
Fitness Plus is a no-brainer if you already own an Apple Watch, or are considering getting one, as you get a free three-month trial. It's also included as part of the Premier Apple One subscription bundle, for $30 (£30, AU$40) a month. But with so many fitness apps out there, it's probably not reason enough to buy an Apple Watch. 
It's also not the best option if you're a pro in any of the workout categories, or you're really looking to hone your skills, as it seems to be geared for a broader audience and it can't offer personalized feedback on form.
Fitness Plus won't make me ditch my Pilates studio anytime soon (once I can go in person), but I'd definitely consider it as a complement to my current routine. Sub in a fun dance session when the weather's too bad for a run, or squeeze in a 10-minute core workout after putting the kids to bed. It's a welcome changeup to my old running and Pilates routine, with different workout types and no-excuse options to get moving whenever or wherever I can. For now, I need to collapse on my couch for the next few days while I recover from this review.

"Apple Car project enlists Porsche engineer in rumored poach, report says",https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-car-porsche-engineer-rumor/,"Thu, 04 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    According to a report out of Germany, one of Porsche's finest left the company to work on the rumored Apple Car.
  
Manfred Harrer helped bring the Taycan to life.
Hyundai is rumored to have a significant involvement in the mysterious Apple Car, and its sister company Kia may even build it here in America. Now, the rumor mill suggests  talent will have a hand in a vehicle from the technology powerhouse. Business Insider Germany reported Thursday that 
  Apple
 has hired Manfred Harrer, who served as Porsche's vice president of chassis development. It would be an enormous score for Apple and a clear sign the company has major automotive plans.
Harrer hasn't made the move public, if it's true, as his LinkedIn profile currently names him the vice president of the Cayenne line of SUVs. BI Germany says Harrer left Porsche quietly at the end of last year to work on the highly secretive Apple Car project. Porsche declined to comment on ""potential personnel matters"" and Apple didn't return a request for comment on Harrer's employment status.
If Harrer did join the Apple team it once called ""Project Titan,"" it throws a wrench in reporting the company will use Hyundai's recently revealed E-GMP electric car platform as the bones of its vehicle. Hiring on a chassis expert such as Harrer might indicate Apple wants to go further than plucking Hyundai parts off a shelf. At a minimum, he could help Apple turn the E-GMP platform into something unique. The rumors suggest game-changing battery technology is part of Apple's push to build a world-beating EV as the electrified era really starts to heat up.
It certainly feels like we're on the verge of hearing some concrete news as reports swirl around Apple and Hyundai. Perhaps the next few months will bring clarity to Project Titan after years of ups and downs. Analysts have warned Apple is still years away from actually having a production vehicle to show, however, should Titan eventually grow physical wheels and a powertrain.

    AirPods Pro vs. Galaxy Buds Pro: Audio, noise canceling and battery life compared between Apple's and Samsung's newest wireless earbuds.
  
Apple's AirPods Pro are among the best wireless earbuds you can buy, but Samsung is taking on the standard-bearer with its slightly more affordable Galaxy Buds Pro. The Buds Pro have almost the same feature set as the AirPods Pro, with active noise canceling and spatial audio support. I've spent two weeks testing both these pairs of earbuds to weigh the pros and cons of each. 
The AirPods Pro are an excellent pair of wireless earbuds with ANC that work seamlessly with iOS and Apple devices. They support spatial audio (aka virtual surround sound) and have a longer-lasting battery with ANC than the Galaxy Buds Pro. Sound quality is balanced, but they don't have a universal equalizer to change the sound across all apps. You can use the AirPods Pro with Android phones, although you lose some features like spatial audio and quick switching.
Read our AirPods Pro review.
  
When it comes to specs, the Galaxy Buds Pro are the most comparable of Samsung's earbud models to the AirPods Pro. They sound great, with a strong bass response, but the battery life doesn't last as long as the AirPods Pro's when ANC is active. They also don't work as well with iPhones as, unlike earlier Galaxy Buds, these aren't supported in the Galaxy Wearable iOS app at the time of writing.
Read our Galaxy Buds Pro review.
  
Both are in-ear earbuds, but they have completely different designs. The AirPods Pro have a clickable stem that sticks out of the ear and they only come in white. The Galaxy Buds Pro come in three colors (silver, black or purple) and have a round design with tap panels on the side, and feel a bit heavier in your ear than the AirPods Pro.
Both pairs of earbuds come with interchangeable tips in small, medium or large. Fit will vary depending on your ear shape and size, but I've had trouble with both these models not staying in properly when I'm working out or moving around a lot. I've actually found the most secure fit with third-party foam tips for the AirPods Pro -- I use ones from Comply, but there are many other brands available. The Galaxy Bud Pro tips don't come with the wingtip locks found in previous models like the Galaxy Buds Plus that helped lock them securely in your ear. I haven't been able to find third-party tips for the Galaxy Buds Pro yet, but I'm looking forward to seeing if that will improve the fit.

The Galaxy Buds Pro have the upper hand when it comes to durability against water and sweat, with a higher rating of IPX7 compared with the IPX4 of the AirPods Pro. This means they can be submerged in up to 3 feet (1 meter) of fresh water for up to 30 minutes. I haven't taken the Buds Pro for a swim yet or run them through the washer, but I've had no problems after splashing some water on them. The AirPods Pro can withstand sweat and some light splashes, but I wouldn't suggest taking them swimming. If you're just looking for some headphones to work out in, both of these products fit the bill. 
The AirPods Pro with third-party eartips.
Both these earbuds sound good, as long as you can get a secure fit. It's definitely a matter of preference, but I prefer the warmer sound profile and more pronounced bass response of the Galaxy Bud Pro when it comes to sound quality. You can also adjust the equalizer manually in the Galaxy Wearable app to a number of different presets, from bass boost to soft. The AirPods Pro have a more neutral sound profile that actually works in their favor if you want to jump between calls, listening to music and listening to podcasts. They have an adaptive equalizer that dynamically adjusts the sound for you.
While both do a good job at canceling out ambient noise, the AirPods Pro are a touch more effective at drowning out white noise like the sound of an overhead fan or plane engines. While you can adjust the ANC level on the Galaxy Buds Pro to high or low, I didn't really hear any difference between the two settings. I can also hear a very faint hiss when I have ANC on the Buds Pro when I'm not listening to music.
They both have spatial audio (Samsung calls it 360 audio) for a simulated surround-sound experience when listening to movies and TV shows. Again, both sound good, but if I had to choose, I would go with the AirPods Pro as the effect sounds more natural. Note that at the time of writing, 360 audio support is only on Samsung devices running One UI 3.1 like the Samsung Galaxy S21 phones, whereas spatial audio on the AirPods Pro is available on any Apple device running iOS 14 or later.
But the Galaxy Buds Pro have a feature the AirPods Pro lack: voice detection. The Galaxy Buds Pro automatically lowers the volume of your media when they detect that you're talking and then reverts back to your original settings 10 seconds after you've stopped. It's great if you want to be able to have a quick conversation without actively switching the buds into ambient sound mode (or pulling one out of your ear). 
You can listen to mic samples in our video on this page to hear the difference for calls.
Samsung quotes the battery life on the Galaxy Buds Pro at 5 hours with ANC on, but I never got close to that figure. With ANC turned on, the longest I was able to wear them for was roughly 4.5 hours, which was disappointing considering the claim. Apple quotes up to 4.5   hours with ANC for the AirPods Pro, but I regularly exceeded that and could manage almost 5 hours of total listening time. According to Samsung, the Buds Pro can also last up to 8 hours of listening time without ANC, but again, I wasn't able to reach that number myself.
Each case also holds a little extra charge, with the AirPods Pro offering 24 hours' total juice and the Galaxy Buds Pro an added 18 hours. Both cases can wirelessly charge, or you can plug in Lightning on the AirPods Pro or USB-C on the Galaxy Buds Pro.

This is the first generation of Samsung earbuds I've tested that aren't compatible with the Galaxy Wearable iOS app. This means they'll connect to an iPhone via Bluetooth and you can activate ANC and use the default tap controls, but you won't be able to change the settings. The AirPods Pro also work as regular Bluetooth earbuds on Android, but offer the most seamless experience customizing settings on iOS.
You can summon Siri on the AirPods Pro, or Bixby on the Galaxy Buds Pro by using your voice, or with touch controls. Each will read off text messages or notifications, and let you change the volume or place a call with your voice. There is no way to call on Google Assistant using your voice on the Galaxy Buds Pro yet, although you can activate Google Assistant on the Galaxy Buds Pro by assigning it as a long press of the touch panel, but you can't make calls with it yet. 
Each earbud can be used independently for calls or listening to music and you can find both on a map if you lose them using the Find My app on iPhone or the Smart Things app on Galaxy devices. They both also offer fast switching between devices signed in to the same Apple ID or Samsung account.

Both sets of earbuds have their strengths, but the best earbuds for you will ultimately depend on what software ecosystem you're in. Previous Samsung-versus-Apple earbud comparisons were more platform-agnostic, given earlier models were compatible with the Galaxy Wearable app on iOS, but this time your phone will be a big factor in your decision. I prefer the warm sound profile of the Galaxy Buds Pro, so I'd pick these for listening to music. But for multitasking between calls and music (and for more reliable battery performance), I choose the AirPods Pro."
iPhone 12 Pro Max vs. iPhone XS Max: What big changes did Apple make in 2020?,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-12-pro-max-vs-iphone-xs-max-what-big-changes-apple-made-in-2020/,"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    We compare the major differences between the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the iPhone XS Max, besides 5G.
  
Back in October, 
  Apple
 introduced the 
  iPhone 12 Pro Max
, along with its three siblings in the first virtual-only 
  iPhone
 event. There are plenty of superlatives that could describe the iPhone 12 Pro Max: the iPhone with the largest ever screen (6.7 inches), the iPhone with the most durable screen (alongside its siblings) and possibly even the iPhone with the longest battery life. 
Two years ago, the 
  iPhone XS Max
 held many of those exact titles. So if you've been holding onto an iPhone XS Max, you're probably wondering what additions Apple has packed into the iPhone 12 Pro Max (beyond 
  5G
 support) and whether it's worth the cash to go for an upgrade. Apple made the expected incremental upgrades to things like its processor and software (scroll down to our specs chart for specifics), but there are some key changes you'll want to consider before making the decision to upgrade or wait for Apple's next-gen iPhone in 2021.
As Apple's fanciest phone available, getting the iPhone 12 Pro Max means you'll get the very best overall photo and video quality of any iPhone. But it'll also allow for more versatile photography compared to the iPhone XS Max. While each iPhone has wide and telephoto lenses, the iPhone 12 Pro Max has an extra lens taking the form of an ultra-wide shooter. That ultra-wide lens is crucial for taking photos of sweeping landscapes or even if you want to take a zoomed-out photo of, say, your living room. 
The iPhone XS Max's dual rear camera module has a 12-megapixel wide-angle lens and a 12-megapixel telephoto lens.
In addition, the iPhone 12 Pro Max has a longer telephoto lens than the iPhone XS Max. At a 65-millimeter equivalent, the new telephoto lens on the 
  12 Pro
 Max has a 2.5x optical zoom. Compare that to the iPhone XS Max's 2x zoom (52-millimeter equivalent) telephoto lens and that extra 0.5x can go a long way. The iPhone 12 Pro Max (along with the iPhone 12 Pro) has a lidar sensor too, which helps with auto-focus in low-light for photos, videos and slow motion. I'll go into more depth on the tech later. If you're looking for specific details about the camera, feel free to scroll down to our specs chart at the bottom of this article.
While both devices rely on similar-sized OLED panels, Apple added a ceramic-hardened glass display, called Ceramic Shield, to its iPhone 12 line. Apple says its ceramic shielding, which covers the front of the device, offers four times better drop protection. Although it's tough to verify that claim, we can conclude, based on our drop tests, that it's indeed a durable shielding. Admittedly, we haven't put the iPhone 12 Pro Max itself through the paces yet, but CNET's Vanessa Hand Orellana did conduct tests on the iPhone 12, which uses the same screen. In her tests, the iPhone 12's screen survived without a crack after it was dropped six times on a sidewalk, including three back-to-back drops from a height of 9 feet.  
For its part, the iPhone XS Max seems to be a durable phone too. According to CNET's drop test results, the 
  iPhone XS
, which uses the same screen as its pricier sibling, survived four drops on a cement sidewalk from a height of 3 feet and 5 feet. 
The iPhone 12 Pro Max's sleeper feature is its large battery, according to CNET's Patrick Holland, who reviewed the device. Although Apple doesn't reveal battery size, the company's website says the 12 Pro Max should last 20 hours playing a looped video on airplane mode. In Patrick's test, it got exceedingly close to that duration, lasting 19 hours, 52 minutes. Meanwhile, the iPhone XS Max lasted 17 hours, 23 minutes, which is an impressive feat in its own right. Whether that extra hour and a half matters will likely come down to personal preference or your phone-use habits. 
Apple confirmed the fears of some iPhone fans when it announced that the iPhone 12 wouldn't come with either a wall adapter or wired earphones. While the company is betting many of its customers already have those accessories, Apple's reasoning to leave behind the wall adapter may also have something to do with its introduction of MagSafe. It's a proprietary wireless charging system that relies on magnets and it lets you snap on magnetic accessories like chargers and wallets onto your device's rear. Apple's $38 MagSafe charge is one such accessory you can buy separately, but there are many more to choose from and the selection is rapidly growing. 
As for the iPhone XS Max, it comes with a Lightning cable and plug and it also works with the existing Qi wireless charging standard. 
Examples of some magnetic accessories you can snap onto the back of your iPhone 12 Pro Max.
Peer closely at the iPhone 12 Pro Max (and the iPhone 12 Pro) and you'll see a little black dot near the camera lenses: That's the lidar sensor. It uses infrared lasers to measure an object's distance, based on how long it takes for the light to get back to the sensor. Lidar, which stands for light detection and ranging, isn't anything new, however. The depth-sensing tech has already made its way to 
  self-driving cars
, 
  drones
 and robotics, but it's the first time the tech has appeared on an iPhone.
What the inclusion of lidar means for the iPhone 12 Pro Max is that it helps improve your device's camera features like taking blurry-background shots in night mode and low-light focus. But you can also use it to accurately measure things and even create 3D maps of a room. To learn more about how lidar works and what direction it's headed in, check this article out.

Now that we've gone through many of the major differences between the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone XS Max, it's time to share our buying advice on whether to go for the upgrade. The short answer is: If you've already invested in the iPhone XS Max, it might be worth it to wait until next year. But if you're having battery or performance problems, then you may want to consider that upgrade. The logic is this: While MagSafe, a ceramic-hardened display and an improved camera system are indeed noteworthy changes, I'd argue they're nice-to-have additions rather than need-to-have ones. The iPhone XS Max is already a fantastic all-rounder capable of lasting you through the day and capturing wonderful photos. You'd really only need the upgrade if you're having battery or performance issues."
Apple ProRaw can transform your iPhone photography. Here's how,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-iphone-12-proraw-can-transform-phone-photography-heres-how/,"Sun, 21 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    As a professional photographer, I'm all-in on ProRaw.
  
Apple's 
  iPhone 12 Pro Max
 has already proven itself to pack one of the 
  best cameras
 it's possible to get on a phone. The addition of ProRaw takes it further, though, and makes this phone camera an even bigger rival to professional DSLRs. I'm a professional photographer, and I spent some time with ProRaw in beta form on the 12 Pro Max before it officially launched in iOS 14.3. I shoot in raw all the time in my professional work, and Apple's ProRaw, even in its beta form, has allowed me to work with images from my 
  iPhone
 exactly as I would with images from my pro DSLR. I'm very impressed.
ProRaw is Apple's version of the raw files that pros typically use on DSLRs. They're called raw because unlike JPEG images they don't save information about color, sharpening or other effects applied by the camera. They usually result in a more natural base image to postprocess in software such as Adobe 
  Lightroom
 or Photoshop. ProRaw works in much the same way, but unlike DNG raw files you can take in third-party apps, ProRaw makes use of Apple's computational photography for deep fusion HDR. The result is a better-looking base image that still gives a lot more flexibility for editing than you'd get with JPEG images. 
On paper, it's the perfect compromise, and in practice it's proven to be so for many of my images. Let's take a look at some.
Let's start with this evening landscape shot in standard JPEG. It's fine, but the shadows have been lifted to such an extent that a lot of the contrast and mood has gone and there's a lot of oversharpening. As a snap, it's fine, but it's not a good starting point for a more artistic edit. 
Here's the same shot, taken a few seconds later in ProRaw and then edited in Lightroom. I've been able to keep those shadows darker, maintaining the evening mood, while also having full control to correct the white balance and add much less sharpening to avoid messing up the fine details on the image. I've edited it with a moodier style that I really like -- it might not be to everyone's tastes, but it shows that these edits on iPhone shots are possible. 
And here's what happens if I copy those exact edit settings I made from the ProRaw image onto that JPEG. Clearly, it hasn't worked.
A short time later the sky erupted in an incredible sunset. I've captured it here in JPEG and while the image looks decent enough, the vibrant sky looks a bit ""burnt in"" and there's again a lot of sharpening in the image which overall doesn't give me a good base image for a proper edit.
The ProRaw version gave me a lot more scope to control the vibrance of the sky, as well as the overall white balance and color tones. I'm really pleased with how this image has turned out, and I could only have got it to this point by shooting in raw over JPEG. But editing the shot was still around 15 minutes of work in Lightroom, so it's not the quickest way of working. 
The straight-out-of-camera ProRaw file doesn't always look great and likely will look a lot worse than the JPEG version. ProRaw files, just like raw files from a DSLR, will need work and processing before they look their best. 
Take this unprocessed ProRaw file, for example, which I imported in Lightroom and then exported as a JPEG without any editing. It looks way too dark. 
But after spending some time in Lightroom I've been able to bring back all of that detail, while still maintaining the bright sky. It gave me a great base image to adjust the color tones to get the finished shot you see here and it's a shot I'm really pleased with. It's certainly a big change from the untouched raw version. 
It's worth remembering, though, that I've been using ProRaw in beta form, and Adobe is yet to update Lightroom to properly support the files. I've noticed that ProRaw files that look good in the photo gallery suddenly look overly dark -- or sometimes overly bright -- when opened in Lightroom, as well as in some other editing apps like Snapseed. It's difficult to say why this is, exactly, but it means that I've had to work a bit harder to get the image back to a ""good"" place before I then start editing more creatively. The information has been captured however, which is how I've been able to lift the shadows in this example so well. 
Some of you reading this might not love the idea of spending so much time editing a single image, but spending that time is common in professional photography to ensure an image comes out absolutely perfectly. I'll frequently spend half an hour or more on a single landscape image, and my product and car photographs may well take multiple hours of work. It's a slower process, but the resulting quality is much higher. 
Here's another before and after example. On the left is the unprocessed ProRaw file. On the right is how I've edited it in Lightroom. The file has had a lot of scope to let me raise the shadows while also controlling that extremely bright sky. I've also used location adjustment brushes to ""paint"" light into some of the leaves, to help them stand out more in the scene, and I've tweaked the color balance throughout. This is exactly how I would process the image using a raw file from a 
  Canon
 5DMkIV DSLR, and I'm super impressed at how this final image looks. 
While you've been able to shoot in regular DNG raw through third-party apps for a while, they don't use Apple's HDR blending, so being able to balance highlights and shadows like this was tricky. ProRaw has been noticeably easier to work with.
It's not always about huge, transformational edits. This shot involved darkening the scene to capture more of the moody sky, and enhancing that gorgeous rainbow. 
While this shot just needed some shadow lifting and color toning and some darkening of the sky, it doesn't look a whole lot different from the original. 
ProRaw works with night mode too -- another benefit over regular raw in a third-party app, which can't use night mode. Here, I've benefited from the bright shots night mode can take in the dark, but I've still had full control over white balance and color tone, while also having more accurate control over the highlights and shadows. Original ProRaw is on the left, with my edited version on the right.
I've been able to bring out more shadow detail in this night image.
While being able to lift the shadows and control the bright highlights from the Christmas lights in this scene. 
Whether you should use it yourself depends very much on the style of your photography. If you're more about snapping and quickly sharing those moments with family and friends, then you should probably stick to JPEG. ProRaw shots demand editing work to bring out their best, just like any other raw file. Bear in mind too that ProRaw files are many times larger than JPEGs (around 3.5MB for the JPEG versus around 18MB for the ProRaw) so you'll quickly fill up your storage if you only shoot in raw. 
But if you take a more artistic approach to your photography and want to make sure you have full control over the image for accurate post production in apps like Lightroom, then you should absolutely give it a try. 
I use polarizers and neutral density filters on my DSLR when taking landscape shots, I accurately set up my tripod on location for my landscapes, and I love spending hours in Lightroom tweaking shots until I'm happy. So I'm used to a longer process in taking an image. For me, it's about crafting that perfect shot from start to finish, and ProRaw lets me do exactly that with shots from my iPhone, resulting in images that look better than their JPEG or standard raw counterparts can achieve. 
It's early days, though, and while I've found some beta issues with how the images look in Lightroom, I'm excited about how it'll improve and how ProRaw will help me shoot even better images from my phone.

iPhone 12 Pro Max vs. Galaxy S21 Ultra: Apple's and Samsung's luxe phones compared,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-12-pro-max-vs-galaxy-s21-ultra-apples-and-samsungs-phones-compared/,"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    The iPhone 12 Pro Max and the Galaxy S21 Ultra are among Apple's and Samsung's most luxurious phones yet. Here's how the two smartphone royals stack up against each other.
  
The iPhone 12 Pro Max and the Galaxy S21 Ultra have arrived, representing the crown jewels in Apple and Samsung's respective flagship lines. Each device is stacked with the top-of-the-line features reserved for smartphone royalty: blazing-fast processors, crystalline displays, versatile cameras and long-lasting batteries. 
As expected, neither comes cheap. The iPhone 12 Pro Max will set you back $1,099 (£1,329, AU$1,849) and the Galaxy S21 Ultra is $1,200 (£1,099, AU$1,849). You won't find a bundled charger inside either box.
It's clear both Apple and Samsung have outdone themselves, but the phone that's best for you will depend on your individual wants and needs. Let's talk through the major features and compare the key specs. 
Both the iPhone 12 Pro Max and Galaxy S21 Ultra take some of the best mobile photographs that money can buy. Each boast excellent cameras capable of capturing sweeping landscapes, detailed faraway subjects and impossibly crisp images, even on dark nights. But the S21 Ultra produced superior zoomed-in shots, while the iPhone captured the most realistic images, according to CNET's Andrew Hoyle, a pro photographer who conducted a comprehensive shootout with both phones (watch his video below). When it came to night mode, his tests indicated no clear winner.
Keep in mind, the iPhone 12's Pro models also have lidar, a depth sensor that's useful for auto-focusing in low light for taking photos, videos and slow-motion footage, among other things. 
The iPhone 12 Pro Max has three rear cameras consisting of a standard, ultra-wide and telephoto, while the S21 Ultra has an extra telephoto lens making a total of four rear cameras. On the front, the S21 Ultra has a higher-res camera than the 12 Pro Max. For specifics, scroll down to our chat below. 
The Galaxy S21 Ultra (seen in black) features a quad rear camera module.
Apple doesn't disclose battery size for its iPhones, and stuck to the same approach for the iPhone 12 Pro Max. But CNET's Patrick Holland, who reviewed the device, calls the 12 Pro Max's battery its ""sleeper feature."" According to his tests, the battery made it through a day and a half without a problem. More specifically, when Patrick played a looped video on airplane mode, the iPhone 12 Pro Max lasted 19 hours, 52 minutes, close enough to the 20 hours of performance for this test that Apple has advertised. Meanwhile, a 5,000-mAh battery supplies the S21 Ultra with juice. We haven't had a chance to put it through the video loop test, but anecdotally it also lasted Patrick a day and half. 
Although both phones feature premium OLED panels that are wonderfully crisp, the S21 Ultra has the edge in terms of resolution and refresh rate. The S21 Ultra has a wide quad-HD-plus resolution (3,200x1,440 pixels) and a 120 Hz display. The iPhone 12 Pro Max's screen is 2,778x1,284 pixels and has a 60Hz refresh rate, matching the iPhone 11 display. 
The S21 Ultra also has a variable refresh rate between 10 and 120Hz, which is determined by what's on the screen. The number of hertz a phone screen is able to display refers to its number of frames per second, which determines how fast and smooth the screen feels when you're scrolling through apps and web pages. It also affects how smooth supported games feel. 
Apple and Samsung both have unique add-on accessories that, if used, can change your day-to-day experience with the devices. The S21, for example, supports Samsung's S Pen stylus, which blurs the line between the S series and the more pro Note series. It's great for things like note-taking, drawing and signing documents. 
The iPhone 12 Pro Max, along with its three siblings, have MagSafe, Apple's proprietary magnetically enabled system that lets you charge your iPhone wirelessly and attach MagSafe accessories to the back of the device.
For a spec-by-spec comparison of the Galaxy S21 Ultra and the iPhone 12 Pro Max, take a look at the specs sheet below. "
Best Nest and Google Assistant Devices for 2024,https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/best-google-assistant-nest-devices/,"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 22:42:08 GMT",CNET,"

    Make the best of that Hey, Google prompt with these great Google Assistant-compatible smart home devices.
  
CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise.
CNET’s expert staff reviews and rates dozens of new products and services each month, building on more than a quarter century of expertise.
At one point in time, Google Assistant only worked with four smart home brands -- today, that number stands at over 10,000. We're truly living in the future as smart home devices continue to make everything as easy as a touch of a button or a spoken word. However, with this increase in products comes the trouble of choosing hardware that provides a seamless experience.
But fret not! If you're ready to jump in with a Google-powered smart home this holiday gifting season, we have found the best Google Nest devices and Google Assistant-compatible smart home products. Get started with a smart display or smart speaker, then branch out with our picks for compatible LED lights, door locks, smart switches, smart thermostats and other helpful gadgets. There's something for every smart home enthusiast on our list, so check out our top picks below to find your new favorite smart gadget.
Read more: The Exact Cost of Setting Up a Google Assistant Smart Home
The Google Nest Hub (formerly the Home Hub) is a great way to kick off a Google-centric smart home. It uses Google Assistant to respond to all of the same voice commands as a Google Home smart speaker. The touchscreen will show you extra info when you ask about the weather, search for restaurants and so on. Plus, you can use this smart home hub to watch videos or scroll through family pictures.
In fact, unique adaptive brightness sensors make the Nest Hub a great digital photo frame, as it adapts to both light levels and color temperature so it always looks like a physical photo in a frame. You can set it to play a scrolling slideshow of family pics as your screensaver. Google's Soli is also onboard this second-gen model for Sleep Sensing and Quick Gestures like pausing media with an air tap in front of the display. 
The Nest Hub is also a great kitchen helper, as it can walk you through recipes step by step and you can multitask while you cook. Set a timer, play music, add an ingredient to your shopping list -- the Nest Hub will even keep your place in the recipe when you need to check it next. You can plug it in and set it up on your Wi-Fi network  using the Google Home app and   ask the Google Nest Hub any question you'd ask the original Google Home. 
All of these voice control features make the Nest Hub useful in a lot of ways, but a simple control panel makes it the best choice for your central connected home device. Swipe down from the top for shortcuts that turn off the lights or let you check your smart home security cameras. You can then tap to see a room-by-room (living room, kitchen, etc.) overview of all of your devices. The control panel is well organized and helpful, particularly if you have family members who struggle to remember how to phrase voice commands. Now, they can just tap. 
The Nest Hub is our favorite smart display overall and boasts a reasonable $100 price. It's useful even if you don't have a lot of smart home gadgets, but it's indispensable if you want a smart home that works with Google Assistant.
If having an extra screen in your house would annoy you, the Google Nest Mini makes another good smart home starting point. Google's small smart speaker is now in its second generation and offers all of the same Google Assistant-enabled voice commands as the rest, plus helpful extras like intercom functionality and stereo pairing with multiple Minis. Control compatible gadgets, search the web, play music and use its other features just by asking. The audio quality of the Nest Mini is surprisingly good, especially in this second-gen model. 
The Nest Mini is also cute and comes in four colors (though Coral is currently out of stock). At $49, it's the least expensive way to try smart home features without sacrificing in voice control. The Nest Mini also makes for a good secondary device. If you put a Google Nest Hub in your kitchen, you can put a Nest Mini in a different room, and both will be able to control any compatible smart devices you set up. Even if they both hear you, only the closest one will respond.
Changing the temperature of your thermostat with a voice command is a cool trick that never really gets old. Lots of smart thermostats work with Google Assistant. Check out our smart thermostat best list for options. Since Google owns Nest, the third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat is the obvious choice here, but I'll give the nod to the Ecobee3 Lite. 
Ecobee's budget model and its companion app (for iOS and Android) offer most of the same smarts as more expensive competing models, including the $250 Nest thermostat. It responds to all of the same voice commands and the intuitive controls make manual scheduling easy.
The Wyze Cam is easy to recommend. It's affordable, it works well, cloud storage is free for 14 days -- and you have the option to use a microSD card for local storage if you want. 
In a side-by-side comparison between the previous-gen Wyze Cam and the recent model, we could  clearly see improved performance. Not only does it have a larger field of view, but the new camera also has a brighter, crisper live feed, which helps it out in low-light conditions as well as in regular daylight.
If you pay for the new Cam Plus subscription service, you get access to person alerts and longer stored video clips, starting at $2 per month. Sure, there are more sophisticated cameras out there, but Wyze continues to impress us with its high-value, low-cost smart home products, and this Wyze Cam for under $40 is no exception.
The Arlo Pro 4 is an excellent outdoor security camera with solid performance and versatility. With a slew of strong features, dependable design and a competitive subscription service, the Pro 4 is our favorite outdoor camera of 2024. At its retail price of $200, it isn't the most affordable device on the market, but it's available for a lot less online. 
The Pro 4 is both fancy and practical. Some of its best features include 2K resolution, a 160-degree field of view, full-color night vision (though it shifts to black and white in truly low-light settings), two-way talk, a built-in siren and motion-sensitive spotlight -- the works. It's easy to set up and use, and unlike the Arlo Pro 3, the Pro 4 connects directly to your Wi-Fi. The only downside is a lack of features without the subscription, but at $3 per month it's reasonable and in-line with competitors. 
SimpliSafe's wide variety of accessories rival professional options from companies like ADT. The starter kit is a reasonable $245 (and sometimes lower during sales). Unfortunately, you have to pay for remote app access, but $28 a month nets you that and professional monitoring. 
With the $28 monthly subscription, you also can control your system with Google Assistant, and SimpliSafe's devices will respond quickly to your voice commands. 
Again, Nest has an option here that poses a viable alternative. The Nest Guard costs more up front, but you can do much more without a subscription. But thanks to all of the reliable accessories, SimpliSafe's kit edges out the Nest Guard, especially if you want monitoring.
Speaking of locking down your home, the easy-to-install August Wi-Fi Smart Lock fits over your existing deadbolt. Built-in Wi-Fi lets you control it remotely and with voice recognition, so you can tell Google Assistant to lock your door. 
The August Wi-Fi Smart Lock has lots of features, including open-close sensors so you can check to make sure you pulled the door shut on your way out. August is responsive and reliable as well, making the Wi-Fi Smart Lock a good choice if you want to put Google Assistant in charge of your smart lock, door and entryway.
Wrapping this up with another one from Nest,  the Nest Doorbell is a top-notch wireless device with excellent specs and unique perks. While its predecessor Nest Hello (now called the Nest Doorbell (wired)) is still available for purchase, the battery-powered option has a more impressive design and better performance, making it an upgrade on almost every level. 
The Nest Doorbell with battery is an affordable $180 and offers a slew of neat features: two-way talk, high-def resolution, a 145-degree field of view with a 3:4 aspect ratio, smart alerts, facial recognition and a few other cool perks. And for icing on the cake, many of these best features come right out of the box -- no monthly subscription to Nest Aware necessary. 
While there are some video doorbells I like more (namely the Arlo Wire-Free), the Nest Doorbell (battery) is a solid device. If you're a Google loyalist or shopping for a wireless device with smart features without the monthly fees, then this video doorbell might be for you. 
Once you set up control points with a smart display or a smart speaker, it's time to figure out what smart devices you want. A smart light bulb is a good first step, and the Wyze Bulb White works particularly well with Google. 
We've found that these affordable Wi-Fi smart bulbs are more reliable than Bluetooth rivals like the C by GE. At $17 for two, just screw them in, turn them on, pair them with the Wyze mobile app and bask in the glow of dirt-cheap smart light.
A smart plug is a great way to efficiently add connectivity to dumb devices. Plug in a lamp or fan, and you'll be able to control it with an app. The TP-Link Kasa Smart Plug offers smartphone app controls and Google Assistant compatibility. Plus, the design is attractive and doesn't block adjacent outlets. 
It won't monitor energy, but the smart plug lets you control an old-fashioned floor fan with your voice for a reasonable price. Like most smart plugs, it works with a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network connection."
iPhone 12 Pro vs. S21 Plus: Key specs compared between Apple and Samsung's phones,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-12-pro-vs-s21-plus-key-specs-compared/,"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    If you're looking for a premium phone, these two are almost definitely on your list. Here's how they stack up.
  
At $1,000 a pop, the 
  iPhone
 12 Pro and the Galaxy S21 Plus pack some of the best hardware and software in a phone that money can buy. So, which device is better suited to your needs? Here are some of the key differences to keep in mind before you pull the trigger.
In the United States, the S21 Plus comes equipped with 
  Qualcomm's
 latest Snapdragon 888, which is the go-to chipset many Android manufacturers use to power their latest flagships. 
  Apple
 makes its own chips and has crammed its latest A14 Bionic processor into all four iPhone 12 models, including the 12 Pro. Although each chipset is at the top of its game, Apple's A14 has an edge based on reported third-party benchmark tests. In day-to-day use, however, most would be hard-pressed to spot the difference.
It's tough to make an outright call without first putting the 
  phones
 through a shootout (as we have done with the higher-end and base-level models). But even if we did put the cameras through the paces, calling out a winner isn't so straightforward as each phone has its own unique strengths.
In general, the pro models of the S21 line have better zoom chops than the higher-end iPhone 12s. For instance, the S21 Pro has a dedicated 64-megapixel telephoto camera that can zoom to a 30x magnification, while the iPhone 12 Pro, which has a fantastic telephoto camera, maxes out at 12x. 
The iPhone 12 Pro takes superb photographs day or night. Apple has added a new photo format called ProRaw, which means the camera can take shots that give traditional DSLRs a run for their money. CNET's Stephen Shankland is a big fan of Apple's ProRaw technology, saying it lets him achieve a look that's more ""pleasing and natural"" than he can get with the standard JPEG or HEIC photos most camera phones produce. 

  Samsung
 reduced screen resolution by half on the S21 and S21 Plus, as it tried to save on costs given the lowered starting price. The iPhone 12 Pro has the higher-res display but the Galaxy S21 Plus touts a faster refresh rate of 120Hz, which makes for a silky smooth experience when scrolling through social media feeds and navigating between apps. Before launch it was speculated that the iPhone 12 lineup would have a 120Hz screen refresh rate -- double that of the iPhone 11. But that didn't turn out to be the case: The iPhone 12 variants all have a 60Hz screen refresh rate, matching the iPhone 11 display. 
Neither the S21 Plus or the iPhone 12 Pro have bundled chargers anymore, but Apple's magnetically enabled system lets you charge your iPhone 12 Pro with a so-called MagSafe charger (sold separately). You can also attach all kinds of accessories to the back of the device, opening up new possibilities and practical applications. CNET's Roger Cheng called MagSafe the iPhone 12 family's sleeper feature that could outshine 5G. For any other differences, take a look at our specs chart below.

Apple Pay Cash on your iPhone is easy to use and set up,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/apple-pay-cash-iphone-is-easy-to-use-and-set-up/,"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Here's how to set up and use Apple Cash in your Apple Pay wallet to send, receive and request money on both your iPhone and Apple Watch.
  
If you're using 
  Apple Pay
 on your 
  iPhone
 or 
  Apple Watch
, you might wonder about the tiny black Apple Pay oval at the bottom of your Messages app. Or perhaps a friend sent you money with Apple Cash and you want to know what you can do with it. I'm going to walk you through setting up and using Apple Cash in your Apple Pay wallet to send, receive and request money as well as transfer cash into your bank account.
With Apple Cash, Apple Pay and the Apple Card -- also known as Apple's credit card -- it can be confusing to know what each does and doesn't do. Apple Cash is tied to your Apple Pay and lets you make purchases in stores, apps and on the web. You can also transfer the money you have on Apple Cash to your bank account. It's similar to the way Venmo and the Cash app by Square works, except it's tied to your Apple ID.
You can send people money with Apple Cash and people can send you money, which is automatically and securely kept on your Apple Cash card. However, there's not an actual physical card, just a metaphorical one. If you want to follow along step by step, check out the video above.
You can send, receive and request money with Apple Cash. It works like Venmo and the Cash app from Square.
Let's start by setting up Apple Cash on your phone. 
Open the Wallet app on your phone. If you already have Apple Pay set up you'll see the black Apple Cash card. By the way, if you tilt and pan your phone, the colored circular pattern on the card will change colors. There is no practical use for this feature aside from being entertaining. 
1. Tap the card, and then select Set Up Now. 
2. On the next screen, tap Continue. After a moment, the Apple Cash is Set Up window will pop up. 
3. Hit Continue. If you don't have a debit card on your phone, you'll be prompted to add one. If you choose to not add one, you can add it later but won't be able to send money because you don't have any.
If you don't have Apple Pay already set up take a look at CNET's how to set up Apple Pay article to get started.
1. To send cash, open up the Messages app and then go into a conversation or start a new one. 
2. Tap the Apple Pay button below the message field. If you don't see it tap the Apps icon to reveal it.
3. Next, tap the plus or minus buttons to add the amount you want to send. 
4. Then, if you want, add a message to go with the payment. 
5. When you're ready to send, tap the black circle with a white arrow.
You can use Apple Cash to pay people through the Messages app on your iPhone.
By default, any money you already have in Apple Cash will be used to make the payment first. Otherwise, if you don't have any money, the debit card tied to your phone will be charged.
Apple Cash isn't just limited to your phone. You can also use it on your Apple Watch. 
1. In Messages, scroll down, then tap the Apple Pay button. 
2. Turn the Digital Crown to add or subtract money. 
3. Then tap Pay. 
By the way, you can also use 
  Siri
 to pay someone with Apple Cash. Simply trigger Siri and say, ""Siri, Apple Pay 80 dollars to Eric Franklin.""
You can also use it to request money. For example, if you bought tickets to a movie for yourself and a friend, you can request the money they owe you. 
1. From Messages tap the Apple Pay button. 
2. Next, enter an amount and then tap Request. You don't have to, but it's probably a good idea to add a message. 
3. When you're done hit Send. 
Next, comes the fun part: when someone sends you money. When you receive Apple Cash from someone, it's automatically received and kept in Apple Cash by default. If you have your Apple Cash card setup you can use your balance to make purchases in apps, online and in stores. Otherwise, you can transfer Apple Cash into your bank account. 
You can transfer any Apple Cash you have to your bank.
1. Open the Wallet app and tap on Apple Cash. 
2. On the next screen, tap the black circle at the top of the screen. 
3. Then locate and tap the Transfer to Bank button. 
4. Enter the amount you want to send and hit Next. 
5. Then choose 1-3 Business Days. If you don't have a bank account set up, follow the instructions on your screen to add one. 
6. Next, you need to confirm with Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode. Then, comes the worst part: waiting for the money to transfer.
If you have a Visa debit card tied to Apple Pay you can use instant transfer to get the money into your bank account fast. After you tap Transfer to Bank, hit Instant Transfer. Next, select the Visa debit card you want to transfer money to and the billing information. Your funds should transfer within 30 minutes. You might be charged a 1% fee to use instant transfer.
There might be a time when you need to cancel an Apple Cash payment. For example, if you sent someone money who hasn't accepted, you might want to cancel it and pay them via a different method. 
1. Open Messages and go to the payment or find the payment on the Latest Transactions screen underneath Apple Cash card in the Wallet app. 
2. Tap the payment to see its details, then check the status field. 
3. From there, tap Cancel Payment. The status field should update to read Canceled. If you don't see the option to cancel, then the person has already accepted the payment. In which case you'll need to ask the person to send money back to you.
Apple Cash is a really convenient albeit complex system. Once you have the basics set up, you should be good to go."

Apple will continue providing existing HomePods with software updates and support through Apple Care, the company said.
The HomePod Mini was launched in November last year, costing $99 in comparison with the $300 HomePod original. When it was released in 2018, CNET reviewer Megan Wollerton praised its ""stellar"" sound but said it didn't offer as many features as competing speakers powered by Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant. ""If you and everyone else you live with has an Apple device and you're sold on having an Apple smart home, the HomePod is worth a close look,"" she wrote at the time. 
The HomePod Mini earned similarly strong praise from CNET reviewer Molly Price for its sound when it was released in 2020, with a note that the lower price made it much more attractive. ""The HomePod Mini is as on-par as Apple wants to make it with Google and Amazon's offerings, and I'd recommend it to anyone invested in the Apple universe,"" she wrote.
The news about the original HomePod's demise was reported earlier Friday by TechCrunch."

    A new edition of the wearable could include better impact resistance and a rubberized exterior, sources tell Bloomberg. But they also say it's still a ways off.
  
Girding for combat?

  Apple
 may be working on an all-new variation of its industry-leading 
  Apple Watch
, which could include a more rugged casing that's designed specifically for people who indulge in extreme sports such as rock climbing. That's according to a Saturday report from Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter.
The new Apple Watch variant is sometimes called the Explorer Edition at the company, the report says, and it could feature a rubberized shell and offer greater impact resistance than the current models, which include the flagship Apple Watch, the lower-cost Apple Watch SE as well as branded editions from Hermes and 
  Nike
.
Bloomberg's sources said Apple has talked about introducing the Explorer Edition later in 2021 or in 2022, at the earliest. The sources also stress that, like any product still under development, this gadget could ultimately be canceled or delayed. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Your iPhone has a hidden document scanner. This is how to use it,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/your-iphone-has-a-hidden-document-scanner-this-is-how-to-use-it/,"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Don't fret the next time you're asked to scan a document -- just pick up your iPhone or iPad.
  
Your iPhone or iPad doubles as a document scanner. We'll show you where to look. 
If you don't own one of those fancy all-in-one printers that includes a scanner, being asked to sign, scan and send a document can seem like an impossible task. Not to mention a task from a decade ago. But you may have a scanner right in your hand: your iPhone or iPad. 
By scanning a document, I don't mean taking a picture and then cropping it -- that's more work than it's worth. Better to use the document scanner that's buried in the iPhone's Notes app. The feature was added in iOS 11 in 2017, but if you don't use Apple's Notes app, you don't know it's there. 
Below I'll show you where to find the scanner, how to use it and cover some general tips to get the most of the hidden feature. 
Place the document(s) on a flat surface, in a well-lit area. Open the Notes app and either create a new note or open an existing note. I created a folder called Scanned Documents where I can store and easily find anything I've scanned. 
With a note open, tap on the camera icon then Scan Documents. 
Your iPhone or iPad will open the camera, complete with a shutter button near the bottom of the screen. Don't push it yet; instead, follow the prompts on your screen. To get the best results, hold your device directly above the document. 
It's hidden under a few taps, but the option's definitely there. 
A yellow box will appear as the camera begins scanning and looking for the document. You'll see tips like ""get closer"" as your device looks for the edges and corners of the paper. Once it identifies the entire document, it will automatically capture a scan. If your iPhone is struggling to find the document, you can press the shutter button.
A small thumbnail of each page will show in the bottom-left corner, and the scanner will remain open to continue scanning multiple pages. When you're done, tap Save.
After you scan the document, you can make adjustments like defining the corners if the scan isn't quite right, change the color scheme, rotate the document or add more pages. 
Watching the Notes app scan and find a document's footprint is impressive. 
Tap on the document to open it, and you'll find all of the editing tools along the bottom of the screen. Use the crop tool to adjust the corners or cut out a section of the document if you don't want that information included. 
I've found the easiest way to use the crop tool is to place your finger near the small circle located on each corner of the document, each one doubling as a magnifying glass. That will give you a better view of your adjustments instead of covering them up. 
Now that you have a document scanned and adjusted, you have a few options. You can keep it in the Notes app for future reference, or you can sign and share it. 
There are plenty of tools and options for what you can do with your new scan. 
To bring up the share sheet when viewing a document, tap the share button in the top-right corner of the screen. To add your signature, scroll below the app shortcuts and tap Markup. The markup tool has tools to draw, write or add text or add your signature. Tap on the ""+"" sign to see all of the tools options. 
When you're done signing or annotating the document, you can then email it, save it to the Files app or treat it as you would any other document on your iPhone or iPad. 
Now that you know about Apple's hidden scanner feature, make sure to check out more hidden features we've found in iOS 14. If you'd rather deal with a scanned document on your Mac, here's how to scan the document with your iPhone and send it directly to your Mac.

    The Siri-enabled smart speaker could have some new features up its sleeve.
  
The Apple HomePod Mini may be getting new features.
Apple slipped a small sensor into the HomePod Mini that can measure the temperature and humidity in a room, according to a report Monday from Bloomberg. The component, which doesn't appear to have been previously disclosed, could help bolster Apple's smart-home ambitions. 
The HomePod Mini was launched in November, costing $99 in comparison with the $300 HomePod original. The Siri-powered smart speaker came with new features, including an intercom and stereo pairing. Earlier this month, Apple said it was discontinuing the original HomePod and focusing its efforts on the Mini.
Apple has internally discussed having the sensor send temperature and humidity readings to internet-connected thermostats, so adjustments can be made based on current conditions, according to Bloomberg. It could also reportedly let the HomePod Mini trigger actions, like turning on a fan, based on the temperature in a room. 
The temperature sensor is made by Texas Instruments, according to Bloomberg, and located along the bottom edge of the HomePod Mini near its power cable.

"Photoshop on Apple M1 MacBook 50% faster than on Intel models, Adobe says",https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/photoshop-on-apple-m1-macbook-50-faster-than-on-intel-models-adobe-says/,"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Adobe releases a version of its photo-editing software that runs natively on Macs powered by Apple's own processor.
  
Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Pro uses the company's M1 processor. Adobe released a version of Photoshop built for the new machines.

  Adobe
 on Wednesday released 
  Photoshop
 for Apple's M1-based Macs, a key software package for the new family of computers, and it runs 50% faster than on Intel-powered equivalent 
  laptops
. 
""Our internal tests show a wide range of features running an average of 1.5x the speed of similarly configured previous generation systems,"" Photoshop Product Manager Pam Clark said in a blog post Wednesday about the release of the M1-native Photoshop software. Those tests included opening and saving files, applying editing filters, and using automated tools for filling in regions and selecting subjects, ""which all feel noticeably faster,"" Adobe said. 
The results reinforce the strong performance and battery life advantages that reviewers have reported for Apple's new Macs -- and the serious challenge Apple poses to Intel after years of delays modernizing its manufacturing. Making a chip transition in computing product line is a massive endeavor, but so far it appears Apple has managed the change well. 
Good Photoshop performance is important for the creative professionals who are a core Mac customer set. Even before the native Photoshop version arrived, CNET photographer Andrew Hoyle declared M1 Macs to be a ""safe bet."" Photoshop is widely used for editing and compositing photos but also many other design and publishing tasks. 
M1 processors are more powerful siblings to Apple's A14 chips in new 
  iPhones
, and they take advantage of the circuitry miniaturization lead that TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.) has on 
  Intel
. 
Adobe ran its tests on 13-inch 
  MacBook
 Pros with 16GB of RAM, 2TB SSDs and Mac OS 11.2.2. The Intel-based machine used a Core i7 processor, though Macs don't ship with the latest models from Intel. Budget buyers should note that the M1-based MacBook Air likely offers similar performance. It lacks the Pro's larger battery, slightly brighter screen, cooling fan for sustained heavy work and, in low-end Air configurations, a bit of graphics processing performance. 
Apple has yet to release larger, more powerful 
  MacBook Pro


For its part, Intel in February offered its own set of speed tests showing where its newer 11th Gen Core chips, code-named Tiger Lake, outdo M1 Macs. (Apple's Intel-based MacBooks use 10th Gen Core chips.) One specific test involved Photoshop's content aware fill technology, one of the tests Adobe cited. On Intel's test, its Windows machine using a 3GHz quad-core Intel chip was 1.5 times faster than an M1 Mac. On that test, though, M1 was running Photoshop through Apple's Rosetta 2 translation software, which isn't as fast as running native software built for the chip. 
A few newer Photoshop features aren't yet in the new M1-native version, including the ability to edit documents stored in the cloud and to synchronize presets, Adobe said. Customers who need those can use the Intel version of Photoshop running on M1 Macs through Rosetta.  
There are no Windows PCs using M1 processors, although it's possible Apple's success with the M1 could spur Arm-family chip PC progress from Qualcomm or other chip designers. 
Also on Wednesday, Adobe announced a new Photoshop feature that uses AI to quadruple photo sizes. The feature will soon come to Lightroom, too. "
Transferring photos from iCloud to Google Photos is finally possible. Here's how,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/transferring-photos-from-icloud-to-google-photos-is-finally-possible-heres-how/,"Sat, 06 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Apple built a tool that will automatically transfer all of your pictures and videos from iCloud to Google.
  
Tired of iCloud Photos? You can ditch it for Google Photos with ease. 
If you have a lot of photos and videos stored in any cloud service, be it iCloud or Google Photos, it's easy to feel sort of stuck with that platform. Downloading lots of gigabytes of your precious memories and then uploading them to another service takes a lot of time, not to mention data if your internet service provider has a data cap.  
Read more: Google Photos is ending unlimited free storage. Here's what to do about it
There's good news for iCloud Photos users who want to make the switch to Google Photos: Apple now has a free tool that makes it easy to transfer your photos and videos.  
Even if you're not making the switch from iPhone to Android, you can use Apple's new tool to make a backup of your iCloud Photos library. Below I'll walk you through the requirements and the steps you'll need to follow.  
While the transfer tool is easy to use, taking just a few clicks of the mouse to begin the process, there are some things you'll need to be aware of before you start the transition.  
The requirements list on the Apple support page notes that in addition to using iCloud Photos to store your pictures and videos, your Apple ID will need to have two-factor authentication turned on. Additionally, you'll want to make sure your Google account has enough storage to handle the transfer.  
The new transfer tool is part of Apple's privacy site. 
The best part about the way Apple built its transfer tool is that you don't have to download all of your photos and videos, and then upload them to Google Photos separately. Instead, Apple takes care of the transfer after you connect your Apple ID and Google account.  
To start the transfer, you'll need to visit privacy.apple.com and sign in to the Apple ID linked to your iCloud Photos account. Next, click on Request to transfer a copy of your data under the Transfer a copy of your data section.  
Click the drop-down menu and pick Google Photos, and then click the two checkboxes that are displayed, one for photos, another for videos. Click Continue. Google Photos is the only option available right now, but it sure feels like this tool was built with the intention of adding more services.  
Apple will show you how much storage your photo library will use, and remind you to check your Google account and make sure you have enough space. If you don't have enough room, the transfer will stop and not everything will be copied over. Click Continue after you've checked your Google account's storage amount.  
Really, it's this easy. 
That said, Google Photos does allow you to keep an unlimited amount of photos and videos as long as you select ""high quality"" and not original; however, there isn't an option to select the quality in Apple's tool. Starting June 1, any new photos and videos uploaded to Google will count against your storage plan. You can sign in to Google Drive to see how much storage you have, and I'd also recommend signing in to your Google Photos account and checking your settings to see what quality your photos are being stored as.  
A pop-up window will ask you to sign in to your Google account and grant Apple access to your Google Photos library. Follow the prompts.  
When you're done, the transfer will begin. According to Apple, the process will take three to seven days to complete. When Apple has completed the transfer, you'll receive an email letting you know it's done.  
While it's not the quickest process, it is by far the easiest and most trustworthy tool I've seen. For someone who's jumped ship to Android, leaving the iPhone behind, what more can you ask for? Remember, Google is getting rid of free unlimited storage starting June 1, 2021, but photos or videos you transfer before that date won't count against the cap. "
15 tips and tricks to master your Apple Watch,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/15-tips-and-tricks-to-master-your-apple-watch/,"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    The Apple Watch is part fitness tracker, part miniature iPhone and entirely awesome.
  
The Apple Watch does more than just put notifications on your wrist. 
The Apple Watch's journey has been one of constant evolution. Originally positioned as an extension of your iPhone, putting apps and notifications on your wrist has slowly morphed into a full-out fitness device. Not only does it count your steps, but it can detect if you fall then call for help, monitor how noisy your environment is and even run an electrocardiogram -- directly on your wrist. Heck, there's even a chance that the Apple Watch, in combination with an app, can help prevent strokes.
As amazing as the medical features are, there's still plenty the Apple Watch can do that makes it almost like a miniature iPhone. For instance, you can install apps, interact with Siri, check the weather, sports scores or send a quick message. There's a lot to the Apple Watch, making it easy to miss features or settings, preventing you from using it to its full potential. 
Let's change that. Below I'll walk you through some basics, like how to keep the software up to date, how to use the James Bond-like Walkie-Talkie feature, run an ECG or point out settings you should change right away.

Update your watch. After unboxing your watch and pairing it to your 
  iPhone
, you'll want to ensure it's running the latest version of 
  WatchOS
 so you can take advantage of the newest features. Read this to learn how to get WatchOS 7.
Icons and apps. Curious as to what those small icons that flash on your watch's screen are? Or what about 
  Siri's
 Raise to Speak feature? We cover that, plus a handful of other tips.
After taking a dip, you need to get water out of the Apple Watch's speaker. 
Notifications are a key smartwatch feature, and it's a feature you'll want to learn how to tame. Notifications can get overwhelming, especially when your wrist is beeping and vibrating for every Facebook like or Instagram direct. Learn how to manage your Apple Watch notifications.
Your watch is waterproof. You can swim with newer 
  Apple Watch
 models, but it's a good idea to read up on what you can and can't do when it comes to getting your watch wet. 
Use theater mode. Ever see the button in Control Center with two masks on it and wonder what it is? That button activates theater mode. When enabled, your Apple Watch is silenced and your watch will not light up until you tap the screen. As its name implies, theater mode prevents your watch from lighting up while you're at a movie theater, but it's also helpful during meetings when you don't want any distractions. 
Fitness first. The Apple Watch can auto-detect certain workouts, track yoga workouts and store workout tunes from your favorite streaming service on the watch itself. Here are five of the best new fitness features in WatchOS 5.
Sleep tracking. With the release of WatchOS 7, Apple added a feature many Watch users have wanted for years: sleep tracking. You'll need to change your charging schedule to ensure you have enough battery life to get through a night of tracking your Z's, but your Watch will help you figure out when and how long you need to charge to make it. Read how to set up sleep tracking along with a couple of other features in WatchOS 7. 
Heart health. The Apple Watch continuously tracks your heart rate while you wear it throughout the day. There's a dedicated app to tracking your heart rate or conducting an on-demand reading. Read this to learn how to get the most out of the Apple Watch heart rate features. Also, check out why it's important to track your heart rate to reach your fitness goals.
Taking an ECG reading with the Apple Watch Series 4. 
Set up the ECG app. You'll need to have an Apple Watch Series 4 or later, running the latest version of WatchOS and an iPhone running iOS 12.1.1 or newer before you can set up the new ECG app. Once you're updated, using the ECG app is a simple task.
Hearing health. With the release of WatchOS 6 in late 2019, Apple added a new hearing health feature that monitors the noise level of your environment and will let you know if there's a risk of damage to your hearing. Here's what you need to know to use it.
Cycle tracking. Female health tracking hasn't received the attention it deserves, but that's changing with the addition of cycle tracking to the Apple Watch and the Apple Health app. Using the new tools, women can track their periods, keep tabs on symptoms and more. 
Fall detection. The Apple Watch Series 4 and newer has a built-in fall detection feature that will identify when it thinks you have fallen, and after a few seconds of no movement, will call emergency services on your behalf. Fall Detection is a feature you'll need to enable, but hopefully never have to use.
Want to feel like Inspector Gadget? Then learn how to use the Walkie-Talkie app. Using the app is simple: Hold up your wrist, press and hold a button, talk, and let go. Just keep in mind that your approved contacts can start talking to you at any moment, so marking yourself as unavailable is key to avoiding embarrassment.
Walkie-Talkie mode on the Apple Watch is fun but can be embarrassing. 
Unlock your Mac when wearing your Apple Watch. As long as you have a passcode set up on your Apple Watch, and a fairly recent Mac (2013 or newer), you can use your watch to log in to your Mac. On your Mac, go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy and check the box next to Allow your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac. Enter your Mac password when prompted. The next time you wake your Mac, your Apple Watch and Mac will talk to one another and sign you into your computer. It's pretty cool.
Check your AirPods battery status. You've surely opened your AirPods charging case next to your iPhone to check their current battery level. It turns out, you can check your AirPods battery life on the Apple Watch as well. Visit this link for tip No. 5, stay for all 19 AirPods tips.

"Apple gives iPad Pro a 5G option, though carrier plans will cost you",https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-finally-gives-ipad-pro-a-5g-option-though-carrier-plans-will-cost-you/,"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Faster cellular connectivity will be an option for Apple's latest iPad Pros.
  
The new iPad Pro will support 5G.

  Apple's
 new iPad Pros are joining the company's portfolio of 
  5G
 products. After the company made a big splash around 5G during its iPhone 12 event last year, on Tuesday Apple announced that the new cellular option will be available on its latest high-end iPads. 
All iPads since the original's introduction in 2010 have included an option for cellular connectivity, usually a $130-$150 premium compared to the standard Wi-Fi-only pricing. Apple will be charging $200 more for the 5G-capable iPad Pro, but as with other connected tablets, you will still need to pay extra for service from wireless carriers 
  AT&T
, 
  T-Mobile
 and 
  Verizon
. 
Pricing for wireless plans varies at each carrier, but for tablets, traditionally it has not been cheap. 
If you have an AT&T unlimited plan, you can add a tablet for $20 a month. Without unlimited, the carrier charges $50 a month for 15GB of tablet data on its Data Connect plan, or $75 a month for 35GB (both with a $10 discount for AutoPay and paperless billing). Going over your data will cost you $10 for every 2GB of data of additional data.  
Verizon has a few different options. The nation's largest carrier charges $20 per month if you already have an unlimited wireless plan with them for unlimited 
  4G LTE
 and low-band 5G access, but if you want access to its fastest 5G flavors you'll need to shell out $30 per month for its ""Unlimited Plus"" offering. 
If your account has a Do More or Get More unlimited plan, you can lower that by 50% a month. No phone service with Verizon? An unlimited tablet data plan runs $75 per month with the AutoPay and paperless billing discounts or $80 without. The Unlimited Plus option runs $85 with AutoPay and paperless billing or $90 without. 
Verizon's shared data plans allow you to add a tablet for $10 a month, but those plans cannot access its faster flavors of 5G and are limited just to its 4G LTE and low-band 5G networks. 
T-Mobile used to offer a free 200MB of data per month for tablets on its network, but discontinued the offer in 2017. That said, it still has the most affordable and widest range of tablet data plans with the cheapest running $5 per month for 500MB of high-speed data so long as you have one of its Magenta plans for phone service (Essentials, Magenta regular, Plus or Max). Spending $20 per month will get you unlimited tablet data over 4G LTE or 5G with AutoPay enabled. 
Most of those Magenta plans will allow for up to 50GB of data use before risking having your data slowed by the carrier for ""data prioritization."" If you have the carrier's recently announced Magenta Max plan for your phone, you won't need to worry about that 50GB threshold for your tablet. 
If you don't have T-Mobile wireless service, the pricing rises by $40 per month so the 500MB plan is $45 while the unlimited option is $60 per month (both with AutoPay).  "

    Apple debuted the AirTags tracking devices that will compete with Tile at its April event.
  
AirTags are finally here.
At its Spring Loaded virtual product launch event on Tuesday, Apple introduced AirTags (here's how you'll buy them), the tracker tags that will compete with Tile and Samsung's SmartTag Bluetooth trackers. Rumors about AirTags have been circulating for over a year while remaining elusive at Apple's events, until now.
AirTags are small beacon-style devices that can help you find lost items like your keys, backpack and more by tracking them with the Find My app. Apple uses a feature called Precision Finding to create a helpful overlay on your iPhone to help you find your lost item. Precision Finding uses input data from your camera, accelerometer and gyroscope and incorporates visual, haptic and audible feedback while you're searching.
You can personalize the new water and dust resistant tags with emojis and attach them to your items with a separate keychain. AirTags also have a built-in speaker, U1 chip, over a year of battery life and Siri support. 
AirTags start at $29 (£29, AU$45) each, but Apple has a four-pack for $99 (£99, AU$149). Orders open April 30.

    Track down products from Belkin, Chipolo and VanMoof using Apple's Find My app.
  
Apple is opening up the Find My network to third-party devices.
Apple is growing its Find My network to include devices made by third-party companies, including Belkin, Chipolo and VanMoof. Find My functionality launched in 2009 along with 
  iPhone 3GS
. Over the past 12 years it has grown from just tracking lost 
  iPhones
 to being able to find most Apple products like Macs, 
  Apple Watches
 and 
  AirPods
. With the launch of iOS 13 in 2019, Find My could get the approximate location of your lost Apple device using Bluetooth. For example when your iPhone is in Lost Mode, other Apple devices on the Find My network can discover it via Bluetooth and share that info securely and anonymously back to you. Currently, the Find My network has hundreds of millions of Apple devices tied to it.
Starting today, you can track non-Apple products like VanMoof's S3 and X3 e-bikes and starting in June Belkin's Soundform Freedom True Wireless Earbuds and the Chipolo One Spot item finder which can be attached to keys or a backpack, for example.
Third parties work with Apple as part of its MFi program to get products certified that they follow specifications for things like privacy, end-to-end encryption and unwanted tracking protection. Find My products can be added to the Items tab of the Find My app and attached to your Apple ID. If you ever sell or give a Find My item to someone else, it's just a simple swipe left to remove it from your Apple ID.
Certified Find My items have a built-in speaker to play a locate sound if you trigger it from within the app. You can set a Find My item to Lost Mode and be notified when it's found or add a note with an email address or phone number. Even if the item isn't online, it can be found using Bluetooth by other Apple and non-Apple devices enrolled in Find My. And the entire process is encrypted end-to-end to protect your privacy.
All Find My items or devices will have a ""Works with Apple Find My"" badge. If someone comes across your item and sees the badge they can go into their own Find My app into the Identify Found item section to report it as found. If the item has an attached note from Lost Mode the finder would be able to view it.
More products and accessories will enter the Find My network soon, Apple said in a press release Tuesday. 
Correction at 5:50 p.m. ET: Find My uses Bluetooth to find an approximate location of an item or Apple device that is in Lost Mode."
Apple Arcade: Fantasian is Final Fantasy creator's returns to nostalgic roots,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-arcade-fantasian-final-fantasy-creator-mobile-rpg/,"Fri, 02 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Fantasian, a new mobile RPG from Hironobu Sakaguchi featuring intricate handcrafted dioramas, is available now on Apple Arcade.
  
Fantasian is the latest RPG from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. 
Fantasian, the new mobile RPG from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi and Mistwalker -- and one of 
  Apple Arcade's
 most anticipated 
  games
 -- arrived Friday alongside Wonderbox from Aquiris and a slew of new games. Since it was teased at the gaming service's release in 2019, fans have eagerly awaited news on a potential release. Not ones to disappoint, Sakaguchi and Mistwalker have been consistently dropped updates on social media.
Through a translator, Sakaguchi spoke with CNET in early March about Fantasian, its connection to the Final Fantasy franchise, and what players can expect from the new game, which was three years in the making. 
Fantasian's story focuses on young protagonist Leo, who's searching across multiple dimensions to find his missing father. Leo has lost his memory after an explosion at a hybrid magic-tech factory. After waking up in a world dominated by machines, he has only one clue: a repeating vision of a young woman. When Leo arrives in En, a dusty frontier town, he meets Kina -- the woman from his dream. 
The pair set off on a quest to reclaim Leo's memories and discover their destinies. As Leo's past is revealed along with other mysteries in the multidimensional adventure, the balance between order and chaos becomes harder to maintain. 
Fantasian looks absolutely gorgeous. 
When players lead Leo and his newfound companions through Fantasian's multiple realms, they'll be exploring over 150 handcrafted dioramas built by artisans in the Japanese special effects industry, who had a hand in projects like the Godzilla films, Attack on Titan and Ultraman. The worlds give players plenty of chances to explore, admire subtle details and search for Easter eggs. 
In addition to the focus on handcrafted dioramas, Sakaguchi's team paid close attention to how the game would be played. Sakaguchi said the first half of Fantasian is more narrative driven and that the second half takes on a more traditional quest experience. As players progress through the game, they'll notice that even the supporting characters have their own heritage, personal quests and even emotional baggage.   
Fantasian also polishes the classic Japanese RPG genre with its gameplay mechanics. Mistwalker used a ""novel"" approach to tell the story: As players collect various memories, journal entries, and notes, the story unfolds as ""miniature in-game novels,"" with unique artwork, music and sound effects, for a more immersive experience. Players can also use a feature called the Dimengeon Battle mechanic to send previously encountered enemies to another dimension to fight later.

A few years ago, Sakaguchi was playing Final Fantasy VI with some old colleagues when the idea for Fantasian was born. Sakaguchi said it was like returning to his roots. 
""It really reminded me how much I love this classic RPG game genre,"" Sakaguchi said. ""And even from the Final Fantasy days, we've carried on this spirit of innovation and pushing the boundaries in terms of the status quo.""
A look at battles in Fantasian. 
The technological advancements since Final Fantasy VI alongside the art form of the dioramas made for a new and different experience in making Fantasian, Sakaguchi said.
Japanese composer Nobuo Uematsu, who scored the Final Fantasy series and has worked with Sakaguchi for over 35 years, composed 60 tracks specifically for Fantasian. Uematsu has also worked on other Mistwalker games, like Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon. 
""I've had some of my colleagues test-play this and asked for their impressions,"" Sakaguchi said. ""They've told me that playing Fantasian somehow felt nostalgic. I guess that nostalgia is in a way what links Fantasian to its Final Fantasy heritage."" 
Fantasian places 3D characters into real, physical environments full of striking details. Each diorama was specially lit, photographed and 3D scanned before the 3D models were superimposed on top. This adds a new element when it comes to gameplay. 
""I think the dioramas have an interesting synergy with the Apple Arcade platform,"" Sakaguchi said. ""Most of the devices I imagine [that people play on] are 
  iPads
 or 
  iPhones
. Because those are mediums were you tap the screen with your hand, there's a touch-based interface. The dioramas, which are also handcrafted, have that human touch. Through the glass -- the medium -- you're touching these elements that the artisans created by hand."" 
The dioramas that make up Fantasian's environment were built by hand.
Sakaguchi said the handcrafted environments lend the game's visual expression a unique charm and warmth. With more traditional, computer-generated games, it's more about copying and pasting, he added. 
""You could copy and paste a bunch of trees and make a forest,"" Sakaguchi said. ""Dioramas are an interesting meld of two different worlds where you're re-creating these natural elements that exist in our real world, but by human hand. It gives it a very unique kind of 'unbalance,' which to me lends itself to being an interesting environment design for this game.""
In the time of the pandemic, 
  video games
 have provided many people with a way to cope and escape. With Fantasian, Sakaguchi hopes to add something extra: connection and warmth. When something is created by hand, he said, it has a certain touch and feel that creates a connection between the person who made it and the person who uses it. 
Another battle sequence in Fantasian. 
""Take music for example,"" he said. ""With advancements and technology, there are so many amazing synthesizers and sampling libraries that you can use to create entire orchestras. That doesn't compare to when someone plays the string of a violin. I think the same could be said of video games."" 
During these uncertain times, when physical human touch is lost for many, Sakaguchi said he hopes Fantasian can help players see the world a bit differently.
""I think there's a sense of excitement that we can all share and get from that,"" Sakaguchi said of Fantasian and the characters' journeys. ""What I hope the audience feels as they step into the world of Fantasian is that, 'I'm so glad I spent time in this world.' That's the emotion I would love to draw out as they transport themselves to another world."" 

  Apple
 entered the mobile gaming world more than a year ago with the release of Apple Arcade. The subscription gaming service costs $5 a month and lets you play more than 145 new and exclusive games across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, iPod Touch and Apple TV. 
If you want to give Apple Arcade a try, you can get a one-month free trial, or a three-month free trial if you purchase a new iPhone 12 device. The Apple One subscription bundle also launched last year, which makes it more affordable to get up to six Apple subscription services, Apple Arcade included, for one price."
AirPods Pro vs. AirPods Max: Should you buy earbuds or headphones?,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/airpods-pro-vs-airpods-max-should-you-buy-earbuds-headphones/,"Sun, 04 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks.

    Here's how to choose between Apple's high-end AirPods.
  

  Apple
 has three AirPods to choose from and if you're deciding between the higher-end options, the $249 (£249, AU$399) AirPods Pro and $549 (£549, AU$899) AirPods Max, there's more to consider just price alone. For starters, one is a pair of in-ear wireless earbuds while the other is an over-ear, also wireless, closed-back headphone. 
But despite their obvious physical differences, they have more in common than you might think. Both have active noise cancelation, a transparency mode to let in sound from the outside world, plus spatial audio. I've been using both sets of AirPods for several months to help you decide which is the better buy for you.
Apple's AirPods Pro are the jack-of-all-trades of wireless earbuds: They're good for listening to music or podcasts and making calls and they're comfortable to wear throughout the day. You can also use one earbud independently, while the other one charges in the case. They're the only AirPods that have an IP rating so they'll withstand splashes or sweat.
Read the AirPods Pro review.
  
These are the best-sounding AirPods, hands down. You get everything found on the AirPods Pro, including noise cancelation and spatial audio, plus a long-lasting battery. They also look good thanks to a stainless steel and aluminum finish. But they might be too heavy for some wearers.
Read the AirPods Max review.
  
The AirPods Pro are much smaller and lighter than the AirPods Max seeing as they're in-ear wireless earbuds. The AirPods Pro comes with interchangeable tips so you can customize how the buds fit in your ear. I find them comfortable to wear throughout the day, although I've swapped out the default silicone tips for third-party foam tips as these tend to stay in my ears better when I'm moving around or working out.
The AirPods Max have telescopic arms that expand and contract to accommodate your head shape, as well as cups that pivot to provide a comfortable fit around your ears. There's foam padding around each of the cups that provides some sound insulation, plus a mesh headband to help distribute the weight across your head. But the AirPods Max are much heavier than many other noise canceling headphones I've used at 13.6 ounces (384 grams), thanks in part to their aluminum and stainless steel construction. I found I could only wear them for an hour or two at a time before I needed to give my head a break.
You'll also be able to wear the AirPods Pro in all sorts of weather conditions or while working out as they're IPX4 rated, which means they'll be able to withstand sweat or light splashes from rain. The AirPods Max don't have an IP rating, so I would avoid using them in any situation where you might get them wet.
Each of the AirPods models comes with a case, either a hard plastic case for the AirPods Pro that holds additional charge, or a soft case for the AirPods Max. Unfortunately the AirPods Max case doesn't hold any additional charge, nor does it provide much added protection for the headphones. Both recharge via Lightning, or you can wirelessly charge the AirPods Pro case.
It's no surprise the AirPods Max sound better than the AirPods Pro. I've listened to a variety of different genres of music across different apps and keep coming back to the AirPods Max for listening to music. They have a stronger bass response and excellent definition across all frequencies. The best way I've found to describe the sound is that it's clean. Even at higher volumes I've never noticed any muddiness or distortion.
The AirPods Pro also sounds good, but it's less dynamic and exciting to listen to than the AirPods Max. This actually works to its advantage if you're jumping between different tasks such as listening to music, taking calls or tuning into a podcast. Both AirPods have an adaptive equalizer that changes the sound dynamically, although you can change the equalizer independently in different music apps, from Spotify to 
  Apple Music
.
Noise canceling is also obviously superior on the AirPods Max. I set up a loud, overhead fan and tested both the Max and Pro, with the headphones almost completely drowning out the white noise. That said, the AirPods Pro has excellent noise-canceling features and is the only pair I've used on a plane (before the pandemic), but it's not at the same level as the AirPods Max. 
Apple's transparency mode is excellent on both and provides a natural listening experience when you want to let in some external sound to be aware of your surroundings.
You can hear microphone samples from both AirPods models in the video on this page.
Apart from noise cancelation and transparency mode, both of the AirPods also have spatial audio. This means supported TV shows and movies in certain apps can deliver a virtual surround sound experience when listening on either pair of AirPods.
The AirPods Pro have clickable stem controls to change tracks, activate noise cancelation or to answer calls, while the AirPods Max have a digital crown and side button. If you have an 
  Apple Watch
, these controls will be familiar: Use the crown to change volume, switch tracks or take calls, while the button switches between noise canceling and transparency modes. Both sets of AirPods support Hey 
  Siri
, so they can listen for your voice prompts and can also read text messages aloud in your ears.
Both also share the same H1 chip for fast connectivity to the 
  iPhone
 and you can also quickly switch between devices if you're signed into the same Apple ID. As they're Bluetooth headphones, you can use both the AirPods Pro or AirPods Max on Android, or a Windows PC, but you miss out on iOS-specific things like spatial audio or being able to customize the controls.
AirPods Pro have around 4.5 hours of listening time with noise canceling active, even though you can sometimes edge closer to 5 hours. The case holds additional charge, so all up you get 24 hours of listening time. As mentioned earlier, the AirPods Max case doesn't hold any additional charge, but the headphones themselves last for just over 20 hours straight at normal volume.
After almost three months of using both the headphones in my daily workflow, I gravitate towards the AirPods Pro more thanks to their flexibility and comfort. If I'm jumping between calls and listening to music at work, to taking a walk after hours, they're the most flexible set of AirPods for my use. But when I want to listen to music with the best sound quality, I switch to the AirPods Max. I also expect to use the AirPods Max more once travel restrictions ease, as they have the most effective noise canceling."
Facebook says iPhone users will start seeing new privacy prompt today,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/facebook-says-iphone-users-will-start-seeing-new-privacy-prompt-today/,"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Facebook users will be asked to give the social network permission to track their activity across other apps and websites.
  
Facebook isn't a fan of Apple's privacy update.

  Facebook
 users who own 
  iPhones
 will soon face a decision about their online 
  privacy
.
On Monday, Facebook said it will start rolling out a new prompt that asks users who have updated their 
  Apple
 device's 
  operating systems
 to give the social network permission to track their activities across other 
  apps
 and websites. The social network, along with other apps, are being required to make this change as part of 
  iOS
 14.5, which Apple released Monday.
""We'll start rolling out the prompt to iOS 14.5 users today, but we will roll out the prompt over the course of a few weeks, so not all eligible users will see the prompt right away,"" a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. The representative added some Facebook users have already seen the prompt, but declined to say how many. 
Facebook plans to show its users this screen before asking them permission to track them across other apps and websites.
""We're ramping this rollout globally to ensure everything works as expected,"" the spokesperson said. Facebook has 2.8 billion monthly active users worldwide.
Facebook has publicly sparred with Apple about the change, accusing the smartphone maker of making a move it says will harm small businesses that rely on the company's targeted ads to reach new customers. Apple has said it's rolling out the feature, known as App Tracking Transparency, to give users more control over their data. Facebook plans to show users its own screen before showing Apple's prompt, noting the social network uses data from other apps and websites to display personalized ads, keep the service free and support businesses. 
Facebook has battled several privacy scandals in recent years, raising concerns that the social media company isn't doing enough to protect user data. In 2018, revelations surfaced that political consulting firm Cambridge Analytic harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook users without their permission. The social network, which makes most of its money from advertising, is scheduled to release its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday."
New iMac comes with magnetic power plug that doubles as Ethernet cable,https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/new-imac-comes-with-magnetic-power-plug-that-doubles-as-ethernet-cable/,"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    The new M1 iMac's power cable is similar to the MagSafe cables on the MacBook.
  
The new iMac power plug isn't just for power.

  Apple
 showed off its refreshed iMac lineup during its spring event Tuesday.  Along with a thinner form, 24-inch display and a rainbow of colors, the new device has also changed the way it handles power. 
The new M1 iMac's power cable is magnetic, similar to the MagSafe cables on the MacBook. Another change is that the power brick will have an Ethernet plug-in, which means the plug can handle both internet and power at the same time, rather than needing a separate adapter for it. 
The power adapter wasn't the only big change to the iMac. Apple's refreshed computers will come with the company's new M1 chip -- the same processor used for its latest MacBooks and Mac Minis -- for better performance and lower energy usage. There's also an improved speaker system, Touch ID on wireless keyboards and a 1,080p webcam. Apple's Spring Loaded event also revealed a new, more powerful iPad Pro and a new purple color for iPhones. 
Apple's new lineup of iMacs starts at $1,299 (£1,249, AU$1,899) with four colors to pick from. A step up to $1,499 (£1,449, AU$2,199) gets you a choice of seven colors, along with more features. Preorders start April 30."
Apple's M1 Mac shines as iPhones fly off (virtual) store shelves,https://www.cnet.com/tech/apples-m1-mac-shines-as-iphones-fly-off-virtual-store-shelves/,"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Apple says a combination of enthusiasm over 5G wireless and working from home is driving demand despite a global chip shortage.
  
Apple's iPhone 12 and new M1 Macs are making a difference.
For more than a decade, 
  Apple
 faithful have worried the mega-success of the 
  iPhone
 would draw the company's attention away from its 
  Mac
 computers. After all, its biggest events always revolve around the iPhone. And even Oprah focused on the iPhone when announcing her new partnership with the company, quipping, ""They're in a billion pockets, y'all. A billion pockets.""
Now those Mac computers are having a bit of a moment. The company's trademark 
  laptops
 and 
  desktops
 notched their best sales quarter ever during its second fiscal quarter, which is the three months ended in March. That amounted to $9.1 billion in sales, higher than the 
  iPad
, Apple Watch or 
  AirPods
.
""Demand feels very strong right now,"" said Apple CEO Tim Cook while discussing the company's results. He attributed the spike in part to the new technology built into the Mac (of course). He also said that working and learning from home played a part, and noted that with many people likely returning to a hybrid work setup when the pandemic ends, this trend may continue. ""iPad and Mac continue to be critically important tools for our customers,"" he said.
The results were the highlight of a strong earnings report from the company, in which its profits more than doubled from the same time last year, and revenue jumped 53%. Sales of iPhones jumped too, up 65%, and the Mac and the iPad both saw sales increase by more than 70%.

Apple's results mark the latest example of how technology companies have thrived during the coronavirus pandemic. The iPhone 12, with its new design and 5G wireless technology, appears to have drawn people's attention since its launch in October. People have also turned to Mac computers and iPad 
  tablets
 to help with learning and working from home, a trend driving unusually high demand across the tech industry. Apple said its Mac computers reported their best quarterly revenue ever Wednesday.
Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, called the financial report ""a 'drop the mic' quarter for Apple."" He has an ""outperform"" rating on the stock.
The M1 chip is Apple's big bet on the future of the Mac, using technology derived from the iPhone.
What's made Apple an unusual case during this last year has been its relatively strong supply of products despite an international chip shortage that's made it frustratingly hard for people to buy laptops, graphics cards, video game consoles and even cars. But before the iPhone 12 launch last year, Apple had a steady supply of iPhones available to customers. Apple said that despite the enthusiasm over 5G, which helped propel its highest-ever revenue and profit during the holidays, it was able to produce enough 
  phones
 to meet demand in the past few months. 
Apple did say it's struggling to meet demand for the iPad and the Mac, though. Some of that may be due to Apple's newest chip, the M1, which was designed by in-house engineers to replace the Intel microprocessors the company had relied on before. The company's first M1-powered Macs garnered positive reviews and quickly became the most popular computers across its product line. Now, the $799 
  iPad Pro
 and $1,299 
  iMac
 will also be powered by the M1 when they go on preorder Friday.
Apple said it didn't know how long the chip shortage would keep supply from meeting demand, but it expects to be ""supply-gated, not demand-gated"" for the foreseeable future. That's in line with what other companies are saying too.
Apple's newest iPhone 12 color, purple, goes on sale Friday.
The strong Mac sales mirrored the success of the iPhone, which notched $47.9 billion in sales during the second fiscal quarter, up 65% from the year prior. While the company is still highly dependent on the iPhone, which makes up more than half of its revenue, other businesses have stepped up. 
Apple's iPads rang up $7.8 billion in sales, and the Mac hit $9.1 billion in sales, both up more than 70% when compared to last year.
All told, Apple said it raked in profits of $23.6 billion, more than double what it was the same time last year. That translates to $1.40 per share in profit. It posted revenue of $89.6 billion, up 53% from the $58.3 billion it reported last year. It also blew way past analyst estimates, which were 99 cents in profit per share on $77.4 billion in sales according to surveys published by Yahoo Finance.
The company's stock rose a little more than 2% in after-hours trading after closing down nearly 1% to $133.58 per share during market hours. The company's shares have risen about 3% so far this year."

    Apple announced the new purple iPhone 12 on Tuesday along with new iMacs, an updated AppleTV, AirTags and an iPad Pro.
  
The iPhone 12 is now available in purple.
The iPhone 12 now comes in purple. Tim Cook made the announcement himself at Tuesday's Apple's spring event. Until now, the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini were available in black, white, blue, green and red (part of Product Red). The iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max come in graphite, gold, silver and blue finishes. A video showing off the purple iPhone included The Candy Man, the song from the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. Cook said the new purple color is meant to evoke spring. The announcement came along with new iMacs, an updated Apple TV, AirTags and an iPad Pro.

The purple iPhone 12 goes on presale April 23 and will be available on April 30. Prices start at $829 (£799, AU$1,350) for the iPhone 12 or $799 if you activate it on a carrier when you buy it. The purple iPhone 12 Mini starts at $729 (£699, AU$1,199) or $699 with a carrier discount. 
For all intents and purposes, the purple iPhone is the same as the existing iPhone 12 and 12 Mini. It has the same flat-sided design, support for 5G and OLED screen with support for HDR. The screen is covered with Apple's ceramic shield. The body has an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance and supports MagSafe wireless charging and accessories. It has the same A14 Bionic processor, runs the same iOS 14 software and even has the same cameras.

iOS 14.5 has arrived: Download and install it on your iPhone and iPad right now,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/ios-14-5-has-arrived-download-and-install-it-on-your-iphone-and-ipad-right-now/,"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Apple's latest update for your iPhone or iPad is here, in the form of iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5. Here's what you need to know.
  
The latest software update for your iPhone or iPad is here. 
Apple's latest update for the iPhone and iPad is out now, and it brings a ton of new features. iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 include several new features and improvements. For example, you can now unlock your iPhone using Face ID when wearing a facial covering, and you'll now have the option to stop apps from tracking you across the web and other apps. There are also new Siri voices to choose from.
The release of iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 comes after Apple's first event of 2021, where the company announced new iPad Pro models, the Tile-like AirTag, a new Apple TV with a new remote, a purple iPhone and colorful iMacs.
If you're ready to jump right into Apple's latest operating system for your phone or tablet, I'll walk you through the steps below. However, it might be a good idea to wait a few days before installing new software in case there are any issues. Keep in mind, if you take the plunge now, going back to iOS 14.4 isn't really possible.   
It's easy to get really excited and install a new software update and all of its fancy features the moment it's available, but don't get too overzealous. I suggest taking a few minutes to do some routine maintenance on your iPhone or iPad before tapping on that install button.    
Not only will it help ensure a smooth update, but you'll free up storage and clutter in the process, and you'll have a fresh backup at the ready should anything go wrong when you install the update.    
We have a guide that walks you through cleaning up your device's storage and the best method for creating a backup.    
Does your phone run iOS 13? Then it will run iOS 14. 
Apple is keeping its portfolio of supported iPhone and iPad models the same as for iOS 13.         
The good news is if you've ever installed a software update on your phone or tablet, you'll feel right at home installing iOS 14.5. It installs just like any other software update, there aren't any extra steps you need to take. That said, It's a good idea to have your device plugged into a charger to ensure you don't drain the battery, and a strong Wi-Fi connection will help speed up the process without burning through your data plan. On your iPhone or iPad, follow these steps:   
1. Open the Settings app.   
2. Select General.

iPhone 13 vs. purple iPhone 12: What to consider before you upgrade,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-13-vs-purple-iphone-12-what-to-consider-before-you-upgrade/,"Fri, 28 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    We're past the probable halfway point between the iPhone 12 and 13, and Apple goes and releases a pretty new purple color.
  
The iPhone 12 got a fresh new purple hue this spring, just a few months before the rumored iPhone 13 release date.

  Apple
 released a new color for the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini this spring, and it's purple. It's on sale now, but I got my hands on one of the new phones ahead of time. And I can indeed confirm, it's purple. But the timing of the new color is six months after Apple launched the iPhone 12 series and less than six months away from the rumored iPhone 13. So should you buy one or wait? I promise to explain.
Purple is the sixth color for the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini, which come in black, white, blue, green, Product Red and now purple. There were six colors in Apple's rainbow logo, which the company used from the late '70s through the '90s, and which also had purple in it. The new purple color isn't available on the iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max, which makes sense because the Pro models usually stick to graphite, silver and gold finishes.

The purple iPhone 12 and 12 Mini went on sale in April. Prices start at $829 (£799, AU$1,350) for the iPhone 12 or $799 if you activate it on a carrier when you buy it. The purple iPhone 12 Mini starts at $729 (£699, AU$1,199) or $699 with a carrier discount.
Unboxing the iPhone 12 in purple is, no surprise, exactly the same as unboxing any other iPhone 12 or 12 Mini. It has the same thinner box design that Apple rolled out in October as a way to reduce its impact on the environment. The box has the purple phone on it with the word iPhone and the Apple logo in purple. 
It comes with the same accessories as other iPhone 12 models: a single Lightning-to-USB-C cable. Apple doesn't include wired headphones or a wall charger in the box any more.
My first reaction to seeing the phone in-person? Yeah, that's purple. In the promotion video at the event, the purple color looked like a deep rich shade, like Prince purple. Or Joker from Batman purple. But this is actually a pretty light purple. Almost like an Easter purple.
Last year, there was the iPhone 11 in purple, but that was more of a light lavender color. The purple on the iPhone 12 looks richer, but gives off the same positive vibes.
The flat aluminum edges on the iPhone 12 are also purple and match the back. It definitely looks striking in-person. But even though the color is new, everything else about the phone is the same. It has the same support for 
  5G
. The OLED screen is covered with Apple's ceramic shield. The body has an IP68 rating for dust- and water-resistance. It supports MagSafe wireless charging and accessories. It has the same A14 Bionic processor, runs on iOS 14 software and even has the same cameras.
And that brings me to the question: Should you buy it? We're at that weird halfway point in the typical iPhone refresh cycle. And it's smart for Apple to release a new color to help spur interest in the iPhone 12.
In most cases, if you're due for an upgrade and are looking to get an iPhone, it would be silly to wait. Get the iPhone 12 and rest comfortably knowing that Apple supports its 
  phones
 four or even five years after they're released with OS and security updates.
If you know you'll want the latest and the newest and you can wait six months, you probably already know your decision. And if you love all things purple, what are you waiting for? But let's be real for a moment. No matter which phone you get or which color it is, most people will likely take this purple beauty and put it in a case."
Connect PS5 and Xbox controllers to your iPhone and other Apple devices,https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/connect-ps5-and-xbox-controllers-to-your-iphone-and-other-apple-devices/,"Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks.

    A new wave of OS updates brings more connectivity for gamers wanting to use wireless controllers with their iPhones, iPads, Apple TVs and Macs.
  
We'll show you how to use your Xbox and PS5 controllers to play Apple App Store and Apple Arcade games on your iPhone and more.
In April, Apple released a slew of OS updates that added support for Sony's PS5 DualSense and Microsoft's Xbox Wireless controllers. That means now I can connect PS5 and Xbox controllers to my Apple TV, iPhone 12, iMac and MacBook Pro. It will also work with the newest iPad Pro that I'm expecting to receive later this month. And the great news: Setting up wireless console controllers to play games on the range of Apple screens is incredibly easy to do.
A few months ago I discovered that many Apple Arcade games aren't very fun to play with the Apple TV remote, so naturally I tried to figure out how to use my PS5 controller instead. The first thing I learned was that the PS5 DualSense controller wasn't compatible with the version of TVOS I had installed. I had to dig out my DualShock 4 controller, which worked just fine.
But now, with TVOS 14.5, I can now use both my DualSense controller and Xbox Wireless controller for much smoother, more natural gameplay than using the Apple TV remote. 
Before proceeding further, I recommend updating the operating system on any of the devices you plan to connect with Xbox and PS5 controllers. Just look in your device's settings for a Software Update option.
It's also worth noting that not all games are compatible with external controllers. Many games in the App Store, Apple Arcade or other sources are designed to be used with traditional keyboard and mouse controls -- or the touch screen on a mobile device. But there are also titles that let you choose different controller options.
Press and hold the PlayStation Button and the Share button to enter Discovery Mode.
When it comes to connecting a controller to your Apple device, Bluetooth is going to be your best friend. That means the first thing we need to learn how to put our controllers into Discovery Mode.
For the DualSense controller, with the power turned off, hold down the PlayStation and Share buttons for a few seconds until the lights around the touchpad flash.
For the Xbox Wireless controller, hold down the Xbox button to power it on, indicated by a slow flashing light. Then press the Pair button on the controller's front until the Xbox logo blinks.
The pairing button is located near the USB-C port on the Xbox Wireless controller
iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5 now support DualSense and Xbox controllers.
To connect your controller to your iPhone or iPad, go to the Bluetooth settings.
When you put your controller in pairing mode it will show up under Other Devices. Select the controller and it will move up to My Devices when it's successfully connected.
You'll no doubt find that some games are better played on the phone or the tablet itself. However, if you want that controller experience, an iPad or keyboard cover would probably come in handy. There are also a number of companies that offer a phone mount for both controllers, like the Orzly PS5 Controller Mobile Gaming Clip.
When it comes to connecting to a desktop or laptop computer, you actually have a couple of choices when connecting these controllers.
Both the DualSense and the Xbox controller have a USB-C port, so it's easy to plug it in with a cable. The Mac should recognize the controller when it's plugged in, but it might be hard to notice until you open a game that uses controllers.
The other choice for connecting controllers to your Mac is to use Bluetooth.
The MacBook Pro showed me key prompts for the Xbox controller while using the DualSense
Open the Bluetooth control panel in System Preferences, put the controller into pairing mode, and select your controller.
When I use the Xbox controller, it first shows displaying its MAC address. It looks like a weird string of characters, like ""44-16-22-de-9b-87"". But when I hit the Connect button, the name changes to Xbox Wireless Controller.
When I connect my DualSense controller, my Mac doesn't identify it as a Sony device, but it does connect without a problem. I did notice that sometimes a game will give me prompts that go with the Xbox controller, like the A and B buttons, but the DualSense still works just fine.
Using a controller to play games on the Apple TV lets you sit back and enjoy the big screen experience from a comfortable distance.
To pair a controller with the Apple TV go to Settings > Remotes and Devices > Other Devices > Bluetooth
Once you're there, put the controller into Discovery Mode. It should show up on the list of available devices. Select it, and when it's ready, it will show up as connected. Play on!"
Former NASA and Apple engineer builds another Ninja Warrior course for squirrels,https://www.cnet.com/culture/internet/former-nasa-and-apple-engineer-built-a-ninja-warrior-course-for-squirrels-again/,"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Mark Rober is back, facing off against his greatest frenemy.
  
The maze features Mission Impossible inspiration.
Last spring, you may recall that former NASA and Apple engineer Mark Rober built what amounted to a Ninja Warrior course for squirrels. Rober's problem was simple: He had built a bird feeder and the damn squirrels kept eating all the food. 
Back then Rober went to hilarious lengths to create an obstacle course that no squirrel could possibly navigate -- yet the squirrels still managed to break the course and figure things out. 
A year later, Rober decided to take on the squirrels again.
Enter: Backyard Squirrel Maze 2.0.
The contraption Rober designed and built alongside his friends took two months of meticulous planning, but the real fun comes in watching the squirrels completely dissect and destroy their best laid plans.
Eventually, as you might expect, the squirrels win, but the entire video is a joy to watch. "

iPhone 8 vs. iPhone 12: What you'll get if you upgrade,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-8-vs-iphone-12-what-youll-get-if-you-upgrade/,"Mon, 24 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Here's how to decide whether you should upgrade to the brand-new iPhone 12 or hang on to your iPhone 8.
  
Out of the four iPhone 12 models that 
  Apple
 announced last October, the iPhone 12 is best suited for most people, and it's also one of our highest-rated phones ever. But if you've held back from upgrading since 2017's iPhone 8, you're probably wondering whether now is the time to do so. After all, the iPhone 12 boasts a string of significant new features including 5G, a ceramic-hardened display and MagSafe charging. While these updates and others are welcome additions to the iPhone 12, not all of them will materially affect your daily life, at least for now. 
Here's everything you need to know about how the iPhone 12 compares with the iPhone 8 before you make that decision to upgrade -- or wait another until the next-gen iPhone.
Read more: Here are CNET's reviews of the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max. 
The camera systems on the iPhone 8 and iPhone 12 are one of the biggest differences between the two devices, and it's something that will noticeably affect your experience and buying decision. During the nearly four years since Apple launched the iPhone 8, the company has made impressive strides in improving camera technology 
With the iPhone 12, you'll see big gains in image quality and more flexibility around the kinds of photographs you can capture. For instance, the iPhone 8 only has one camera. It doesn't have Portrait Mode nor does it feature a second, ultrawide camera, which is for capturing sweeping landscapes. Both those things are found in all four iPhone 12 models. 
Combined with Apple's powerful computational photography software, like Apple's impressive low-light feature called Night Mode, the iPhone 12 takes some of the 
  best smartphone
 photos no matter what time of day. And if you want even more camera upgrades, the 
  iPhone 12 Pro
 and 
  iPhone 12 Pro Max
 has a third telephoto lens, as well as lidar. (If you want to learn more about lidar, read this.)
The iPhone 12 models are the first iPhones to offer next-generation 5G cellular connectivity. Carriers have claimed that 5G speeds are almost twice as fast as 4G, and Apple spent a considerable amount of time during its launch event hyping up the new tech. But 5G coverage is patchy across the US, and your experience will vary depending on where you live. Some areas have absolutely zero coverage, while other parts (mainly big cities) have 5G networks from all major US carriers. The bottom line is: There is no universal 5G experience, so it's important to research the 5G coverage in your area. If you do upgrade, at the very least you can take comfort in knowing your device is future-proof as 5G continues to expand this year and the next.
The displays of the iPhone 12 and iPhone 8 are very different -- they vary in size, type, resolution and even material. The iPhone 12 line has one of the best displays you can get on a phone today. All four 
  phones
 use a premium OLED panel, while the iPhone 8 has an LCD display. OLED panels usually have better contrast and deeper black levels than their LCD counterparts. 
The iPhone 8 has a 4.7-inch screen, while the iPhone 12 has a 6.1-inch display. Because there are several iPhone 12 models, you can also choose the smaller 5.4-inch 
  iPhone 12 Mini
 and the larger 6.7-inch iPhone 12 Pro Max. 
Apple debuts its MagSafe-branded charging system alongside the iPhone 12.
New to the iPhone line is the iPhone 12's ceramic-hardened glass known as Ceramic Shield, which Apple says offers four times more drop protection. During our Phone 12 drop test (and subsequent iPhone 12 Mini drop test), CNET's former editor Vanessa Hand Orellana concluded that the Ceramic Shield seems indestructible. The iPhone 12's screen survived without a crack after it was dropped six times on a sidewalk, including three back-to-back drops from a height of nine feet. 
The iPhone 8 uses a type of glass made specifically for Apple by 
  Corning
, but it's not Gorilla Glass. When we conducted drop tests, we discovered that at 3 feet (0.9 meters), it survived. At 5 feet (1.5 meters), however, the iPhone 8 shattered. 
Apple confirmed the fears of some iPhone fans when it announced that the iPhone 12 box wouldn't come with either a wall adapter or wired earphones. The company is betting most people already own these accessories, but if you do need them you'll have to buy them separately. 
Apple's reasoning to leave behind the wall adapter may also have something to do with its introduction of MagSafe. It's a proprietary wireless charging system on the iPhone 12 that uses magnets. In addition to charging pads though, other nifty accessories can snap onto the back of the device too, and are sold separately. As for the iPhone 8, it comes with a Lightning cable and plug, and it also works with the existing Qi wireless charging standard.

With every next-gen iPhone, also comes next-gen processors. All four iPhone 12 phones use the same A14 Bionic processor seen in the iPad Air. The benchmark tests conducted by CNET's Patrick Holland concluded that the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro were the most powerful phones we've ever tested. It'll definitely be snappier than the A11 chip on the iPhone 8, but the average person will likely be hard-pressed to notice the difference. 
Apple doesn't release battery capacity numbers. But for battery life, our preliminary tests show that the iPhone 12 lasted 17 hours, 14 minutes with looped video playing at half brightness in airplane mode. The iPhone 8 meanwhile lasted 13 and a half hours.
The iPhone 12 has a revamped design that, while reminiscent of the 
  iPhone 5
, still feels modern and premium. It also marks one of the biggest design changes since the 
  iPhone X
. The iPhone 8, on the other hand, has an old-school iPhone design with a home button and thick bezels. As such, you do not get that expansive, largely unobstructed screen that is the hallmark of a modern smartphone. Check out our iPhone 12 and iPhone 8 photo galleries to see for yourself.
Also, the iPhone 12 has several features that the iPhone 8 doesn't. The iPhone 12 has a third storage option (128GB), and Wi-Fi 6 and UWB are notable for ""future-proofing"" your phone. (Here's our Wi-Fi 6 explainer in case you want more info, and some speculation on what UWB will be used for.) And although this might not be a top priority at the moment, the dual-SIM feature on the iPhone 12 is useful for when you're traveling or if you have a working SIM from another country that you want to store and use for your next trip. The iPhone 8 takes only one SIM.
For a spec-by-spec comparison between the iPhone 12 and iPhone 8, take a look at our chart below."
Apple cites 'significant' malware on Mac while defending iOS App Store in Fortnite trial,https://www.cnet.com/news/privacy/apple-cites-significant-malware-on-mac-while-defending-ios-app-store-in-fortnite-trial/,"Wed, 19 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Apple's head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, says malware on Macs has hit ""unacceptable"" levels.
  
Apple's computers, once known for their security, have been struggling.
More than a decade ago, Apple ran an ad in which a guy known as ""PC"" sneezed repeatedly as he explained computer viruses to a confused fellow called ""Mac."" ""You better stay back; this one's a doozy,"" said comedian John Hodgman, who plays PC in the ad. ""Do not be a hero. Last year there were 114,000 known viruses for PCs.""
""PCs, not Macs,"" Justin Long, playing the Apple computer, says just before PC collapses.
Now times have changed. 
As Apple has notched the most successful sales of Mac computers in history, its head of 
  software
 engineering, Craig Federighi, says attacks have risen as well. ""Today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don't find acceptable,"" he said Wednesday during testimony defending Apple in a lawsuit with Fortnite maker Epic Games in a California court.
Each week, Apple identifies a couple pieces of malware on its own or with help of third parties, Federighi added, and it uses built-in systems to automatically remove them from customers' computers. But still, the malware can infect hundreds of thousands of computers before Apple stamps it out. Since last May, Federighi said, there have been 130 types of Mac malware, and one of them alone infected 300,000 systems. 
Federighi said he believes Macs are still more secure than PCs, but he made clear that the Mac's facing a ""significantly larger malware problem"" than are 
  iPhones
, 
  iPads
 and Apple's other devices. ""It's an endless game of whack-a-mole.""
Apple's choice to essentially attack the security of its own software may seem shocking after the company spent years criticizing competing PCs as insecure. But Apple's now defending its App Store for the iPhone and iPad in a California court, where Epic is asking a judge to force major change. The court is considering whether Apple should be allowed to wall off its phones and tablets, only allowing apps to be installed through its App Store. Epic says that Apple's approach is too restrictive and that competing technologies should be allowed onto its phones as well.
Federighi described Apple's restrictive approach as an important part of protecting the more than 1 billion iPhones in active use. ""It's an attractive target,"" he added, noting the cameras, microphones, location data and two-step authentication technology that are standard on smartphones these days. ""All of these things make access or control of these devices potentially incredibly valuable to an attacker.""
Apple isn't alone recognizing the rising plight of attacks on its computers. Cybersecurity company Malwarebytes wrote last year that the amount of malware being detected on Macs was outpacing that on PCs for the first time. And it cited overconfident Apple users as one of the reasons.
""People need to understand that they're not safe just because they're  using a Mac,"" Thomas Reed, Malwarebytes' director of Mac and mobile and a contributor to the report, told Recode back then. ""There is a rising tide of Mac threats hitting a population that still believes that 'Macs don't get viruses.""
Malware is a widespread problem. Variants of it, including ransomware -- which allows someone to lock up computer files until the victim pays a ransom -- has become a national security threat. Just this month, hackers forced Colonial Pipeline to shut down before paying more than $4.4 million to regain access to its systems. The drama sparked panic buying and gas shortages across the East Coast of the US.
Amid the rising attacks against Mac computers, Apple has been regularly bulking up its security. The company routinely includes new security features in its MacOS software updates, and more are likely to be announced during the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in June.

"Google Nest to integrate with HomeKit, bringing smart home unification one step closer",https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/google-nest-to-integrate-with-homekit-bringing-smart-home-unification-one-step-closer/,"Fri, 28 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    When the connectivity standard known as Matter is released later this year, it could tear down the walls currently dividing smart home ecosystems.
  
According to Google, soon Nest thermostats will be compatible with competing smart home ecosystems like Apple HomeKit. 
In the not-too-distant future, maybe even before 2021 is out, you'll be able to do something no one's ever done before: connect products made by Google Nest with Apple's HomeKit ecosystem, quickly, easily and -- get this -- directly. Or, you might want to incorporate Google devices into your Amazon Alexa-controlled smart home instead. That'll be fine, too. 
In fact, this newfound ability to link previously incompatible devices will work in any direction, meaning you'll also be able to set up Amazon's Ring doorbells or Blink cameras on your Google-based smart home -- and control them the same way you would using Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri.
No janky workarounds, no third-party services like IFTTT to bridge the gap. Just you, your smart home gadgets and the smart home platform of your choosing, all living in harmony.
Sound like fantasy? It won't be, if Google's vision of the smart home's future, outlined in a blog post published last week, comes true. 
Historically, Apple's digital voice assistant Siri hasn't worked well with devices made by Google.
According to Google, communication will eventually open up between Google-made devices and rival companies' smart home ecosystems and products thanks to Google's adoption of a new connectivity standard called Matter, (formerly known as Project CHIP).
""All Nest displays and speakers, like the Nest Hub and Nest Mini, will be automatically updated to control Matter devices,"" according to the blog post. ""Plus, we'll update the newest Nest Thermostat to support Matter -- meaning for the first time it can be controlled on other platforms that have certified with Matter."" 
A glance at Matter's partner list provides a clue as to what ""other platforms"" that may include: Apple's HomeKit, Amazon's Alexa, Samsung's SmartThings -- plus devices and services from the likes of Signify's Philips Hue, Comcast, Huawei and more.
The three-arrow Matter logo shown on this smart light bulb signifies smart-home tech that will work well with other Matter-certified devices.
Google Senior Project Manager Kevin Po confirmed this feature in an interview with CNET. Speaking specifically about the latest Nest Thermostat, he said, ""If a user chooses to have it set up and interoperate with another platform, then we will support them through it.""
When will this brave new world come to fruition? Not until later this year, or maybe even early 2022, according to the Connectivity Standards Alliance, which developed the Matter standard. But preparations are underway already.
Google in particular has gotten out ahead of the pack on this one. The company has detailed some of the steps it's currently taking -- or will take soon -- to ready its Google Nest smart home gadgets and Android mobile operating system for Matter's primetime debut.
Eventually, Google's Android mobile operating system will get Matter integrations that allow for streamlined setup and device controls.
For starters, not only will the entire line of current Google Nest smart speakers and displays receive an update to control Matter devices, some of Google's more well-equipped gadgets will also serve as connection points, aka hubs. 
Basically, the Nest Wifi router, the latest Nest Hub and the flagship Nest Hub Max will use a technology Google helped develop -- called Thread and part of the Matter standard -- to connect to other Thread-enabled devices in a way that's even faster and more secure than Wi-Fi alone.
""Thread is great for low-powered, mesh, reliable, scalable communication,"" said Po. But most mobile devices can't communicate directly with Thread gadgets. ""Say you wanted your phone to interoperate with, say, a Thread device,"" Po added. ""You need a special type of Thread device that can kind of bridge between Wi-Fi and Thread, right, to provide that connectivity."" That's where Thread connection points come in.
The new second-generation Nest Hub uses a technology called Thread to communicate with other Thread-enabled smart home gadgets.
Some other notable strides Google announced include:
Eventually, Google expects to implement the Matter standard deeply within its Android mobile operating system. The goal will be to simplify the Matter-certified smart home device setup process down to just a few taps and to provide ways to instantly control new devices without having to download additional apps.
""With Android, we'll be actually building the Matter functionality into Google Play services, and so it'll effectively be an app that other Android apps can leverage and really kind of make it really easy for a user to set up a Matter device,"" Po said."

    The iPhone maker is also reportedly working on updates to the Mac Pro, iMac and Mac Mini.
  
Apple unveiled its first M1-powered MacBook Air, seen here, in November 2020.
Apple is reportedly preparing to update several of its Mac desktops and laptops with faster chips, new designs and other improvements. Apple's MacBook Pro and MacBook Air laptops as well as its Mac Pro, iMac and Mac Mini desktop computers are all slated for an overhaul, Bloomberg reported Tuesday. 
The revamped MacBook Pro could debut as early as this summer with the updated MacBook Air coming later this year, reported Bloomberg, citing unnamed source familiar with the matter. These will reportedly be followed by an all-new Mac Pro, planned for 2022, as well as a higher-end Mac Mini and a larger iMac. 
All of the devices will feature new processors designed in-house by Apple that will ""greatly outpace the performance and capabilities of the current M1 chips,"" reported Bloomberg. 
Apple's move to drop Intel CPUs for its own silicon started in late 2020 with the M1-powered MacBook Air, Mac Mini and 13-inch MacBook Pro. The company's new 24-inch M1 iMac is available starting Friday, along with the new M1 iPad Pro and Apple TV 4K.
Apple is reportedly planning two different chips for the new MacBook Pro -- both with ""eight high-performance cores and two energy-efficient cores for a total of 10"" but in ""either 16 or 32 graphics core variations,"" according to Bloomberg. The chips will also reportedly feature more memory and improved Neural Engine and enable the addition of more Thunderbolt ports. 
In addition to getting a new processor, Apple's redesigned MacBook Pro will come in 14- and 16-inch sizes, feature a magnetic MagSafe charger and bring back the HDMI port and SD card slot, reports Bloomberg.

iPhone 12 vs. iPhone 11 Pro camera comparison: See why Apple's newest phone wins,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-12-vs-iphone-11-pro-camera-comparison-see-why-apple-newest-phone-wins/,"Tue, 25 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    The iPhone 12 may be cheaper, but its camera quality puts up a fight against last year's flagship.
  
The 
  iPhone 11 Pro
 packed a seriously impressive triple rear camera. It took such great shots in fact that it replaced my DSLR on a road trip around Scotland. Apple's latest 
  iPhone 12
 may be one of the more affordable of the new lineup -- which includes the smaller 
  iPhone 12 Mini
 and the more premium 
  12 Pro
 and 12 Pro Max -- but its camera is even more formidable than last year's.
I took the iPhone 12 for a spin around the beautiful city of Edinburgh, and I've been super impressed with how it stacks up against the previous 11 Pro. Sure, it doesn't have the 2x telephoto lens, but the images it can capture with the standard view and the super-wide lens are superb. 
iPhone 11 Pro, standard lens
iPhone 12, standard lens
On this first scene in Dean Village, both cameras have captured an excellent overall exposure, but the iPhone 12's shot has a richer blue sky and more contrast and detail on the buildings, resulting in a better-looking shot overall. 
iPhone 11 Pro, super-wide lens
iPhone 12, super-wide lens
Switching to the super-wide view, both 
  phones
 have been able to capture a huge amount of the scene in front of them, but again, the iPhone 12 has a bit more punch to the scene. Some of the buildings look a bit darker, however, which may not be to everyone's tastes. 
iPhone 11 Pro, standard lens
iPhone 12, standard lens
While the overall exposure is great on both shots, the bright sky on the iPhone 11 Pro appears to have caused some haziness around where the buildings meet the sky. The iPhone 12's shot has a clear distinction between the areas, which looks much nicer.
iPhone 11 Pro, standard lens
iPhone 12, standard lens
Although the sky doesn't cause the same haze in this scene, there's a noticeable difference in the contrast between the two images. The iPhone 12's shot has richer colors, which helps add some punch to the shadows on the church, as well as help distinguish the various trees from each other further down. 
iPhone 11 Pro, standard lens
iPhone 12, standard lens
In this example, however, I can see almost no discernible differences between the two images. Both are pin-sharp with accurate colors and great contrast. 
iPhone 11 Pro, standard lens
iPhone 12, standard lens
Up on Edinburgh's Calton Hill, I prefer the look of the shot from the iPhone 11 Pro. It has a warmer white balance to it (which may only be caused by the tiny shift in shooting angle) that I think gives a more pleasing tone to the scene and has allowed it to maintain some of the sunset colors in the sky. 
iPhone 11 Pro, standard lens
iPhone 12, standard lens
Looking at the increasing sunset from another direction, both phones have captured the tones and the exposure extremely well. The iPhone 12's shot does have more contrast and clarity on the buildings further in the scene, as well as making them a touch brighter, which I think makes for a superior image.

As the sunset deepened, the phones had to fight harder to keep that bright streak of orange in the sky under control, while still capturing plenty of detail in the foreground. They're both great shots, but the iPhone 12's image again shows brighter details in the building and foreground foliage.

As night began to fall I headed further into the city and found this scene. The 11 Pro has captured a great image overall, but it's clear to see that the iPhone 12's is brighter, with more detail on the cobblestones and on ""The Arches"" sign.

The situation is much the same with these beautiful Christmas decorations, shot using the super-wide lens and the Night mode. The iPhone 12 Pro's shot is brighter, with much more visible detail to be seen.

Taken using Night mode at 10 seconds, both shots have captured an impressive amount of detail in what was such an incredibly dark nighttime scene. The iPhone 12's shot is a touch brighter, however.

Cropping in on the corner of the same images, it's possible to see that the iPhone 12 has been able to capture significantly better detail in the edges of its frame when using Night mode.
In almost every example in this test I prefer the look of the images from the iPhone 12 over those taken on the iPhone 11 Pro. Details are clearer, shots are brighter and more vibrant, and Night mode images have seen huge improvements. It's not such a significant upgrade that it's worth moving from an iPhone 11 Pro to the iPhone 12, but the 12 is the phone to go for if you're looking at upgrading from an earlier handset. 
The only downside to keep in mind is that the iPhone 12 doesn't have the 2x telephoto lens. As a photographer, I love using the zoom on the phone as it allows me to get some really interesting angles on subjects that you can't do with a wide-angle lens. If you're a really dedicated photographer then it's worth considering spending the extra and going for the iPhone 12 Pro or 12 Pro Max, both of which offer the telephoto lens as well as the standard and super-wide views."
"AirTags: How to set up, pair Apple's bite-size trackers",https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/airtags-how-to-set-up-and-pair-apples-bite-sized-trackers/,"Sun, 09 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Apple AirTags look cool and can help you easily find misplaced items. Here's what you need to know about setting up and pairing the trackers.
  
Here's everything to know about how to set up and use your AirTags once you buy them.
Apple's AirTags trackers are handy devices that help make sure you don't lose your belongings. The beacon-style devices work similarly to Tile and Samsung's SmartTag Bluetooth trackers and can help you find lost items like your keys, backpack and more by tracking them with the Find My app. They're compatible with iPhones, iPods and iPads running iOS 14.5 or iPadOS 14.5 or later. 
Apple AirTags cost $29 (£29, AU$45) each or $99 (£99, AU$149) for a pack of four, and have been available to buy since April. You can also find different AirTags accessories like keychains and eyeglasses straps available from third-party sellers such as Belkin. 
But once you get your AirTags, how do you actually use them? Here's what you need to know about getting started with AirTags.

Apple says the AirTags setup is similar to how you activate AirPods. Here's what to do once you've got the devices in hand. 
1. Locate the Find My app on your iPhone or compatible Apple device. The app should be preinstalled, but you'll need to set it up. 
2. Pair your AirTag with your iPhone. All you have to do is bring the AirTag close to your iPhone, and it should connect. 
3. Follow the onscreen steps to name your tagged item (e.g., ""My car keys"" if you're attaching your AirTag to your keys) and register it to your Apple ID.
Pairing your AirTags with your iPhone is easy thanks to Bluetooth technology. 
4. Once the AirTag is paired, you should be able to see it under Items in the app, where you'll be able to see its current or last known location on a map. 
5. Physically attach the AirTag to whatever item you'd like to keep track of -- your keys, your phone, anything. 
One cool feature: If the item you've misplaced is within Bluetooth range, you can use the Find My app to play a sound from the AirTag to help you find it. You can also ask Siri to find the item, and the AirTag will play a sound if it's nearby. If you have an iPhone 11, iPhone 12 or iPhone 13, you'll be able to take advantage of the Precision Finding feature, which can help guide you to the AirTag with more precise directions. 
If you've misplaced your item in a public place, you can place the AirTag in Lost Mode and get notified once it's in range or has been located by the Find My network. If someone finds it, they can tap it using their iPhone or another NFC-capable device (including an Android phone) and be taken to a website to display the contact information for the owner, if you've set that up.

"FaceTime's iOS 15 upgrades: Blur backgrounds and schedule calls, just like in Zoom",https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/facetime-ios-15-upgrades-blur-backgrounds-schedule-calls-just-like-zoom/,"Tue, 08 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    FaceTime will work on Android and Windows, among other new features.
  
Craig Federighi, Apple's head of software, talks up FaceTime updates during Apple's WWDC keynote.
Apple's FaceTime will soon look a lot more like Zoom and Microsoft Teams. The iPhone maker on Monday said it's adding features to its videoconferencing software that will let people schedule calls and even access them via a browser on Google Android and Microsoft Windows devices. The announcement came at Apple's WWDC 2021 keynote.
""You can generate a link for a FaceTime call and share it anywhere,"" Craig Federighi, Apple's head of software, said during the company's Worldwide Developers Conference keynote address. ""It's a terrific way to plan ahead for a call."" (Here's how to join FaceTime calls on Android and Windows devices.) 
Apple also built new features to improve audio in FaceTime. The addition of spatial audio in FaceTime is supposed to make it sound like the people you're talking to are in the same room, and voice isolation on the microphone will dampen ambient noise and prioritize the speakers' voices. 
The aim was to make FaceTime ""more natural, comfortable and lifelike,"" Federighi said. 
Portrait Mode in FaceTime will blur the background and keep the people in focus. 
And SharePlay lets you watch TV shows, TikTok videos and other media with friends over FaceTime. Initial partners include Disney Plus, ESPN Plus, Hulu, HBO Max, MasterClass, NBA, Paramount Plus, Pluto TV, TikTok and Twitch. A new API will let developers make their apps compatible with SharePlay. Everyone on a SharePlay session has to have a subscription to the service for it to work. And the content has to be downloaded locally onto your device, not streamed over the internet. 
Adding new features to FaceTime makes Apple's software better able to compete with Zoom, Teams, Google Hangouts and the various other video calling services out there. As the pandemic has forced millions of people around the globe to work from home for over a year, and kept families and friends apart, videoconferencing has become a vital tool to help people stay connected and get work done. Opening FaceTime to Android and Window users -- albeit via the web, not dedicated apps -- reflects a realization by Apple that to reach more users it needs to expand beyond iPhone, iPad and Mac owners.
""The ability for Apple owners to invite Android and PC customers to FaceTime calls via a browser is an acknowledgement that the pandemic has sparked explosive growth in group video calling,"" noted Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. ""Apple risked being left behind services such as Teams and Zoom; however, browser-based access may not be enough to drive significant adoption. Apple has clearly decided to balance the need for greater competitiveness with its own ecosystem motivations.""
Even though Apple will let Android and Windows users join FaceTime calls, they can't set them up. That requires having an Apple device and Apple account. Android and Windows users accessing a FaceTime call through a browser don't have to have an Apple account, but they can't enter the call until the person who set up the call approves them.
The FaceTime news came as part of Apple's introduction of iOS 15, its new iPhone software. The next release of iOS is one of the most important announcements at WWDC. The company's iPhones are among the most popular smartphones in the world, and it makes iOS updates available to people who own older phones. That means a significant percentage of people in the world likely will use iOS 15 within the next year. Most iPhone owners typically download the latest software within weeks or a few months of its release, helped by the prompts Apple sends them. As of June 3, 90% of all phones introduced within the last four years use iOS 14, the software introduced last fall. 
Apple unveiled the new software Monday during a virtual WWDC, its second in a row. Typically, the company gathers thousands of developers in Northern California to show them its newest software and services that will arrive on devices later in the year, but the COVID-19 pandemic has moved tech events online. The company may be best known for its hardware, but the seamless integration of its hardware with its software is what sets Apple apart from rivals. Apple also has been expanding its services with Apple TV Plus, Apple Fitness Plus, Apple Card, Maps and various other offerings. 
Apple's ability to control every aspect of its products has been key to making it the most powerful company in tech. But that power has invited scrutiny. Apple and Fortnite game developer Epic last month wrapped up a trial over App Store policies, and a district court judge will now decide if Apple's policies and the 30% commission it takes on purchases inside apps are illegal. At the same time, regulators around the world and in the US are weighing whether Big Tech companies -- including Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon -- have become too big and powerful. And an App Tracking Transparency privacy update in iOS 14.5, which requires apps to ask permission to track users for ads, has angered Facebook and other developers who make their money from advertising. "
Apple TV Plus free trial period drops from one year to three months,https://www.cnet.com/tech/home-entertainment/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-period-drops-from-one-year-to-three-months/,"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Starting July 1, subscribers will only get three months of free service with their device purchase, down from a full year.
  
Starting July 1, Apple will reduce the length of its Apple TV Plus free trial period from a year to just three months for those customers who buy an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, iPod Touch or Mac. Although the change to the promotion length was previously known, the change appeared on the company's website this week, which now offers one free year of service only to those who subscribe and purchase a qualifying device before June 30. 
As CNET's Joan Solsman notes, one analyst estimates that 62% of Apple TV Plus accounts are in the promotional period. After the trial period expires, the service costs $5 a month. Earlier this year, Apple TV Plus announced that the second season of one of its headlining original shows, Ted Lasso, would not premier until July 23.

    Apple's Wallet app is taking big steps towards replacing your actual wallet. Here's what we heard at WWDC.
  
Apple's Wallet app will be able to store driver's licenses in iOS 15. 
Apple's Wallet app is getting a big upgrade in iOS 15. At Apple's WWDC keynote on Monday, Apple announced that it will be adding support for hotel keys and driver's licenses to help ditch more physical cards. Jennifer Bailey, Apple's vice president of Wallet and Apple Pay, says that the company is working with hotel company Hyatt to enable virtual room keys in ""over 1,000 properties worldwide"" this fall. 
The new update also includes the ability to store keys for a home, if you have a smart lock, and corporate badges for entering an office.
While the new features will come in iOS 15, the exact functionality will vary based on your location. The driver's license feature, for example, will allow you to scan your license or state ID into your phone in ""participating"" US states, as not every state supports virtual identity cards today.

When it's enabled, the new IDs should function the same as a physical ID card. Bailey noted that the TSA is ""working to enable airport security checkpoints as the first place you can use your digital ID.""
Bailey says that the identity cards are stored in the iPhone and Apple Watch's ""secure element,"" the same hardware it uses for saving credit cards and other sensitive data. "
"Should you buy a new Mac now, or should you wait?",https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/should-you-buy-a-new-mac-computer-now-or-should-you-wait/,"Sat, 26 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    After the WWDC 2021 keynote, the ""Pro"" audience is still looking for updates.
  
At Apple's WWDC 2021 keynote, new Mac hardware was nowhere to be seen. After a seven-month stretch that brought us new M1-powered laptops and desktops, there's still been no official announcement of an Apple silicon Mac Pro, larger-screen MacBook Pro or 27-inch iMac (although some rumors have popped up).
As part of its aggressive move away from Intel-powered computers, the company introduced a MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro and Mac Mini desktop using its own M1 processors in late 2020. In April 2021, the smaller of two iMac desktop models was redesigned with a larger 24-inch screen, an M1 chip and a new, colorful body. The last new Intel-powered Mac to be announced was the Intel Core i9 27-inch iMac in the summer of 2020, which was most notable for adding an excellent 1080p webcam, a version of which is now in the 24-inch iMac. 
But left out of the first two rounds of M1 Macs were systems for the kind of high-end creative professionals who rely on the more powerful Mac Pro or 16-inch MacBook Pro. The M1 Macs are currently limited to 16GB of RAM and don't offer the discrete AMD graphics cards available in some Intel-powered Macs. 
With WWDC so focused on developers, it would have been the perfect time to introduce new Mac hardware for these power users, but it was not to be. New MacBook Pro models, potentially in 14- and 16-inch versions are still a possibility for this summer or later in 2021. 
With new MacOS updates and potential upcoming hardware in mind, here's where each of the current Macs sit in the lineup, and who should consider buying now and who should consider waiting. 
The M1 MacBook Air.
With the latest M1 version, introduced in late 2020, the classic $999 MacBook Air once again became one of the most universally useful laptops you can buy. It has essentially the same M1 CPU as the 13-inch Pro and 24-inch iMac, along with excellent battery life and a slim, light design. The biggest performance differences among M1 systems come from seven- versus eight-core graphics built into the M1, and the additional performance overhead available in systems with fans, like the MacBook Pro and 24-inch iMac, which lets systems run hotter, longer. 
For students, writers, work-from-home types and most mainstream users, I still think the MacBook Air represents a great value and a good place to start (and maybe finish) your hunt for a new computer. 
Read more: MacBook Air M1 review: Big changes from Apple silicon
My take on the M1 13-inch MacBook Pro has not changed much since it was introduced last year. With essentially identical performance to the less-expensive Air, you're paying for a slightly brighter screen, the Touch Bar and fan-based cooling. Unless you're a Touch Bar fan, I'd stick with the Air. 
The 16-inch Pro remains an Intel-only system, and can ramp up to 64GB of RAM and an AMD 5600M GPU, making it much more suitable for true ""pro"" users who are holding off on an Apple silicon Mac until there's something like the rumored M2 version with GPU support. 
Apple's M1 Mac Mini. 
The often-overlooked Mac Mini is the least-expensive way to get both a MacOS system and an M1 device. In testing, we found it offers performance on par with or slightly better than the M1 MacBook Pro, which costs nearly twice as much. But the Mac Mini is also a niche product. It's great if you're working on not-too-taxing video work or podcasting and want to use your own display and input devices. It's a great computer for small production studios, because it can be tucked away almost anywhere. 
The 24-inch iMac is the first Mac designed from the ground up as an M1 system, and also the first major design update to the iMac line in about eight years. While it doesn't move the bar on performance or component options from the earlier M1 Macs, the excellent camera, much lighter weight and smaller, smarter-looking design all come together to make this a great family or home office computer. I'd consider it best for the work-from-home type who wants a bigger screen.

The Mac Pro feels like a lifetime away from something like the MacBook Air. It's been through so many completely different iterations over the years, from the trash can mini-desktop to the current industrial tower design. Starting at $6,000, no one is going to confuse this for one the M1 Macs. It starts with Intel Xeon processors and offers various AMD Radeon GPUs and up to 1.5TB of RAM (which is literally a $25,000 upgrade). And don't forget the $400 wheels. 
My advice as of right now is that, if you're waiting for an AMD-equipped pro-level new Mac, either go with the still-available Intel versions, which will be supported for years to come, or keep waiting to see what happens later in 2021. If you're a student or casual user who has been waiting to buy a new MacBook, I can safely say that after seven months, I've only had a couple of very minor compatibility issues with the M1 MacBook Air, and it is hands-down my pick for the most practical Mac. I'm still waiting for a 27-inch version of the sleek new iMac, but the 24-inch model has almost everything else I want, as long as you're ok with the smaller screen. "
Siri's 4 new voices: Here's where to find them and how to make the switch,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/siri-4-new-voices-heres-where-to-find-them-and-how-to-make-the-switch/,"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Apple's smart assistant no longer defaults to a female voice. As of iOS 14.5 you can choose from a few brand-new voice options.
  
Siri got a new look with iOS 14, and now it's getting new voices in iOS 14.5.
The overall sound of Apple's digital assistant, Siri, has more or less remained the same since it made its debut alongside the iPhone 4S nearly a decade ago. (Hard to believe it was that long ago, isn't it?) But that changed earlier this year when Apple released iOS 14.5 and iPadOS 14.5, adding two new voices and no longer setting the default option to a female voice when you set up a new Apple device. 
All four voices sound amazing, adding more personality to your interactions with the virtual person living inside your iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch. More importantly, they're a welcome break from the standard Siri voice, variety being the spice of life. 
Making the switch is easy, you just have to know where to look. Better yet? After you go through the new options and make your selection, that voice will sync to all of your Apple devices automatically. Here's how you can get a new Siri in a couple of minutes.
Ready for a new-sounding Siri? 
According to Apple, the first time you set up a new device you'll be asked which voice you want Siri to use. It's the first time Apple hasn't made a female voice the default for its digital assistant. If you're like me and don't plan on getting a new iPhone anytime soon, but you do want to change Siri's voice after installing iOS 14.5, here's where you can find the option. 
Open the Settings app, then go to Siri & Search > Siri Voice. Under the Voice section you'll find four different options. Voice 2 and Voice 3 are new, but to my ear all four sound more natural and realistic. Don't you think?  
Tap each voice to hear a preview. Switching to a new voice will require your iPhone or iPad to download the necessary files to make the swap. You'll see Downloading… with a loading animation on each voice as you select it. Once the download is complete, your device will start using that voice going forward. 
My pick out of the new bunch is Voice 3. It's a fun change from the standard female Siri voice I've used all these years. To my surprise, my selection synced to the rest of my Apple devices, like my Apple Watch and iPad Pro, as well. The change didn't make its way to my HomePod, however. Not sure what I need to do to get the proper voice there. 
The new voices are currently available in English, but I have to think Apple is working on adding more languages. Apple didn't mention anything about more languages in iOS 15, which is currently available to developers as a beta. It will officially launch later this year, but in the meantime, make sure you soak in as much information about iOS 14 as possible. We have plenty of tips and tricks and hidden features for you to check out."

    Microsoft improves its Teams video-calling software to better stack up against FaceTime.
  
On Thursday at Microsoft's Windows 11 virtual launch event, the company gave its Teams software and upcoming OS a big upgrade. As part of the new operating system, users will have fast access to Teams video conferencing. 
Teams will live right in the Windows taskbar. It's the first time Teams will be tightly integrated into Windows. So launching a video call should be as simple as, say, opening FaceTime in MacOS.
Microsoft Teams will work across multiple types of devices.
In fact, according to the company, users should be able to access Teams regardless of their chosen platform. That includes Mac, iOS, Android and Windows PCs. 
Starting with Windows 11, Microsoft also will partner with the Amazon app store. This will allow users to download Android apps through that service plus run them natively. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella even went so far as to invite Apple's iMessage to join the new Microsoft app store.
Microsoft expects to roll out Windows 11 in time for the holiday season. And all current PCs running Windows 10 will have access to the upgrade for free.  "
Apple FaceTime getting spatial audio for 'more natural' calls,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/apple-facetime-getting-spatial-audio-for-more-natural-calls/,"Mon, 07 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Apple says that as part of the iOS 15 update, FaceTime users' voices will appear to come out of the screen on supported Apple devices.
  
Apple has announced that as part of the update to iOS 15, FaceTime will offer spatial audio to make people's voices appear to come from their position on screen, during its annual WWDC keynote.
The feature is designed to make FaceTime ""more natural, comfortable and lifelike,"" Apple's Craig Federighi said.
Spatial audio is a collection of 3D surround formats, including Dolby Atmos, designed to bring height and rear effects to video calls, movies and music. Apple introduced spatial audio on its AirPods Pro last year and it uses the headphones' accelerometer for head tracking. 
It's also supported by AirPods and Beats headphones with an H1 or W1 chip, or the built-in speakers in the latest versions of the iPhone, iPad and Mac.
In iOS 15, Apple also upgraded FaceTime to allow Android users to join FaceTime calls (here's how).

    Apple continues its back and forth with employees over remote work requests.
  
Apple's secretive culture has survived the pandemic, but the company wants to push back to in-person work.
Apple's corporate culture is well known throughout Silicon Valley as hard charging and secretive. It may also soon be seen as unforgiving, too. The company's head of people, Deirdre O'Brien, reportedly dismissed requests from seemingly thousands of Apple employees for the company to reconsider its remote work policies. 
Earlier this month, the company told employees it expects them to be in the office at least three days a week. In a video posted internally at Apple and cited by a Wednesday report in The Verge, O'Brien said the company believes ""in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future."" She added that the successful product launches of the past year ""were built upon the base of years of work that we did when we were all together in-person."" 
Read more: Apple employees want more remote-work flexibility post-COVID
The Verge report didn't say whether O'Brien acknowledged how well Apple's teams worked remotely. The report also didn't say whether she'd mentioned that the company notched its highest revenue and profit nearly a year after countries around the world began a series of lockdowns and quarantines in efforts to slow the spreading coronavirus pandemic. Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Apple's pushback marks the latest battle between tech companies and their employees over the future of how they'll work. Despite a banner year for each company's business by nearly any financial metric, Facebook, Google and Apple in particular have found themselves fighting with employees about plans to return to the office. Before the companies solidified policies about when and how remote work would transition back to the office, many staff began to push back. Some moved away from Silicon Valley, and others had grown accustomed to spending more time with their children. Many simply realized that they could do their work without having to endure the San Francisco Bay Area's notorious hours-long commutes.
Apple hasn't publicly responded to the pushback. John Gruber, a longtime blogger who's frequently invited to Apple events and has spoken with Apple executives, argued that the employee complaints are signs the company is hiring people ""who aren't a good fit for Apple.""
""And who are these people who took jobs at Apple not knowing the company's on-site culture?"" he wrote earlier this month. ""Do they think Apple built a new $4 billion campus on a lark?"" On Wednesday, he pushed further in response to O'Brien's video, saying Apple's decision about remote work ""was made"" and that he agrees with her statements.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has told employees he'll allow them to work from more locations throughout the US, and he's said he expects up to half of his workforce to work remotely in the next 10 years. But he also threatened to decrease their pay in response. Google has gone a step further, releasing an official app internally to indicate how much an employee's salary may drop if they continue to work remotely from various parts of the country.
Apple hasn't threatened employee's paystubs in its internal debates, but it has struggled with some team leaders being unforgiving to staff facing stress from the pandemic.

One Apple employee who was struggling to care for a young family amid school shutdowns, said a manager expected full-time work or none at all, despite the company's flexible COVID-era policies. That employee's experience doesn't appear to have been an isolated case.
In a letter published by The Verge earlier this month that was addressed to company executives in response to its return-to-work policies, Apple employees pleaded with the company to offer more flexible work options and better work-life balance.
""Many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, or being a part of Apple,"" the Apple employees said. ""This is ... a decision many would prefer not to have to make."""
We took the iPhone 12 down to 65 feet underwater in Lake Tahoe,https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/iphone-12-water-test-how-deep-can-apples-phone-really-go/,"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    We dunked Apple's iPhone 12 in the chilly, deep waters of Lake Tahoe to find out what would happen.
  
Apple's iPhone 12 is water-resistant, so it should be totally fine if you accidentally drop it in the pool or it gets splashed with liquid. The iPhone 12's IP68 rating means it can survive up to 19.6 feet (six meters) of water for 30 minutes. But how deep can you really take this phone? We took a brand-new iPhone 12 for a swim in the frigid fresh water of Lake Tahoe, California, to find out. Turns out that like its predecessor, Apple's newest iPhone can handle a great deal more than its official rating.
To test out the water resistance, we teamed up with Mission Robotics to mount our iPhone 12 on the company's underwater drone, Theseus. The drone can go as deep as 984 feet (300 meters) underwater; the pilot can see the view from Theseus' camera, as well as monitoring depth and water temperature metrics from a computer on shore. 
Although we only tested the regular iPhone 12, Apple's IP68 water resistance rating applies to all four iPhone 12 models: the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Watch the video on this page for the full test and to see some amazing underwater footage from the drone.

According to Apple's support page, you shouldn't intentionally submerge or swim with your iPhone, or take it to extreme temperatures. But for the purposes of our test, we wanted to push it to the limits.
For our first dive, we wanted to test the IP68 claim: 19.6 feet (6 meters) of water for 30 minutes. From the shore of Lake Tahoe, we positioned the iPhone on a mount facing the drone's camera with the screen set to stay on, so we could see if anything happened to the iPhone while it was underwater. 
The iPhone 12 on Theseus.
The water temperature in Lake Tahoe at this depth was 52 degrees Fahrenheit (11 degrees Celsius).
Once the 30 minutes were up, we pulled the phone out of the water and dried it off with a cloth. Then we tested it out to see if the phone was working. The touchscreen was fine and the volume rocker worked as expected. All three cameras (front, ultrawide and wide) looked clear with no evidence of fogging and the photos looked normal. We recorded a voice memo before dunking the phone and could hear that the speaker sounded a little muffled in comparison after the first dive, but it's hard to tell whether that would've improved after letting it dry out longer. Apple's support page suggests placing the iPhone's base and Lightning connector in front of a fan to help the drying process. We had other ideas, however.
With the iPhone 12 working as normal, we got the drone ready for its second dive in Lake Tahoe. This time, we wanted to take the phone to more extreme depths. We submerged the phone to 65 feet (20 meters) underwater, more than three times the maximum depth rating. The water temperature at this depth was 50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius).
With the timer running on the iPhone 12's screen, we could see how much time had elapsed since we submerged the phone. Once it hit 30 minutes, we decided to leave it submerged a little longer just to see what would happen. We finally pulled the drone out of the water at the 40-minute mark and ran through the same tests again. 
Surprisingly, everything worked as normal. The screen was responsive, the volume and power buttons worked, and the two cameras were in working order as well. The speaker still sounded muffled when playing back the voice memo, but it was still audible.
After wiping down the iPhone 12, we powered it down and let it sit for a few days to let it dry out completely. 
After letting it dry out for 72 hours, we wanted to do one final test to see if there had been any long-term damage as a result of the extreme underwater test. The phone itself was completely dry, but its three lenses -- the ultrawide and wide-angle on the back, as well as the front camera -- had developed some fogging.
At this point the battery had also completely drained, so we let the phone juice up for a while via the Lightning port before powering it back on. But once we did, the iPhone 12's screen showed a Diagnostics prompt. After trying to get through the Diagnostics prompt a few times, we plugged the iPhone 12 into a MacBook to see if we could reset the device. It worked, but we still couldn't get past the Diagnostics screens.
While we have no way of knowing exactly what caused this error to happen, it may have been lingering water damage, the shift in temperature between the cold water of Lake Tahoe to an indoor environment, or a combination of both. To see how the iPhone 12 fared a few weeks after submerging it in the lake, watch the video where we crack it open below.
Our highly unscientific test would suggest that the iPhone 12 can withstand very deep water and clearly meets the IP68 claim. But like all electronics, it does have a limit to how much water it can take -- and you should never intentionally submerge the phone in water (lake or otherwise).
As with our earlier water experiment with the iPhone 11, your results may vary. Also remember that water damage is not covered under warranty. We contacted Apple and the company pointed us toward these instructions on its support page. Following these guidelines may improve your iPhone's chances in the event that it comes into contact with water or any other kind of liquid."
"Apple M1 Macs get a fast, new version of Adobe Lightroom Classic",https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-m1-macs-get-a-fast-new-version-of-adobe-lightroom-classic/,"Tue, 08 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Adobe also taps into Apple's hardware for accelerating AI.
  
Apple's 2020 13-inch MacBook Air was one in the first crop of computers to be powered by the company's M1 processor.
Adobe released on Tuesday its first Lightroom Classic version adapted for Macs powered by the new M1 processor, a boon to photographers who want to get more use out of Apple's energy efficient hardware.
The new software sports a major new feature: the ability to quadruple a photo's size with Adobe Super Resolution technology. Super Resolution, which debuted in Photoshop in March, lets photographers zoom in on distant subjects or print photos in larger sizes. The feature is available for all versions of Lightroom but gets a particular boost on M1 Macs because Adobe is tapping into AI-accelerating Neural Engine circuitry that Apple built into its processors.
Adobe announced its M1 progress during Apple's 2021 WWDC conference for developers. Adapting software for M1 Macs is a major focus for developers as Apple progresses through a two-year replacement of Intel-based machines.
Apple began selling M1-powered MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro laptops in 2020 and brought the chip to new iMacs in May. Apple's M-series chip family, which is replacing Intel processors in Macs, is a close cousin to the A-series chips that power iPhones and iPads.
To get the most out of M1 chips' performance and battery-saving abilities, software like Lightroom has to be rebuilt for the processor. Although Apple's Rosetta 2 technology can translate Intel Mac software to run on M1 Macs, full performance comes when the software instructions are native to the M1. Adobe supplies software to both professionals and consumers, so its products are among the most important making this change.
Photoshop is Adobe's top product, but Lightroom is widely used by photographers to edit and catalog their photos. Lightroom comes in two versions: Lightroom, which stores your photo catalog in the cloud, and Lightroom Classic, which adds many advanced features and stores photos on your computer. Adobe released M1-native Lightroom in December and Photoshop followed in March.
Lightroom isn't the only Adobe software transitioning to the M1 environment. The company also said on Tuesday that it would roll out M1-native versions of its Illustrator design software and InDesign layout software. Its Premiere Pro video editing software for M1 Macs is available as a public beta test version. 
Third-party test results by Pfeiffer Consulting show Apple's 13-inch M1-based MacBook Pro outpaces the same-size Intel-based model using a quad-core Intel Core i5 processor on many tasks. For example, Lightroom's new AI-powered Super Resolution feature took 10 seconds to convert a 12-megapixel photo into a 48-megapixel photo on the M1 machine but 36 seconds on the Intel machine.
""On average, based on 10 different workflow benchmarks, Lightroom Classic on the Apple M1 system showed over 2x performance gains over the Intel system,"" said Pfeiffer, which was commissioned by Adobe to conduct the tests. 
For the Premiere Pro beta, Pfeiffer reported a 78% speed boost for M1 Macs across a variety of tests. With Illustrator, the advantage was 65%, and for Photoshop, it was 89%.
Benchmark tests require a lot of caveats. One is that many Mac owners use MacBooks with more powerful Intel Core i7 chips employing six or eight processing cores that would put up a better fight against the M1 Macs. But those are available only in Apple's 16-inch MacBook Pros, which aren't on the market yet with M-series processors. 
Subscribers to the mobile and PC versions of Lightroom also now get seven photographers' collections of portrait editing presets tailored for a range of skin tones. One batch of presets from Aundre Larrow, who's offered advice on photographing people with darker skin and who helps on the set of United Shades of America, is also included in the free version of Lightroom for mobile devices."
