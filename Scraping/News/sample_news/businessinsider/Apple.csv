Apple surpasses Amazon as world's most valuable brand,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-surpasses-amazon-as-worlds-most-valuable-brand-2021-1,"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"For the first time in five years, the Apple brand is the most valuable in the world at $263.4 billion, surpassing Amazon and Google, according to a ranking from Brand Finance Global 500.
Apple's diversification strategy paid off, as the brand increased 87% in value last year, according to the ranking, which was first reported by MarketWatch. With Tim Cook at the helm, the brand has expanded beyond the iPhone, into services like the App Store, iCloud, Apple Podcasts, Music, TV, and Arcade. The company is reportedly planning to make a self-driving electric car by 2024.
Five years ago, the iPhone accounted for two-thirds of Apple's sales, but in 2020 it accounted for just half. With regard to the Apple brand's growth and diversification, Brand Finance Chief Executive David High said, ""We are witnessing it think different once again. From Mac to iPod, to iPhone, to iPad, to Apple Watch, to subscription services, to infinity and beyond.""
The tech giant is slated to report its first quarter earnings Wednesday after the market close, and analysts are expecting revenues to top the $100 billion mark for the first time in its history, with strong iPhone 12 sales to thank. After the company passed a record $2 trillion market capitalization in August, analysts are predicting the $3 trillion mark is within reach in the next 12 months.

Amazon, which now ranks second according to the report, is now valued at $254.2 billion. The 15% increase came as the company largely benefited from sales boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic as consumers stayed at home and shopped online. Google is ranked third, as it faced its first-ever revenue decline during the pandemic.
Tesla, meanwhile, took the top spot as the fastest-growing brand in the world. As other automakers struggled last year, Tesla benefited from strong sales and ramped up deliveries. The electric car-maker, which will report its fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, is expected to close out on an historic 2020 with its first fiscal year of profitability.

"Apple, Google Sued for Hosting Telegram App After Capitol Riots",https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-google-alphabet-telegram-app-store-2021-1,"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"A former US ambassador is suing Apple and Alphabet for hosting the encrypted messaging platform Telegram on their app stores, claiming it is ""being used to intimidate, threaten and coerce members of the public."" 
Marc Ginsberg, once US ambassador to Morocco, filed the suits on behalf of his organization, the Coalition for a Safer Web, which advocates for greater regulation of extremist content online. 
The move comes weeks after both firms banned Parler, the alternative messaging service popular with conservatives, for continuing to allow ""violence-inciting content"" in the wake of the storming of the US Capitol. 
Encrypted messaging apps Telegram and Signal each saw a significant uptick in downloads after the Parler bans occurred, peaking at 9 million and 7.5 million a week, respectively. 
Unlike Facebook or Twitter, private messages on Telegram face little risk of moderation. The firm was founded in 2013 by Pavel Durov and is based in Dubai.
In Telegram channels reviewed by Insider in the wake of the riots at the US Capitol, users voiced their desire for further violence and real-world action ahead of President Biden's inauguration.

In a complaint against Apple filed with the Northern District court in California last week, Ginsberg claims to have suffered ""economic losses as well as emotional distress"" after being subjected to anti-Semitic abuse organized through Telegram. 
""Ambassador Ginsberg created the Coalition for a Safer Web to compel social media platforms to end their tolerance of anti-Semitism as well as their enabling of extremist groups to operate with impunity over social media,"" the suit reads. 
Bloomberg later reported that Ginsburg had filed a similar suit against Google's parent company Alphabet, in which he likewise alleged that Google ""has not taken any action against Telegram comparable to the action it has taken against Parler to compel Telegram to improve its content moderation policies.""
In both suits, Ginsburg claims Telegram was used to facilitate ""anti-Semitic and anti-Black extremism and violence during the Black Lives Matter (""BLM"") protests throughout summer of 2020."" 
""Telegram's media platform and services provide tremendous utility and value to racist and anti-Semitic groups as a tool to connect its members and to facilitate these group's ability to communicate, recruit members, plan and carry out attacks, and strike fear in its enemies.""
A Telegram spokesperson said: ""Our moderation team is constantly monitoring public activity on the platform, processing reports from users as well as proactively removing public calls for violence
""In January, over 3,000 public communities were banned for violating the company's ""no calls for violence"" policy globally. Less than 6% of the calls for violence around the world that were taken down in January were related to events in the US. Overall, less than 2% of Telegram's monthly active users are from the United States.""
Insider approached Google, Apple, and the Coalition for a Safer Web for further comment.

Apple hardware executive Dan Riccio is taking on a 'new project' at the company,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-dan-riccio-hardware-engineering-chief-transition-to-new-project-2021-1,"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple hardware chief Dan Riccio is stepping down from his role to transition to a new position as part of ""a new project,"" Apple said in a press release on Monday. He will still report to CEO Tim Cook.
John Ternus will take over as the company's senior vice president of hardware engineering after acting as vice president since 2013. He joined the company's product design team in 2001, per the release, and oversaw the development of the iPhone 12 line.
Read more: Apple is reportedly ramping up its electric vehicle project. Here are the 3 auto companies that are most likely to build the car, experts say.
""Every innovation Dan has helped Apple bring to life has made us a better and more innovative company, and we're thrilled that he'll continue to be part of the team,"" Cook said in the press release. ""John's deep expertise and wide breadth of experience make him a bold and visionary leader of our Hardware Engineering teams.""
Riccio has been at Apple since 1998, according to his LinkedIn profile, and played a role in the company's iPad hardware engineering. He took over as Senior Vice President of Hardware Engineering after Bob Mansfield left the role in 2012.
Riccio's new role or the project he will be working on was not disclosed, but he will be a vice president of the engineering division moving forward, per Mac Rumors.
The job transition announcement comes as Apple is rumored to be working on an electric vehicle.
Reuters reported last month that Apple is aiming for a 2024 release date, and Bloomberg reported that timeline to be anywhere between 2025 and 2027. Experts say Tesla, Volkswagen, and Magna Steyr are the most automakers most likely to build Apple's electric car. Hyundai has said it was also in talks with the company to take on the project.

Qualcomm will pay $1.4 billion for startup founded by ex-Apple employees,https://www.businessinsider.com/qualcomm-acquired-a-startup-founded-by-ex-apple-employees,"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider," 
Qualcomm Technologies has announced it will acquire Nuvia, a two-year-old chip startup company established by former Apple executives, for $1.4 billion.
The California-based chipmaker said Wednesday it plans to use Nuvia's technology in its flagship smartphones, next-generation laptops, auto components and other electronics gear.  
The acquisition agreement comes as Qualcomm doubles-down on chip performance and consumer demand grows for more powerful mobile computing with the rollout of the faster and more reliable 5G wireless networks. 
Read more: What is 5G? Here's what you need to know about the latest cellular network generation
It also comes during a period of change at Qualcomm. Earlier this month, the company announced Steve Mollenkopf was retiring as CEO and will be replaced by current President Cristiano Amon. Mollenkopf has worked for the chip-making giant for 26 years, and became CEO in 2014.
Nuvia founders Gerard Williams III, John Bruno, Manu Gulati, and their employees will be joining Qualcomm, according to the press release. 
Nuvia has been developing custom CPU core design for servers, but Qualcomm said it intends to inter grate the technology broadly. ""NUVIA CPUs are expected to be integrated across Qualcomm Technologies' broad portfolio of products, powering flagship smartphones, next-generation laptops, and digital cockpits, as well as Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, extended reality and infrastructure networking solutions,"" the press release said. 
In 2019, Apple filed a lawsuit against one of Nuvia's founders Gerad Williams III who was a former Apple employee and left the company after over nine years as chief architect for the customer processors that power iPhones and iPads to start Nuvia.
The lawsuit alleged that Williams breached an intellectual property agreement and a duty of loyalty to Apple by launching Nuvia while on company time at Apple and speaking with colleagues who eventually joined the startup.
In January 2020, Judge Mark H. Pierce issued a tentative ruling barring Apple from seeking punitive damages but allowing the case to proceed regardless. Later that month, Williams failed to persuade the court to dismiss Apple's complaint accusing him of using company resources to create Nuvia, according to Bloomberg.
Apple engaged in a legal battle with Qualcomm as well. In 2019, both companies settled their disputes over Qualcomm's patent licensing practices that went on for two years.
In September 2020, Nuvia said it raised $240 million in a Series B round led by Mithril Capital and Sehat Sutardja and Weili Dai, founders of Marvell Technology Group.

Apple CEO Tim Cook says Trump should be held accountable for the Capitol Hill riots: 'No one is above the law',https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-tim-cook-trump-should-be-accountable-capitol-siege-2021-1,"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple CEO Tim Cook says President Donald Trump should be held accountable for the riots on Capitol Hill last week. 
In an interview with ""CBS This Morning"" that aired Tuesday, host Gayle King asked Cook where he stands on the issue of Trump's role in the insurrection, which resulted in five deaths and dozens of arrests. The brief interview was part of a larger story that will air on the program Wednesday morning. 
""I think no one is above the law,"" Cook said. ""I mean, that's the great thing about our country, we're a rule of law country. I think everyone that had a part in it needs to be held accountable."" 
""I don't think we should let it go,"" Cook added.

Cook spoke out on Twitter following the riots last Wednesday, tweeting that the day was ""a sad and shameful chapter in our nation's history.""
And over the weekend, Apple banned the social media app Parler from the App Store after it failed to remove content that promoted violence. Parler, which bills itself as a ""free speech"" app, has surged in popularity among Trump's supporters and members of the far-right after mainstream social media apps began to crack down on hate-speech and misinformation. The app was used to coordinate the attacks in Washington, DC. 
""We have always supported diverse points of view being represented on the App Store, but there is no place on our platform for threats of violence and illegal activity,"" Apple said in a statement at the time. ""Parler has not taken adequate measures to address the proliferation of these threats to people's safety.""

"Does Apple Music Have Podcasts? Not Really, and Here's Why",https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/streaming/does-apple-music-have-podcasts,"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"iTunes helped revolutionize the digital music and streaming experience. But with the macOS Catalina upgrade, Apple ushered in a new era for media platforms. While the iTunes media library once boasted an array of tracks and albums from independent artists to musical titans, it also featured videos, podcasts, and audiobooks.  
The update to Catalina, however, introduced four separate apps: Apple Music, Apple TV, Apple Podcasts, and Apple Books. This shift toward standalone apps has left some wondering if there's any overlap in content, including whether there are podcasts on Apple Music. 
Here's what you need to know about Apple music and podcasts. 
While Apple Music contains more than 50 million songs from artists of all genres, fans of podcasts will need to download Apple Podcasts. This app is for fans of the format and boasts millions of episodes of recorded shows for users to listen, subscribe to, and download for free. While you might find random episodes of a few podcasts in Apple Music, this genre isn't a feature of the program and Apple directs listeners to Podcasts for this reason.
As long as you have an iPhone, iPad, or iPod, you can download Apple Podcasts from the App Store and begin subscribing to your favorite shows right away (it might also already be downloaded as a default app on your home screen). The subscribe feature allows users to be notified every time a new episode of that podcast is available. You can also access podcasts through Mac computers running iOS Catalina as well as on your Apple TV. 
There are a wide variety of podcasts to choose from, from science, history, and news topics to scripted fiction, comedy, meditation, and panel discussion. Some podcasts choose to focus on true crime stories while others focus in on topics such as baking or TV shows like ""The Walking Dead."" 
Should you come across a podcast you like, simply tap on it, then tap the ""Subscribe"" button to receive updates for when new episodes are available. If you have an active internet connection when listening, you can simply tap a given episode to listen right away.
Otherwise, if you plan to listen while on a long-haul flight or when on vacation with no service, you can tap the plus symbol to download the episode for offline listening.

Here's Which Apple Watches Work With Which iPhones,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/what-apple-watches-work-with-which-iphones,"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The Apple Watch does a lot more than just tell the time. When paired with an iPhone, the Watch can send texts, make calls, act as your credit card, play music from anywhere, and more.
Unfortunately, not much of this works without an iPhone. And even more unfortunately, not every Apple Watch works with every iPhone.
The Apple Watch was designed to be a companion to your iPhone. This means that if you don't have the right phone, your Watch will be just that — a watch.
As of this writing, Apple only sells three types of Apple Watches: The Apple Watch Series 3, Series 6, and SE. That said, if you go to a third-party seller, you can easily find other models (like 2019's Series 5).
Keep in mind, however, that these other models aren't supported by Apple anymore. This means that they might not be able to run all apps, or install all watchOS updates.
Here's a rundown of every Apple Watch ever released, and what kind of iPhone (and version of iOS) you'll need to unlock all their features.
Quick tip: If you're not sure what type of iPhone you currently have, or what version of iOS you're running, you can check easily.
Open your Settings app and tap ""General."" Then tap ""About"" at the top of the page. In the list that appears, the type of iPhone you have will be listed next to ""Model Name."" The current iOS version will be listed next to ""Software Version.""


The first Apple Watch came out in early 2015, in gold and rose gold with a black or white cap. You can snatch some versions for less than $100, but it comes without GPS.
The 1st Generation Apple Watch will work with an iPhone 5 or newer, running iOS 8.2 or newer.
Series 1 released in 2016 with less aesthetic options, and no built-in GPS.
The Apple Watch Series 1 will work with an iPhone 5 or newer, with at least iOS 11 installed.
Series 2, also released in 2016, came with a built-in GPS and water resistance up to 50 meters, the current standard for Apple Watches.
The Apple Watch Series 2 will work with an iPhone 5 or newer, with at least iOS 11 installed.
The Series 3 is still being sold today. At $199, it's the cheapest available but has the fewest features. 
When it was originally released, you could buy an Apple Watch Series 3 with cellular capabilities — this lets you send messages or make calls even when away from your iPhone. Apple doesn't sell the cellular version of the Watch anymore, but you can buy it from third-party sellers.
The Apple Watch Series 3 requires an iPhone 6s or newer, running at least iOS 14. Some older, used models may be compatible with iPhone 6 and older iOS versions, but that's not a sure thing.
Series 4, released in 2018, also came in a cellular and non-cellular version.
The Apple Watch Series 4 requires an iPhone 6 or newer with iOS 12 or newer.
The Series 5 introduced a built-in compass, emergency calling, and the bright, ""always-on"" retina display later used for the Series 6. 
This Apple Watch needs an iPhone 6s or newer with iOS 13 or newer.
At $399, the Series 6 is the priciest current model. This model is perfect for health nuts, as it monitors your blood oxygen level and includes an electrocardiogram app.
This Apple Watch requires an iPhone 6s or newer, running iOS 14 or newer.
The Apple Watch SE has many of the same features as the Series 6, but with a lighter price tag ($279).
This Apple Watch requires an iPhone 6s or newer, running iOS 14 or newer.

"Trump's executive disclosures show $6,000 gift from Tim Cook",https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-gift-from-apple-ceo-tim-cook-mac-pro-computer-2021-1,"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider," 
President Donald Trump famously declined to release his tax returns — even after The New York Times did it for him. But his executive-branch financial disclosures released Wednesday, provide a window into Trump's assets and liabilities and a snapshot of several gifts he accepted during his time in office.
David Enrich of The New York Times pointed out on Twitter that one of the gifts disclosed was a Mac Pro from Apple CEO Tim Cook with a listed valuation of $5,999.
While other business leaders have distanced themselves from Trump, Cook enjoyed a relatively cozy relationship with the president up until the attack on the Capitol earlier this month. In August 2019, Trump told Fox Business that Cook always called him directly, unlike other CEOs. Cook, when asked about his relationship with Trump, said he believed in ""direct communication.""
He used this direct communication to lobby Trump to exempt Apple from Chinese import tariffs in 2019, and the company received tariff-exemption approval on its Apple Watch and several other products, The New York Times reported.
Trump also misleadingly touted his close relationship with Apple as evidence of his manufacturing prowess. After a November 2019 tour of a Texas plant that manufactured Apple products, Trump tweeted, ""Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America.""
But the facility had produced Apple products since 2012 and was owned by a company called Flex that contracted with Apple, Insider previously reported.
In recent weeks, Cook — who held a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in 2016 — appears to have distanced himself from Trump in the wake of the attack on the Capitol. On January 6, the CEO tweeted that the day's events were ""sad and shameful.""
In the executive disclosures, the gift from Cook is recorded as a ""Mac Pro Computer, the first created at the Flex Factory in Austin Texas."" But the claim that it's the first Mac Pro manufactured at the facility seems misleading. The Verge reported the Flex factory in Texas first assembled a Mac Pro in 2013. The disclosure may be referring to the 2019 model of the Mac Pro, which was a redesigned model.
Of the 10 gifts Trump disclosed, the Mac Pro is the second most valuable. He listed a ""bronze statue depicting flag raising over Iwo Jima"" worth $25,970, given by a representative of the Greatest Generations Foundation. He also reported four gifts of golf clubs, one from Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg, and a UFC belt courtesy of Colby Covington.
More broadly, these disclosures showed Trump's businesses took a hit during the pandemic. Insider reported Thursday that despite a 13% revenue growth at Mar-a-Largo, the revenue for Trump International Hotel in Washington declined and the majority of Trump golf courses suffered losses of 10% or more from 2019 to 2020.

"How to play Jackbox games on a TV, whether you're using a gaming console, computer, or streaming device",https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/streaming/how-to-play-jackbox-on-tv,"Tue, 05 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Jackbox, a purveyor of party games, is best seen on a TV for the excitement of watching your silly drawings, clever wit, and inside jokes play out on the big screen. And whether you realize it or not, you likely already have access to one of many methods available for playing a Jackbox party pack or standalone game on a TV. 
But before you learn how to play through your TV, you'll want to confirm which games are compatible with your device. This will help you make the best decision setting up play through your big screen. To do this, just click on the game or party pack you want to purchase and scroll to the compatibility section beneath the game or pack's description. If you see your platform or device listed, you're ready to buy. 
Once you've made your purchase, ensure you also have a device like another iPad, computer, or smartphone available to log into Jackbox.TV, as that's how you'll enter your answers, make your drawings, and vote on the best of the bunch each round.
Here's how you can play Jackbox on a TV.
If you own a Nintendo Switch, Playstation 3, 4, or 5,  Xbox One, or Xbox Series S/X, these consoles all support hosting some or all of the games in the Jackbox catalog through their respective stores. Download Jackbox games to your console and, if an HDMI cable is required, connect it from your TV to your console to play — just like you would with other games.
Jackbox can also be played directly on Apple TV and iPad with the app version. To play the game on your iPad, you want to mirror it to your Apple TV using AirPlay. For iPad users with Google Home, you can also cast the game on your TV through the app's built-in mirroring tool. 
Amazon Fire TV users can simply purchase the Jackbox app from Amazon and play straight from their TV, while Android TV users can also purchase the Jackbox app in the Google Play Store and start having fun through their compatible TVs.
The Steam, Humble, and Fanatical gaming platforms all have Jackbox available to download for PC, Mac, and Linux users. Epic Games also offers Jackbox for PC and Mac devices. Once purchased, you'll be able to access the games from your purchase library. 
To play games from these platforms on your TV, you'd just need to connect your computer to your TV with an HDMI cord, use screen-mirroring tools from AirPlay on your Mac, or cast from your Mac or PC with Chromecast.

"Tim Cook takes swipe at Facebook for creating ""social catastrophe""",https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-takes-swipe-at-facebook-social-catastrophe-2021-1,"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple's privacy war with Facebook is escalating again.
CEO Tim Cook on Thursday launched an attack on business models that prioritize engagement above all and gather user data to target users with advertising.
""Technology does not need vast troves of personal data, stitched together across dozens of websites and apps, in order to succeed,"" he said in a speech to the European Computers, Privacy and Data Protection Conference. ""Advertising existed and thrived for decades without it. And we're here today because the path of least resistance is rarely the path of wisdom.""
While he did not mention Facebook by name, it appeared fairly clear he was referring to the social-media company.
""At a moment of rampant disinformation and conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms, we can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement is good engagement — the longer the better — and all with the goal of collecting as much data as possible,"" Cook said.
""It is long past time to stop pretending that this approach doesn't come with a cost — of polarization, of lost trust, and, yes, of violence. A social dilemma cannot be allowed to become a social catastrophe,"" he added. That comment seemed to allude to the Netflix documentary ""The Social Dilemma,"" which examined social-media companies that monetize users' attention. The film prompted a response from Facebook, which dismissed it as sensationalist.
The Apple CEO seemed to call on lawmakers to regulate Facebook. ""If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise,"" he said. ""It deserves reform.""
Apple and Facebook have been at loggerheads since August, when Apple announced plans to begin forcing iPhone apps to ask users for consent before tracking them for advertising purposes.
This privacy update was originally scheduled to roll out with iOS 14 in September, but Apple delayed it after Facebook protested, saying the update would decimate its and other developers' ad revenue. Apple this week said the feature would finally roll out in early spring. Insider reported in December that the company was seeking a March release date.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg attacked Apple during a Facebook earnings call Wednesday, accusing the iPhone maker of making ""misleading"" promises about its privacy practices.
News broke Thursday that Facebook was preparing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple over its App Store rules for third-party developers. This fit with comments in which Zuckerberg accused Apple of abusing its App Store dominance.

Zuckerberg told staff: 'We need to inflict pain' on Apple: WSJ report,https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-inflict-pain-apple-wsj-2021-2,"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Reports of a long-time feud between Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Apple CEO Tim Cook have resurfaced, with The Wall Street Journal reporting on angry comments apparently made by Zuckerberg in 2018. 
Per the Journal, as a row brewed over Facebook's data collection practices, Tim Cook gave an interview on national television. During the appearance, Cook claimed Apple would never have found itself in the same position as the social media company.
According to the Journal, people familiar with the matter said Zuckerberg's comments in private went far beyond his public response that Cook was being ""extremely glib."" The Facebook chief reportedly told his team that 'we need to inflict pain,' for what he considered to be the poor treatment of his company, the report said.  
The tensions between the pair became public in 2014, when Cook criticized Facebook's business model.
In the intervening years, tensions appear to have heightened. More recently, Cook took a swipe at Facebook after Mark Zuckerberg accused Apple of misleading users. That particular row centered on an iOS privacy update.
As Insider reported, Cook expressed annoyance over business models that prioritized engagement above all and gathered user data to target users with advertising. Although he didn't mention Facebook by name, it was a fairly transparent jibe at the social media network, the report stated.
The iOS update will make it far easier for users to decline to have their data tracked to enable targeted advertisements, DW reported recently. Tracking can already be switched off on Apple devices, but only if users search through their settings to disable it.
Once the update arrives, every user will be able to refuse such data tracking when setting up a device, per DW.
Facebook is trying to pre-empt the move by asking users for permission to track their data so it can target them with ads. As Insider reported, the request will take the form of a pop-up, which tells users that allowing trackers means they ""get ads that are more personalized"" and ""support business that rely on ads to reach customers.""
Facebook's position is that Apple is self-preferencing and has carved out policies that benefit it.  According to the social media giant, Apple's definition of ""tracking"" is that data has to pass through a third party to be considered tracking. It stated that by definition, that applies to every app and website and business – except Apple who owns the operating system.
According to Facebook, Apple has also extended special privileges for their own ad measurement and is misleading users about their own data practices by not sharing in their app privacy labels that they connect identifiers to account information, the same way they are making their competitors do.
Apple did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. 
In a statement to Insider, Facebook said: ""This is not about two companies – this is about the future of the free internet. Apple is creating two sets of rules – one for themselves and one for small businesses, app developers, and consumers who lose out. Apple claims this is about privacy, but it's about profit, and we're joining others to point out their self-preferencing, anti-competitive behavior.""

Apple is talking with lidar suppliers for self-driving vehicles: Bloomberg,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-is-talking-with-lidar-suppliers-for-self-driving-vehicles-bloomberg-2021-2,"Sun, 21 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple has reportedly begun talking to suppliers of lidar self-driving car sensors, as part of its effort to build an electric vehicle, according to Bloomberg. 
Common on many self-driving vehicles and prototypes, lidar sensors are used to determine the vehicle's distance from objects, people, and other vehicles. The technology also is used for other tech, including a few iPhone models. 
Apple was talking with several lidar suppliers working on next-gen hardware, according to Bloomberg. The report also said Apple has developed in-house much of the software needed for self-driving vehicles. But a vehicle launch may be at least five years away, Bloomberg reported, citing internal Apple sources. 
In recent weeks and months, reports have also claimed Apple was in talks with several car manufacturers about building Apple-branded vehicles.
In January, a South Korean newspaper reported advanced talks with Hyundai, with plans to build a ""beta"" version of an Apple vehicle within about a year. But Hyundai and its sister brand Kia later denied those talks. 
Nissan similarly last week told Insider it hadn't entered discussions with Apple, despite reports saying it had.
""However, Nissan is always open to exploring collaborations and partnerships to accelerate industry transformation,"" the spokesperson said.

Facebook's Apple Watch competitor needs to do 3 things,https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-apple-watch-competitor-privacy-wearables-2021-2,"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Over the past week, reports have surfaced that Facebook is working on a competitor to the Apple Watch. First reported by The Information on Friday, the device is expected to launch in the early part of next year. 
Facebook isn't exactly known as a hardware company, though it does have the Oculus VR headsets, which it acquired in 2014. The company also makes the Portal, a line of video calling devices, including a setup TV box. 
However, both of those are relatively niche products compared to a smartwatch. Even though Oculus is second in terms of overall VR headset market share, it's still a relatively small market. Analysts estimate Facebook sold around 800,000 Oculus headsets last year. Apple, for comparison, sold 7.6 million Apple Watches in the first quarter alone. 
Still, there's a good reason that Facebook might want to create a device of its own, and it goes to the core of the battle it's currently waging against Apple. 
Right now, Facebook is essentially at the mercy of Apple and Google, which control iOS and Android respectively and make the rules for those platforms. 
The Information's report says that a smartwatch is a part of Mark Zuckerberg's goal to control whatever computing platform comes after the smartphone. The idea is that the product would be a fitness wearable that runs on a version of Android, with Facebook seeking to eventually create its own wearable OS. 
Apple has made privacy its core brand value proposition. Facebook, while claiming that it designs its products in a privacy-protective manner, is a platform designed to track user activity, collect their personal information, and monetize it through targeted advertising.  
Those two things are hard to reconcile, and there's a reasonable question as to whether people will be in much of a hurry to hand over more of their personal information to Facebook. It's one thing to see ads for the pair of shoes or a belt you were looking at online. It's an entirely different thing to see an ad for shoes because Facebook knows you just started running because it's collecting data on your workouts. 
Or imagine that Facebook decides to use its smartwatch to identify your location. When Apple updated iOS 13 to require that apps ask permission before using your location information, Facebook was quick to protest. It told users that turning off location information would result in a worse Facebook experience. In reality, Facebook uses your location for various purposes, including showing relevant ads based on where you are geographically.
Google has also added similar location controls to Android 10. With a Facebook smartwatch, the social media network would be able to effectively bypass those controls since it wouldn't need your smartphone to provide location data. Instead, it could just feed data from the Watch into your profile and then show you ads on your smartphone or desktop computer.
There's no indication either way about Facebook's plans, but the fact that everything I just wrote seems plausible is indicative of the trust deficit the company faces. 
Oculus is actually a good example. Since Facebook announced it would require Oculus users to link their Facebook account in order to use the device, the response has been overwhelmingly negative. Most people understand that Facebook is going to collect information about what you do on Facebook or Instagram. That's not the same thing as having it scoop up your data when you're using a VR headset — or now possibly, a smartwatch.
A lot of people use Facebook, but that doesn't mean they trust Facebook. That distinction matters if the thing you're planning to sell is a constant source of highly-personal data that people wear everywhere they go. 
The Apple Watch is a premium device, which sells at a premium price, at least compared to other smartwatches. Still, it accounts for more than 51% of the entire smartwatch market and is the fastest-growing segment of Apple's business. 
Facebook, on the other hand, doesn't need its wearable device to make money. Since the company makes most of its revenue from selling targeted ads, anything that increases user engagement and expands the reach of its platform is a net positive, even if it doesn't make money on its own. Facebook's business has never been about making money off its users, but off of their data. 
If the primary goal is to break free from the constraints of accessing its users on other manufacturer's platforms, Facebook just needs to make it compelling enough that people buy one instead of an Apple Watch. That means it has more flexibility over what it charges, including pricing it at cost — or even at a loss — in order to make it a more attractive option.
Even if Facebook offers a more competitive price than Apple, there are already quite a few affordable fitness trackers and smartwatches. The Fitbit Versa 3 and Fitbit Sense are both less expensive than the Apple Watch Series 6 and have an established app ecosystem. 
Both devices allow you to respond to notifications, control your Spotify playlist, and even have Fitbit's own contactless payment app. Now that Fitbit is owned by Google, it seems reasonable to expect that its integration with Android will become even more seamless.
Still, Facebook is in a unique position here as well. First, it has almost 3 billion users. Obviously not all of them are in the market for a smartwatch, and many of those who are probably already have one. 
But there are a lot of people who aren't yet using a smartwatch. Even for Apple, which reportedly has 100 million Apple Watch users, that's still less than 10% of the 1 billion people it says are active iPhone users. 
It doesn't seem unrealistic that Facebook could leverage its user base to push the adoption of its own wearable. That effort could be helped by building out its own ecosystem. Not only does Facebook already occupy a central technology role in the lives of its users, but The Information's report says the company is working on integrating with services like Peloton Interactive.
Connecting its users with fitness services they already use could make a Facebook Watch an appealing alternative to Apple's ecosystem, which largely requires you to use its products and services. 
While it's true that Apple has expanded its support for Gymkit, which allows fitness equipment makers to integrate with the Apple Watch, uptake has been slow, to say the least. Peloton did announce its Bike+ last September, which is compatible with the Apple Watch, but that version is $600 more than the original model.
Plus, Apple now offers Fitness+, a monthly subscription service of video fitness classes that connect with the Apple Watch. That means there's little motivation for Apple to make it easy to use your Watch with other services. 
Facebook could use the leverage of its massive user base to encourage third-party services to integrate with the hope that Facebook's users could become their customers since it isn't deeply married to its own ecosystem in the same way as Apple.
If Facebook can do these three things, there's a chance it could credibly compete with Apple. At a minimum, it could prove to do what most other manufacturers haven't been able, which is to consolidate the non-Apple smartwatch market. Of course, given Facebook's track record on both hardware and privacy, we're still a long way from overcoming the impossible.

Six Apple patents that may shed light on the vehicle's key features,https://www.businessinsider.com/six-apple-patents-may-shed-light-on-vehicle-key-features-2021-1,"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple has been talking with lidar suppliers about its electric vehicle project, according to reports. 
The news that an Apple car is reportedly on the horizon may not come as a surprise to those who have paid close attention to the vehicle-related patents Apple has filed in the last few years. 
In 2017, for example, an Apple patent gave the first hint Apple would make self-driving vehicles. It was reported in January that Apple and Hyundai were planning to sign a deal to make the first ""beta"" version of an Apple car, though Hyundai has since denied that they were in talks with the tech company.
The vehicle would be just one of several big bets the company makes in the next decade, and could face stiff competition from other EVs.

Wall Street analysts said Apple would have a few key advantages, in part because of its strong brand. One big unanswered question was whether Apple would have complete control over the vehicle design, according to Morgan Stanley analysts. The company has been most successful when it controls every aspect of a product, from concept to delivery.
""This means designing the components and designing every part of the product... how it looks and feels to the consumer, the software and the ecosystem that surrounds those products,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty, according to a research note sent to clients this month. 
While patents offer insight to what final features may look like, there's no guarantee that every patented idea will make it into a final product.
Here are six recent Apple patents for vehicle features.  
An Apple vehicle might have holographic images displayed on its windshield, according to US Patent 10,866,414 B2, ""System with Holographic Head-Up Display.""
In that patent, Apple's designers described a system that would shoot holographic images onto the windshield or other windows, which would then be reflected back to the driver and passengers. Those images may include information about the vehicle – including ""speed, direction, and location"" – or information about what's happening inside, like what song is playing on the radio. 

                          
                        Touchscreens or other controls may be hidden in seats, doors, and other surfaces, according to US Patent 10,656,777 B1, ""Concealed User Interfaces."" 
That patent described ways passengers could tap, touch, or pinch their surroundings. An input device would be ""concealed behind a surface"" and, when touched, would light up.

For those who suffer from motion sickness, Apple may be working on a solution, according to US Patent 10,825,255 B2, ""Augmented Virtual Display."" 
That patent included a virtual reality system to project stabilized content for passengers who experience motion sickness. According to the patent: ""The VR system may aid in productivity, as passengers may perform work while riding in the vehicle without experiencing motion sickness.""
Apple designers may be working on controls for privacy glass and tinted windows, according to US Patent 10,843,535 B1, ""System and Method for Dynamic Privacy and Window Tinting."" 
That patent described a way to ""intelligently tint"" windows. 
Apple vehicles may include new ways to send alerts to drivers, according to US Patent 10,878,699 B2, ""Wireless Vehicle System for Enhancing Situational Awareness."" 
According to the patent: ""Alerts may be presented to a driver of a vehicle and other suitable actions may be taken based on the locations of nearby vehicles, vehicle type information, and other information regarding traffic in the vicinity of the driver.""
The patent's illustrations included possible alerts that could be sent to the driver, including ""Ambulance Passing Pull Over Now"" and ""Alert Car Passing On Right.""

Apple vehicles may include new climate controls, according to US Patent 10,875,380 B2, ""Climate Control."" 
That patent detailed a way to determine the ""optimal comfort conditions"" for a wide range of situations.
It would include ""various vehicle components to control climate conditions, including window assemblies, sunroof assemblies, etc."" It would determine the climate based on ""perceived temperature of various occupant body parts,"" according to the patent.

Apple will replace the batteries that won't hold a charge in certain MacBook Pros for free,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-will-replace-macbook-pro-batteries-2016-2017-for-free-2021-2,"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple will replace batteries in MacBook Pro models from 2016 and 2017 that won't hold a charge.
Some customers have reported that their laptops haven't been able to hold a charge beyond 1%. Apple said only ""a very small number of customers"" are affected by this issue. 
You can view your computer's model by clicking the Apple menu icon on the upper-left corner of your screen and selecting ""About This Mac.""
Apple said ""the battery health status on these devices will also indicate Service Recommended. If the status indicates that your battery is Normal, your battery is not affected by this issue."" 
Read more: Apple reportedly ditching its most controversial feature in the next version of the MacBook Pro shows the company's finally listening to its customers
If your MacBook Pro is affected, you can request a free replacement through Apple. 
Apple is also asking 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pro computer owners to update their computers to macOS Big Sur 11.2.1 or install the macOS Catalina 10.15.7 update to prevent this issue from happening to other computers from those two years. 
This is not the company's first time issuing replacements for batteries in its products. 
In 2017, Apple customers claimed that their iPhones' performance slowed down after installing Apple software updates, and data at the time suggested that replacing the battery could speed up performance. Customers said this led them to believe that their phones would need to be replaced or given a new battery. While Apple admitted to slowing down older iPhone models, it said it was doing so to prevent the devices from turning off, not to force customers to buy new phones. The company has denied any wrongdoing in the incident, dubbed ""batterygate.""
Following a class-action lawsuit filed by customers affected by the problem Apple agreed to pay a $500 million settlement, or about $25 for each iPhone affected.

"Big Tech in Healthcare: Amazon, Apple, Google & Microsoft",https://www.businessinsider.com/2-14-2021-big-tech-in-healthcare-report,"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Healthcare organizations have to contend with the coronavirus pandemic and its lingering impacts, and shifting consumer demands for fast and convenient services. Healthcare players are being forced to move on their digital transformation efforts, and Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft are lending their tech-savviness to become partners for the job.
The Big Four tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft — are accelerating their pursuit of the healthcare market, and they're starting to hone their strategies in on specific corners of the ecosystem. Below, we break down how these players are ramping up their efforts to reshape healthcare by developing and collaborating on new tools that could be a boon to consumers, medical professionals, and insurers.
Amazon has been aggressively infiltrating as many healthcare sectors as possible over the last few years. It's relying on its cloud arm Amazon Web Services (AWS) and voice tech expertise to get through hospital doors, and it's using acquisitions and large-scale partnerships to launch new healthcare projects.
Amazon is setting up initiatives to transform pharmacy, the medical supply chain, health insurance, and care delivery. Amazon is leveraging its delivery power to carve into the medical supplies distribution space and using its massive employee base to test the telehealth waters.
Some of the top healthcare solutions and platforms offer by Amazon include:
Apple is eager to build out its health division and live out CEO Tim Cook's goal of having health be Apple's 'greatest contribution to mankind.' Apple is striving to turn its consumer products into portable patient health hubs and valuable clinical research tools.
Each iteration of the Apple Watch has been beefed up with new health features, and it's leaning on the iPhone's Health Records feature to link with provider organizations looking for ways to better communicate with patients' many points of care. 
Apple is using its popular consumer-facing products, like the Apple Watch and iPhone, to forge partnerships with payers, health systems, and clinical researchers. Apple has been boosting the number of health-related features accessible on its Watch to establish the wearable as a clinical tool to be used in medical research. 
Some of the top healthcare solutions and platforms offer by Apple include:
Alphabet is focusing on its expertise in AI and data storage to help drive the industry-wide push for predictive analytics, precision medicine, and interoperability. Alphabet hopes to enhance consumer health and clamp down on healthcare costs.
Further, Alphabet announced its acquisition of wearable giant Fitbit for $2 billion in November 2019 — opening up a world of new possibilities for the tech titan when it comes to health-tracking and employee benefits. 
Alphabet is using its dominance in data storage and analytics to patch up interoperability challenges and streamline clinical research. The company is leaning on its cloud platform artificial intelligence (AI) to land strategic hospital partnerships by solving issues with electronic health record (EHR) interoperability and limited computing infrastructure. 
Some of the top healthcare solutions and platforms offer by Google include:
Microsoft is facing off against Alphabet and Amazon in the race to control the healthcare cloud market. Microsoft is largely staying out of the consumer-facing realm with its health play—zeroing in on Azure, and enabling providers and payers to target specific pockets of populations for better health outcomes and helping to optimize data storage. 
                          
                        
Microsoft's health play hinges on its cloud platform, Azure, and the data analytics prowess it can provide healthcare firms. These efforts stem mainly from its Healthcare NExT program, which aids in providing the company with a focused brand as it explores how its tech can be used within the healthcare setting.
Some of the top healthcare solutions and platforms offer by Microsoft include:
Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft have been dipping their toes into the healthcare industry, and some of their endeavors have the potential to change healthcare at large.
As the Big Four move steadily onward into healthcare, it's necessary for legacy players (hospitals, insurers, pharma companies, health IT firms) to know exactly what their strategies look like, and what they stand to lose and gain.
Here are some key takeaways from the report:

"How much is the iPhone X? How to buy refurbished or used iPhone X models, starting at $639 from Apple",https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-much-is-the-iphone-x,"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"With the release of newer iPhones like the iPhone 11 and iPhone 12, Apple has phased out sales of the iPhone X, which was originally released in 2017. 
But, if you're in the market for an iPhone and don't want to drop major dollars on the newest versions, you can still purchase a refurbished or used iPhone X, XR, XS, or XS Max from Apple or other retailers like Amazon and Best Buy.
Here's everything you need to know about the iPhone X models, and how much they cost.
The iPhone X — like the XR, XS, and XS Max — is no longer sold in new condition by any retailer. But, you can buy it certified refurbished from Apple, which is the safest bet to guarantee the best condition. 
However, if you prefer a cheaper option, the iPhone X is available refurbished or used from third-party sites. 
Important: If you're buying directly from Apple, all models are fully unlocked, meaning they will work with any cellular carrier. On Amazon and Best Buy, you'll be able to buy the phones unlocked from any carrier, or from a specific carrier if you choose. Some other retailers may require you to register the device with your cell phone carrier. All prices listed below are for the unlocked versions.
You can buy the iPhone X 256GB for $679 from Apple. You can also find iPhone X models will less storage starting at $299 on Amazon and $429 on Best Buy. 

You can't buy the iPhone XR from Apple, but you can find it on Amazon starting at $325 and on Best Buy starting at $409. 
 
You can buy the iPhone XS starting at $639 from Apple, starting at $328 on Amazon, and for $530 from Best Buy. 

You can find the iPhone XS Max starting at $719 from Apple and starting at $445 on Amazon. 

Here's what each iPhone X model offers: 
The iPhone X kicked off the iPhone redesign. It introduced the edge-to-edge display with almost no visible bezel, packing a 5.8-inch display with dual 12-megapixel cameras (both wide-angle and telephoto).
It also replaced Touch ID with Face ID, creating the infamous notch — the screen is interrupted at the top with a cutout for various cameras and sensors.

The 'Apple Car' is actually being made by Henrik Fisker and Foxconn — and Apple has nothing to do with it,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-car-is-actually-being-made-by-fisker-and-foxconn-2021-2,"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Even though the much-discussed Apple Car has staged something of a comeback in recent months, ""Project Titan,"" as the undertaking has been code-named, remains the unimpressive concatenation of rumors it has always been.
Meanwhile, one of Apple's most important manufacturing partners for its actual products, Taiwan's Foxconn, just announced a plan to develop an all-new electric vehicle with Fisker, Inc., a startup founded by serial automotive entrepreneur Henrik Fisker.
 
Foxconn has been making noise in the auto industry since early 2020, when it announced a technology platform for vehicles. In 2021, it started joining Chinese carmakers — including Geely, owner of the Volvo brands — to collaborate on actual cars.
The Fisker assignment has its own codename: ""Project PEAR,"" for ""Personal Electric Automotive Revolution,"" the company revealed in a statement. The vehicle should arrive in 2023, following the launch of Fisker's first effort, the Ocean SUV, slated for a late 2022 launch.
""We created our company to disrupt every convention in the auto industry,"" Fisker said. ""The creation of Project PEAR with Foxconn brings together two like-minded and complementary companies, each focused on creating new value in a traditional industry.""
Fisker Inc. shares shot up more than 15% on the news, to about $19. The carmaker staged an IPO last October, on the heels of being acquired by a blank-check fund established by private-equity giant Apollo Global Management. The deal was an early arrival to a craze for ""special purpose acquisition companies,"" or SPACs, that gained momentum last year. 
The company raised about $1 billion and initially saw a spike in its shares, but in recent months the stock had been trading down slightly.
Fisker, one of the car world's best-known designers prior to taking the entrepreneurship plunge, released a teaser sketch of the vehicle, which the companies said could be brought to production in about 24 months, double-time in an industry that usually requires almost half a decade to create a new car from scratch.
The proposed deal follows what Fisker has described in several interviews with Insider as an ""asset-light"" business model. While other EV startups, such as Rivian and Nikola, have committed to building their own factories or buying unused ones from established automakers, Fisker has already seen that movie.
His previous company, Fisker Automotive, bought a shuttered GM factory in Delaware, but the company went bankrupt in 2013 before it was able to generate any production. With Fisker, Inc., the game plan has been to design vehicles and organize a business approach, but to outsource manufacturing to partners. The Ocean is being produced in Austria by Magna Steyr, the manufacturing arm of Canada's Magna International, and Magna is taking a 6% equity stake in Fisker. 
According to Foxconn chairman Young-way Liu, the Chinese company will contribute the electric motor, electric control module, and battery components. 
""We have two major advantages in this regard, with an exceptional vertically integrated global supply chain and the best supply chain management team in our industry,"" he said in a statement.
It's important to note that Fisker now has two of the world's best-known manufacturers partnering to bring a pair of electric vehicles to market — in North America, Europe, and Asia — before 2025 while Apple has yet to announce a collaboration with anyone.
That doesn't rule out Apple working with Foxconn, as well; in fact, the deal with Fisker could presage a much more aggressive move by the Taiwanese company, officially known as Hon Hai Technology Group, into automotive, with Apple as a customer. 
But at this point, Project Titan is doing anything but living up to its name. And Apple, if it's serious about moving into transportation, is falling further behind every year. Tesla dominates the still-small yet rapidly growing EV space, Alphabet's Waymo and GM's Cruise have pulled away from the self-driving pack, and the traditional car companies are now making huge investments in an electric transition. Together, Ford and GM are spending almost $60 billion over the next decade.
Fisker has demonstrated that new entrants can go from the drawing board to vehicle-pre-production in less than a year, and the SPAC process, although controversial, can generate the billions in funding that startup automakers need to get actual vehicles on the road.
I've argued that Apple should sell Project Titan and unload the investment burden before it costs Cupertino more than it's worth. But the Fisker-Foxconn announcement raises another prospect: Apple could conjoin Titan with Fisker and Foxconn, using some of its almost-$200-billion cash hoard to invest in Fisker, and use the vehicle platform as a showcase for what Apple does best — user interfaces.
Designed by Fisker. Built by Foxconn. With Apple inside. Now that would be a car! A truly titanic project, indeed.

"Buffett, Berkshire should cut Apple, lift buybacks, acquire: 7 experts",https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-apple-stock-buybacks-acquisitions-7-experts-2021-2,"Wed, 03 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway had a rollercoaster ride of a year in 2020.
The famous investor's company owns scores of businesses including Geico, See's Candies, and the BNSF railway, as well as billion-dollar stakes in Apple, Bank of America, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, and other public companies.
As a result, Berkshire was hit hard when the COVID-19 pandemic spurred authorities to impose lockdowns, shutter non-essential businesses, and roll out travel restrictions last spring.
Buffett initially took cover, selling Berkshire's stakes in the ""big four"" US airlines and slashing its positions in JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and other financial stocks in the second quarter of last year. The approach surprised many commentators who had expected the investor to deploy a chunk of Berkshire's roughly $130 billion cash pile when markets tanked.
However, the Treasury and Federal Reserve moved quickly to pump liquidity into the economy and shore up asset prices, giving Buffett little time to find bargains, or strike the kinds of lucrative deals he made during the financial crisis.
Buffett and his team sprung back into action in the third quarter, when they were confident the pandemic didn't pose an existential threat to Berkshire. They announced more than $35 billion of investments in the period, including $18 billion in stock purchases, a record $9 billion in share buybacks, and $10 billion worth of deals.
Berkshire will reveal how its operations fared in the fourth quarter, as well as which stocks it bought and sold, later this month. We asked seven experts to share what they're hoping and expecting to see from Buffett, his business partner Charlie Munger, and the rest of the team this year.
Several of them called for Berkshire to cash out some of its Apple stock, boost its share buybacks, and make acquisitions at the right price. Here are their thoughts, lightly edited and condensed for clarity:
Bill Smead, founder and investment chief of Smead Capital Management:
""We expect Buffett and Munger to sit on their hands and wait patiently for this financial euphoria episode to end. When euphoria breaks, it will punish stock prices. Buffett can then pick and choose among meritorious bargains.
We expect 60% declines for popular growth stocks, 80% declines for glam revenue growth stories, and total annihilation of concept stocks!""
Paul Lountzis, founder and president of Lountzis Asset Management:
""We would like Buffett to maintain his discipline through these unique times, as he always has. We would also like him to sell 20% to 25% of his Apple holdings, buy back a minimum of $10 billion to $20 billion of Berkshire shares depending on their price, and pay a special dividend of $10 billion to $20 billion.
Apple is a great company, but may not be an attractive stock given current valuation levels. The sale of Apple shares would provide a great deal of money to be used for buybacks and the special dividend. Berkshire would still have an enormous amount of cash, but that is fine with us. We are extremely patient with very long time horizons.
I do not recommend Berkshire make any additional technology investments as many are selling for 40 to 100 times revenues and will never grow into their valuations.""
Darren Pollock, portfolio manager at Cheviot Value Management:
""We would not be averse to Buffett and his team reducing Berkshire's stake in Apple. The shares ended the year at more than 30 times next year's earnings, a valuation that is more than 2.5 times higher than its average during the prior decade.
Apple is a great business, just very highly priced at this time. We know Buffett regretted not selling at least a portion of Berkshire's giant stake in Coca-Cola in 1998, and today the Apple position is much larger. We'd like to see large, continued share buybacks as long as Berkshire stock remains attractively priced. We think Berkshire can easily buy $20 billion worth of its own shares annually and still add to its cash balance each year. Moreover, large buybacks should not hinder its ability to make acquisitions. This is a company in such strong financial condition that it can have its cake and eat it, too. As Munger likes to say, to be a great investor one needs a combination of great patience and then great gumption to act aggressively when opportunities arise. Over time, Berkshire management has consistently shown both – though more patience than gumption in recent years. We hope to see more gumption, although only when the opportunity makes sense.""
Adam Mead, founder and CEO of Mead Capital Management, and author of ""The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway"":
""I expect to see the same broad playbook that's brought Berkshire to this point, which is patient opportunism. Berkshire has no master plan, or strategic plan, which is intentional.
I'm confident Buffett and his team will continually weigh all opportunity costs and make the right decisions as they arise. That could mean additional marketable securities if markets are favorable, purchases of whole businesses, or additional share repurchases.""
James Shanahan, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones:
""Many of Berkshire's businesses struggled in 2020. For example, BNSF was challenged by lower shipping volumes. NetJets, Flight Safety, and Precision Castparts were impacted by reduced demand for aviation services. And the insurance segment experienced elevated life and business-interruption claims, as well as lower premiums for workers' compensation and commercial auto insurance.
Berkshire is well-positioned to benefit from a broad-based economic recovery in 2021. We are also hopeful that we observe continued cash deployment throughout 2021, at least to keep total cash at or below the $140 billion-to-$145 billion level.
Buffett was also building a large position in a public company in the third quarter, and wanted to complete the purchases prior to making its identity public. As a result, it would seem likely that Buffett purchased more of the stock in late October and beyond.""
Tyler Hardt, portfolio manager at Pelican Bay Capital Management:
""My greatest hope this year is that Buffett is able to put his substantial cash pile to work. His swelling checkbook of $140 billion means there are very few major companies that are off limits.
Theoretically, between the cash on hand and value of Apple stock, Berkshire could buy a major company like Exxon without issuing a penny of debt. The very thought of that possibility would be mind-boggling just a year or two ago.
I would also like to see Buffett and his team consider trimming their holdings in Apple, which has become Berkshire's single largest position, with a recent market value of $137 billion.
I applaud Buffett for his acumen to buy Apple shares and the confidence to make it a significant investment. However, Apple is now boasting a price-to-earnings multiple of 44. This seems exuberant, particularly in light of other uses of that capital, such as buying more shares of Berkshire itself.""
Brian Gongol, veteran shareholder and long-time follower:
""The signs point to a consolidation of Berkshire's banking investments. I don't think Buffett has lost his taste for banks, but it's clear he's lost his patience with certain bankers. Further consolidation in banking is inevitable, and Berkshire may be in a position to get in before the mergers start taking stupid turns. In other words: I don't think Buffett is done investing in Bank of America.
The Biden administration may pose less political risk to markets, but the more the government spends and borrows, the greater the urgency in putting the Berkshire cash mountain to work. If inflation starts to rear its ugly head, then suddenly a lot of cash-deployment opportunities that looked only OK before start to look more attractive.
Sentimentally, I'd love to see Berkshire pull off another transformative acquisition like the BNSF purchase. It's fun — like watching your team make a playoff run. But in light of the market conditions right now, I doubt there are any such opportunities hidden in plain sight.
I would be very satisfied if Berkshire took this year's earnings and used them to buy more of the things it already loves, starting with share repurchases. It's not the mouth-watering deal at $230 a share that it was at $180, but it's still far from overpriced.
If the company bought another 5% of Kraft Heinz, or inched up its holdings in the Japanese trading houses from 5% to 7.5% or so, or tacked on another couple of regional utilities, that would be a thoroughly satisfactory way of staying the course without holding still.""

"Investor Ryan Cohen Shares Warren Buffett Lessons, Explains Apple Bet",https://www.businessinsider.com/chewy-ryan-cohen-warren-buffett-lessons-apple-investment-2020-10,"Tue, 02 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Ryan Cohen ignored the naysayers when he cofounded an online pet-supplies retailer in 2011 and squared off against Amazon and Pets.com.
He ultimately sold the company for $3.4 billion in 2017, and stepped down as CEO the following year to spend more time with his family and pursue personal goals.
Cohen broke with convention again by investing the vast majority of his wealth in two stocks, Apple and Wells Fargo. He later placed a contrarian bet on GameStop and secured three seats on the video-game retailer's board in January, laying the groundwork for an astronomical rally in its stock price.
The entrepreneur attributes his independent streak to the ""two biggest influences on my professional life"": his father, Ted Cohen, who passed away in December 2019, and Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and Berkshire Hathaway CEO.
""Something critical that I learned from my dad and Warren Buffett was the ability to separate myself from the herd and think independently,"" Cohen told Insider in an October interview.
The pair's teachings allow him to ""block out the noise, develop my own point of view, and not be influenced by daily headlines or the consensus or what's in style.""
For example, many people initially doubted Chewy would be able to ship 30-pound bags of pet food to customers and make any money.
""In the early years, few investors thought Chewy was a good idea,"" Cohen said. ""I struck out raising capital over 100 times.""
Ignoring the skeptics, as well as avoiding distractions and saying ""no"" to all but the best opportunities, enabled Cohen to focus on the things most critical to Chewy's success: competitive prices, compelling products, fast shipping, and personalized customer service.
The former Chewy chief credited his dad, who ran a glassware-importing business, with giving him the courage of his convictions.
Cohen's father taught him to trust his instincts, treated him like an adult from an early age, solicited and listened to his opinions, and demonstrated what it meant to deeply understand a business.
""I learned how to build my company by watching him build his,"" Cohen said.
After selling Chewy, Cohen plowed the bulk of his windfall into Apple and Wells Fargo, flouting traditional investment advice about the need for a diversified portfolio.
Cohen felt comfortable with his decision partly because he bought his first Apple share at age 15, making it one of the first stocks he ever owned. The technology titan's ecosystem of hardware, software, and services — which makes it a headache for users to switch to rival products — was a key attraction, he said.
Apple's offerings have become even more integral to people's lives during the pandemic, Cohen argued. People increasingly rely on their iPhones, iPads, MacBooks, and apps to keep in touch with friends and family, work from home, conduct daily tasks such as shopping and banking, and entertain themselves.
""The strongest business in the world,"" Cohen proclaimed, echoing Buffett's comment in February 2020 that Apple is ""probably the best business I know.""
Cohen also brushed off concerns about Apple's valuation, arguing that it's relatively cheap when rock-bottom interest rates mean bonds are yielding close to zero.
Cohen declined to comment on his Wells Fargo and GameStop investments.
Cohen's emphasis on focus, independent thought, and investing with conviction aren't the only strategies he shares with Buffett.
The Chewy cofounder cited 'disciplined capital allocation,"" or spending money strategically and responsibly, as a key driver of his company's success. Buffett specializes in taking the cash flowing into Berkshire from its scores of subsidiaries, and redeploying it where it's needed most.
Cohen focused on selling pet food at Chewy, because he recognized that customers would slash every expense they could before cutting back on feeding their pets, resulting in a ""sticky"" customer base.
Consumables offered slimmer profit margins than toys or accessories, but the lifetime value of their buyers relative to the cost of acquiring them meant they generated higher returns in the long haul, he added.
Buffett famously favors companies that sell essential or staple products and services to a dedicated customer base. For example, Berkshire counts American Express, Visa, Mastercard, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Kraft Heinz among the roughly 45 stocks in its portfolio.
Cohen and Buffett also have investments in common. Apple is by far the most valuable holding in Berkshire's portfolio, and the conglomerate owned $3 billion worth of Wells Fargo stock at the last count.
Finally, Cohen practices Buffett's advice to ""be greedy when others are fearful.""
""Value doesn't move but stock prices do, creating an opportunity if you have the right temperament to buy stuff on sale,"" he said.

UK Regulator Opens Probe Into Apple's App Store 30% Commission,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-app-store-commission-developer-tax-uk-regulator-cma-investigation-2021-3,"Thu, 04 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Britain's competition regulator said on Thursday it has opened an investigation into Apple after complaints that the iPhone maker's terms and conditions for app developers are unfair and anti-competitive.
The probe will consider if Apple has a dominant position in the distribution of apps on its devices in the UK, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said.
Payment policies related to Apple's App Store have for long drawn complaints from app developers. It charges a commission of up to 30% from developers on the value of transactions or any time a consumer buys their app.
The iPhone maker said it will work with the regulator.
""The App Store has been an engine of success for app developers, in part because of the rigorous standards we have in place — applied fairly and equally to all developers — to protect customers from malware and to prevent rampant data collection without their consent,"" Apple said in a statement.
The company is also being investigated on similar grounds by the Dutch competition authorities, who are nearing a draft decision, Reuters reported last month.
Last year, the European Commission too had opened a probe into the iPhone maker over the App Store commission fee.
""Complaints that Apple is using its market position to set terms which are unfair or may restrict competition and choice – potentially causing customers to lose out when buying and using apps – warrant careful scrutiny,"" CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli said.

"How to use apple cider vinegar to help you lose weight, according to dietitians",https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss,"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The wellness trend of drinking apple cider vinegar — or fermented apple juice — has recently gained popularity due to claims it aids in weight loss, among many other benefits. While some small studies indicate apple cider vinegar may help with weight loss, more research is needed to determine its long-term effects and overall health benefits. 
Here's what the research says about apple cider vinegar and weight loss, and what you need to know before trying it. 
Yes, apple cider vinegar may help with weight loss according to some small studies, but it most likely will not help you shed substantial pounds, says Daniela Novotny, RD, a senior instructor of biomedical sciences at Missouri State University. 
Studies on the effects of apple cider vinegar so far are small and more research is needed to draw definitive conclusions about its effects, says Melissa Mitri, a registered dietitian with her own private practice. Here is what the research says: 
Other studies have shown that vinegar may also increase satiety, resulting in fewer calories consumed and, therefore, aid weight loss. 
Medical term: Satiety is the feeling of fullness after eating. Increasing satiety means you are less likely to overeat, which causes you to consume fewer calories.
Therefore, apple cider vinegar may have a modest effect on weight loss, but studies so far on the topic are limited, and more substantial research is needed, Mitri says. 
For the most part, apple cider vinegar is safe to consume, Novotny says. But, due to its high acidity, there are some potential side effects, like:
When consumed in moderation, apple cider vinegar doesn't appear to pose any significant health risks, Novotny says. If you do decide to try apple cider vinegar for weight loss, here are some safe ways to consume it:
General advice: For weight loss, Mitri recommends consuming apple cider vinegar in the morning or right before a meal as there is some evidence it may help with satiety. 
Since the research hasn't definitively proven apple cider vinegar helps with weight loss for all, there isn't good data to suggest how long you may need to take it to see results. The limited human studies suggest apple cider vinegar may help promote weight loss in obese people over a three-month period, but larger studies are needed in order to make recommendations, Mitri says. 
Important: When incorporated as part of a well-rounded diet, apple cider vinegar may help you lose weight. However, developing an individualized weight loss plan focused on nutrition and exercise with your doctor or a registered dietitian is likely to be more effective, Novotny says. 
Some small studies have indicated apple cider vinegar may help with weight loss, but more research is needed. Even so, it most likely will not help you shed substantial pounds, and it's best to create a comprehensive weight loss plan with a doctor or registered dietitian.
If you decide to try apple cider vinegar, dilute it in water or use it to make your own salad dressing. If you decide to consume apple cider vinegar stick to about one to two tablespoons a day.

How Apple can crack down on fake apps in the iOS App Store,https://www.businessinsider.com/how-apple-crack-down-fake-apps-scams-ios-app-store-2021-3,"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The open secret of the iOS App Store is that it's rife with scams. And it's not hard to see them if you look for more than a few minutes. 
Last month, a developer posted a thread on Twitter outlining how fake apps are scamming customers through a combination of fake reviews, ""free"" apps that require you to start a trial before you can use the app, and weekly subscriptions. That developer has since filed a lawsuit against Apple, alleging the company allows these scams ""to make billions of dollars in profits at the expense of small application developers and consumers.""
This highlights the dilemma facing Apple, which became the most valuable company in large part because of the iPhone and the $500 billion ecosystem of apps that surrounds it. It also draws attention to the control Apple exerts over the App Store at a time when it's already under intense scrutiny for that very thing.
Apple's argument is that its guidelines and policies are designed to protect consumers. I'm inclined to believe that Apple means that, but the problem is that its actions don't back that up. 
The iOS App Store developer guidelines say: ""We work hard to make the App Store a trustworthy ecosystem and expect our app developers to follow suit; if you're dishonest, we don't want to do business with you.""
But Apple does business with plenty of dishonest developers that make these apps.
I certainly don't think Apple endorses any of these scam apps, at least not directly. But by not taking a tougher stance, it's hurting both consumers and legitimate developers who are working hard to build apps that add value to users' lives.
An even bigger problem is that fixing this means cracking down on an extremely lucrative business for Apple. The App Store brings in an estimated $64 billion a year for Apple, and that number is growing.
Apple takes 30% of in-app purchases and either 15 or 30% of subscription fees. A lot of that is for games, which make up an estimated 66% of total revenue on iOS — games, of course, aren't necessarily scams, though they do have their own problems.
CEO Tim Cook has made no secret of the fact that Apple's services division is an important focus for the company, and the App Store is a big contributor to the bottom line.
It's hard to know exactly what percentage of the App Store revenue comes from scams (Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment). But in some ways, it doesn't matter — it seems pretty clear that Apple's values and interests are in conflict.
Scams hurt the trust consumers place in the platform, and Apple is hurting the legitimate developers that have helped make the App Store so valuable.
Many of the worst offenders simply rip off the name or identity of whatever app happens to be No. 1 on the charts to mislead users into downloading theirs instead. There are ways that Apple could fix the problem with a little transparency and a few changes.
One of the ways apps take advantage of users is by offering a weekly, instead of a monthly, subscription. Since most people are used to signing up for something on a monthly basis, it isn't always obvious that the $10 you just agreed to pay is going to be charged every week. It doesn't help that the confirmation screen when you make an in-app purchase isn't exactly clear or make this obvious.
Apple could definitely make that confirmation more clear about what you're agreeing to pay, but one of the most obvious ways to cut down on the number of apps that are taking advantage of users is to eliminate weekly subscriptions altogether. 
Presumably, the ability to bill customers on a weekly basis exists for things like newspaper subscriptions, but that doesn't seem necessary, considering it isn't how people are really used to buying apps. Plus, there's really no benefit to charging users this way that isn't outweighed by the potential for confusion and poor experience.
Apple has started sending a notice to apps that appear to be charging exorbitant subscription fees, but that, in and of itself, is problematic. In an email that was reviewed by 9to5Mac, Apple told a developer whose app had been rejected: ""Unfortunately, the prices you've selected for your app or in-app purchase products in your app do not reflect the value of the features and content offered to the user. Charging irrationally high prices for content or services with limited value is a rip-off to customers and is not appropriate for the App Store.""
That Apple can tell you that it doesn't think your app justifies whatever you've decided to charge shows how much control it has over developers. 
But I don't think Apple should be deciding if your subscription fee is justified — users should. Apple's role should be to make sure that it's clear to users what they can expect to pay and make sure that apps aren't using shady practices to trick users into something they weren't expecting. 
Another problem is when an app will simply have a welcome screen that requires you to start a subscription to use the app. In most cases, those subscriptions will offer a week or 14-day free trial to still qualify as ""free,"" but that's not really what a user expects when they download a free app.
For example, as pointed out by Kosta Eleftheriou, the developer suing Apple, a simple search for ""Roku TV remote control"" returns a free third-party app called Roku Remote Control - Roki. But when you launch the app, you can't do anything before you're met with a page to sign up. There are no other options to use the ""free"" app other than signing up for a three-day free trial, after which you'll be charged $5 a week. Never mind there's already a Roku official remote app that's actually free.
There should be some degree of usability and functionality included at no cost, and a user can decide whether they want to pay for more. Forcing them to sign up first, even for a ""trial,"" is a terrible experience and designed only to take advantage of users.
As I mentioned before, another problem is copycat apps. When an app becomes popular, less-scrupulous developers release apps that often infringe on the original app's name or icon.
For example, that's exactly what happened when Widgetsmith became the No. 1 app in the US after it went viral on TikTok. A search, at the time, for Widgetsmith revealed a top result that was a complete copy.
It doesn't seem like it would be complicated for Apple to implement a system where apps have to have unique names that aren't in use by other apps. Especially if a developer has trademarked a name, no other developer should be allowed to use that to promote their own app, and certainly not in the name itself.
It's one thing to want to advertise your ad as an alternative to something that people are highly interested in, but that's not the same as attempting to blatantly mislead consumers.
The developer guidelines tell developers that ""your app's functionality should be clear to end users and App Review,"" but just because you describe something that's factually accurate doesn't mean it will meet a user's expectations. 
For example, if you designed a weather app that ""shows current conditions,"" a user might expect that it would display the current weather for their location. But what if it showed the weather for only one location, predetermined by the app unless you pay a subscription fee? 
Technically, that would still fit the app's description, but it wouldn't in any way fit a user's expectations.
Or how about an app that says it will ""clean up the storage on your iPhone""? For example, Boost Cleaner says it will clean up the storage on your iPhone with ""one tap."" Really, once you tap that, it asks you to subscribe. Even if you do it, it just lets you review your photos, videos, or contacts to delete, something you can already do on your own. 
The app provides no new functionality. Of course, it also wants to charge you $4 a week. 
Ultimately, Apple has to decide whether it will come down on the side of protecting users or protecting the bottom line. I'm pretty confident Apple will say it always stands on the side of the former, and generally speaking, that would be good for the latter in the long run anyway. Now it's time for its actions to agree.

What devices work with Apple Fitness Plus? Here's what's compatible with Apple's workout app,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/what-devices-work-with-apple-fitness-plus,"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple Fitness Plus, Apple's subscription exercise program, integrates pre-recorded workouts in a wide range of categories with your Apple Watch and iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV. Apple Fitness Plus costs $9.99 per month or $79.99 per year, and there is an option for a free trial when you sign up.
The app allows you to choose workouts like high-intensity interval training (HIIT), yoga, strength, treadmill, cycling, rowing, and more. Here's how to make sure you have everything you need to get started with Apple Fitness Plus.
You need an Apple Watch Series 3 or later, plus an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV to follow Fitness Plus exercises. Any of these devices must be running OS version 14.3 or higher.
An Apple Watch Series 3 or newer is required for every Fitness Plus user. Aside from that, however, you can use a variety of devices:
These are the compatible iPhone models: 
These are the compatible iPad models:
You can also use an Apple TV HD or an Apple TV 4K.
Additionally, when iOS 14.5 is released, Apple Fitness Plus will become compatible with AirPlay 2. This means that you'll be able to stream the Fitness app from your iPhone or iPad to an AirPlay 2-compatible device like a TV, set-top box, or streaming media player (such as Roku). 
Apple Fitness Plus offers a lot of workout options, many of which don't require any equipment other than your body. Some workouts have unique equipment requirements, though.
The good news is that you can use any generic equipment to do the workout — Fitness Plus doesn't require you to have a particular brand or model of workout equipment. You can also do these workouts at home or at a gym.
Each workout indicates what equipment you need at the top of the screen, under the introductory image. If there's no equipment listed, you won't need any gear (except, of course, for the obvious treadmill if you've chosen a treadmill workout, for example).
However, if you want to explore a wide range of Fitness Plus exercises, you may want access to at least some of this equipment.
You'll be able to see exactly what you'll need for each workout before you start.

How to use Apple Cash to send or request money through a text message on your iPhone or iPad,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-use-apple-cash,"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"With apps like Venmo and Cash App becoming more and more commonplace these days, other companies are trying to get in on the action by creating their own peer-to-peer money transfer apps.
One of these companies is Apple. Apple Cash — which is different from Apple Pay, the virtual wallet that stores your credit cards on your phone to use in stores — is Apple's money transfer service.
Like other apps, Apple Cash lets you send money to your friends quickly and easily. The only catch is that your friends also need to have a compatible Apple device, and need to link it to their bank account.
If you're interested in signing up and trying Apple Cash for yourself, here's what you need to know.
In order to use Apple Cash, you need to be over the age of 18, and have:
Quick tip: Apple Cash is also available in a limited form on any Apple Watch with watchOS 4.2 or later, and any Mac with Touch ID.
You'll also have to add an eligible debit card from a participating bank or credit union to your Apple Wallet.
Before you're able to set up Apple Cash, you'll also need to enable two-factor authentication for your Apple ID. And of course, you have to be signed into iCloud on any device you want to send or receive money on. 
Once you've added a debit card and got Apple Pay ready, you can turn on Apple Cash in your iPhone or iPad's Settings app.
Under ""Payment Cards,"" tap ""Apple Cash"" or ""Apple Pay Cash"" and follow the instructions on the screen to set up your Apple Cash Card. Any time you send or receive money, it'll automatically be loaded to this virtual card. 
You can transfer the money on the card to your bank at any time — you'll only be charged a fee if you need to transfer funds instantly. This fee is 1% of the funds you transfer.

To use your Apple Cash card to send payments to others, it first has to have money on it. There are two ways to make this happen: Add the money yourself, or receive money from someone else using Apple Cash.
1. Open the Wallet app and tap your new Apple Cash card.
2. Tap the three dots in the top-right corner to bring up the menu.
3. To add money to your Apple Cash card, tap the ""Add Money"" button right underneath the name of the card.
4. Type in how much you want to add, then tap ""Add"" in the top-right corner. The minimum amount you can add is $10.
To transfer money off of your card and back into your bank account or onto your debit card, follow these same steps — just tap the ""Transfer to Bank"" button instead of the ""Add Money"" button.
Once you've added money, you can send it. Unlike Venmo or Cash App, Apple Cash doesn't have its own app — instead, you go through the messages app.
1. Start or open a conversation with the person you want to send money to or request from. Remember that they need to have a compatible Apple ID and device too. 
2. Tap the apps button to the left of the text box to bring up a list of apps you can use in Messages.
3. Tap the Apple Pay button.
4. Enter the amount you want to send or request, either using the directional arrows or by bringing up the full keypad, then tap either ""Pay"" or ""Request.""
If all you wanted was to request money, that's all you have to do — your payment won't go through until the other person accepts it on their end. If you're sending money, there's one more step.
5. The payment will appear in the text box. Double check that the amount is correct, then tap the send button, and verify with your Face ID, Touch ID, or Apple ID password.

"How to do a group FaceTime video or voice call on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac",https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-group-facetime,"Tue, 09 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"FaceTime is Apple's video calling app installed in its Macs, iPhones, and iPads.
FaceTime is like Google Hangouts or Zoom, but it only works between Apple devices, so you can't FaceTime your friend with an Android or PC. For this reason, it's good to have access to other platforms.
But it doesn't matter which Apple device you use to hop on a FaceTime call. Users of iPhone, iPad, and Mac can all join the same chats because the app is basically the same across all platforms.
Starting a group call on FaceTime takes only a few seconds, or minutes, depending on how many people you are adding to the call; groups can be as large as 32 devices. You can also join an existing group FaceTime call.
Group FaceTime calls are easier to start than group audio calls because you can call everyone at once instead of having to wait while merging calls.
Tap the participants at the top of the screen and hit the FaceTime icon.
 
Swipe up on this menu to make it larger, and find the ""Add Person"" option. It'll be under the list of people already on the call.
Once you've found them, tap their name and then the green ""Add Person to FaceTime"" button. They'll receive an invite immediately.
If your Mac and iPhone use the same Apple ID, all calls made to your number are answerable on either device. All you have to do is open FaceTime on your computer, click ""Preferences"" and check the box next to ""Calls from iPhone.""
If you're a Mac user, we recommend syncing your phone's address book to your computer. That way you won't have to manually enter two or more phone numbers when starting a call.
 
Hover your mouse over the FaceTime window so buttons appear at the bottom, and click the leftmost button.
A menu will appear from the left side of the window. Click ""Add Person"" under the list of current participants.
Find the person (or people) you want to add using their name, phone number, or email, and then click the green ""Add"" button. They'll be called immediately.
If a contact starts a group FaceTime, there are a few ways to join the call:

"We compared both 2020 13-inch MacBook Pro models to determine whether Apple's new M1 processor is better than Intel, and the M1 crushes its competition",https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/macbook-pro-13-2020-m1-vs-macbook-pro-13-2020-intel,"Wed, 03 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more

Apple's MacBook Pro laptops now come in two flavors: those powered by Apple's own M1 chip, and other models that run on Intel's processors. 
The newest 13-inch MacBook Pro and MacBook Air are among Apple's first computers to run on its own silicon, offering benefits like longer battery life and improved performance. Much like the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch all run on Apple's own processors, the company is transitioning its Mac lineup away from Intel and toward its own in-house chips.
But it might also leave you confused. 
You face a choice. Buy the new, trendy laptop with Apple's latest and greatest hardware, or go with the tried-and-true Intel option with room for more storage and ports? 
Updated on 3/2/21: Added more detail about the MacBook Pro's performance and webcam based on testing.
The MacBook Pro 13 with Apple M1 has a few important advantages. It's the most affordable model,at $1,299, and it has twice the battery life of Apple's MacBook Pro 13 with an Intel Core processor. The cheapest Intel-powered model you can get, by comparison starts at $1,799. Taken together, the M1-powered MacBook Pro's lower price, superior performance, and longer battery life make it the right choice for most people. 
But Intel models have an edge in high-end specifications, however, as they can be configured with more memory and more storage. Intel hardware is also a known quantity that can support all current Mac apps. Developers need to update their software to fully support Apple's M1 chip, though Apple claims that process is quite simple through its Rosetta 2 translation software. 
In our testing, popular apps like Microsoft Office, Slack, and Cisco WebEx worked just fine through Rosetta back when Apple's M1-powered laptops launched in November. However, if your job relies on using specific software that goes beyond basic web browsing and word processing, it's worth looking into whether the programs you need are M1-optimized. 
The M1-ready version of the app development platform Docker, for example, is still under development and in preview mode, according to the company's website. So an M1-powered Mac probably isn't the right choice just yet for computer programmers who rely on that software.
But on balance, the MacBook Pro 13 with Apple M1 is now the better option for most people, but it's not the obvious choice for everyone.
Apple's M1 processor is intimidating on paper. It's an 8-core CPU with four performance cores and four efficiency cores, and comes with an 8-core GPU, plus the 16-core ""Neural Engine"" that enhances certain machine learning algorithms.
Graphics performance is also a strength for the Macbook Pro 13 with Apple M1. Recent MacBook Pro 13 models have struggled with graphics because they relied on Intel's weak Iris Plus graphics. Apple's M1, however, has an 8-core graphics processor (GPU) similar to that found in the latest iPad Pro, a device known for impressive 3D graphics performance.
The differences are certainly noticeable in everyday tasks like gaming and encoding video. The M1 MacBook Pro is capable of encoding a 25-second 4K MOV video clip to a 1080p MP4 file in one minute and nine seconds, while the Intel-powered MacBook Pro does so in one minute and 17 seconds. 
Apple's M1 MacBook Pro is also much better at rendering graphics when playing ""Shadow of the Tomb Raider."" You shouldn't expect the M1 MacBook Pro to behave like a gaming rig by any means, but it holds its own when running the game at 1,650 x 1,050 and 1,200 x 800 resolutions. 
Graphics look much noisier with a lot more distortion on the Intel-powered MacBook Pro by comparison. (For reference, the Intel-equipped MacBook Pro I've been using for testing purposes launched in 2020 and has a quad-core Intel Core i5 processor with 16GB of memory.) 
The MacBook Pro with Apple's M1 chip also creams the Intel version in benchmark tests. On tests meant to evaluate the performance of a single processor core and how the cores work together, the M1 MacBook Pro scored an average of 1,754 and 7,699 respectively. The Intel MacBook Pro scored 1,097 on the single core test on average and 4,142 on the multi-core test.
In another Geekbench 5 test that measures GPU performance for tasks like gaming, image processing, and video editing, the M1 MacBook Pro scored 19,423 on average while the Intel MacBook Pro scored 8,707. 
On the other hand, the MacBook Pro 13 with Apple M1 faces limitations in memory and storage. It can only be configured with up to 16GB of memory (RAM) and up to 2TB of storage. Intel models can be upgraded to 32GB of RAM with up to 4TB of storage, and they also have four Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports while the M1 MacBook Pro only has two Thunderbolt/USB-4 ports.
Most people reading this don't need these upgrades, but they matter to professional videographers and photographers working with very large files and running multiple memory-hogging apps at once. If that sounds like you, you may want to skip Apple Silicon until the M1 is available with more memory and storage. 
In short, battery life is the real reason to buy Apple's M1 Pro laptop. The MacBook Pro 13-inch with Apple M1 doubles the quoted battery life of the MacBook Pro 13 with Intel hardware. The Apple M1 model claims up to 20 hours of battery life, while the Intel model promises up to 10 hours of time between charges. 
Both figures are a best-case scenario, so you can expect slightly less battery life in real-world use. Still, it's clear the Apple M1 chip is far more efficient. The size of the battery in each model is (almost) identical, so the endurance gains are coming from lower power draw, not a larger battery capacity. 
Twenty hours exceeds not only the endurance of most laptops, but also most smartphones and tablets. We haven't tested the M1 MacBook Pro's battery life yet, but the M1 MacBook Air blows our minds  with more than 12 hours of battery life, which is nearly double the longevity of the Intel-powered MacBook Air. Portability is the big, huge, obvious reason to buy the MacBook Pro 13 with Apple M1 over the Intel version.
Aside from the difference in ports, the Apple M1 and Intel versions of the MacBook Pro 13 look identical. They're the same in size and thickness. They offer the same color options (silver or space gray). The Apple M1 model is technically a tenth of a pound lighter, but that's a minor difference you'd struggle to notice even in a side-by-side comparison. They even use the same 61-watt USB-C power adapter. 
Both laptops also have the same 2,560 x 1,600 Retina display with True Tone white balance, support for P3 wide color, and 500 nits of brightness.
In other words, don't expect anyone to know you have the latest-and-greatest Mac with Apple Silicon. It looks like any other MacBook Pro 13. 


The Apple M1 MacBook Pro has most of the previous MacBook Pro 13's key features, such as the Touch Bar and TouchID fingerprint-based login security.
But the Apple M1 has an edge in wireless connectivity. Intel-powered models of the MacBook Pro 13 only support 802.11ac, or Wi-Fi 5, while the Apple M1 model supports 802.11ax, or Wi-Fi 6. This will only matter if you own a Wi-Fi 6 router, but including the latest Wi-Fi standard will help future-proof the laptop's connectivity. 
The M1 MacBook Pro also has a much better webcam than the Intel version, which is important now that we're socializing and holding work meetings virtually. Although both laptops have a 720p camera, Apple's M1 computers also have the company's image signal processor inside. 
When testing the Intel MacBook Pro's webcam alongside that of the M1-powered MacBook Pro, the difference was massive. The selfie taken on the M1 MacBook Pro's webcam had much better lighting, bolder color, and noticeably less grain than the one captured on the Intel MacBook Pro. 
Another perk that comes with M1-powered Macs is that iPhone apps can run directly on these laptops since they share a common architecture. That's not enough to significantly influence your buying decision, especially since Macs don't have the touchscreen support that bodes nicely with mobile apps, but it's still worth considering. 
The M1 MacBook Pro's speedy performance and long battery life alone make it the best choice for most people. In a sense, Apple is making your decision for you, because the MacBook Pro 13 with Apple M1 is the new entry-level model. You can't buy a new MacBook Pro 13 with Intel hardware for less than $1,799.
True professionals, especially more stationary ones, are likely  the exception. If you need the most storage, ports, and memory you can get in an Apple laptop, your best bet is an Intel MacBook Pro. Similarly, if having the certainty that Intel's platform offers when it comes to app compatibility is important, the M1 MacBook Pro also isn't for you. 
It's also worth noting that Apple is expected to release two new MacBook Pros in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes sometime this year that run on a new version of its chip, according to Bloomberg. If your current laptop is still working well, it might be worth waiting until the next version comes out.
Although there are some circumstances in which the Intel-based models are a better choice, the big gains Apple's M1 chip brings in performance and battery life make it the best option for most people.  The new laptops provide a first glimpse at what the Mac experience can be like when Apple has complete control over the enabling technologies that power it, and it's impressive so far.

It's time to retire comparisons between Apple and Tesla,https://www.businessinsider.com/its-time-to-retire-comparisons-between-apple-and-tesla-2021-3,"Sun, 14 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"For years, comparisons between Apple and Tesla haven't merely been commonplace — they've been expected. 
Some of this could be chalked up to timing. Apple co-founder and CEO Steve Jobs died in 2011, leaving the tech world with a visionary vacuum. Tesla was on the verge of launching its first original vehicle, the Model S sedan, positioning Elon Musk to assume Jobs' role as America's reigning business futurist.
Tesla was also a creation of Silicon Valley. The indigenous US auto industry was represented by the Big Three — General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler — which had emerged in Detroit a century before, when California was better known for a burgeoning film industry and as an agricultural powerhouse.
Tesla was, therefore, the new Apple, Musk the next Jobs, and the goal of creating an all-electric automobile that would rescue the planet from global warming was the 21st-century version of the personal computer revolution that Apple had led in the 1980s.
It sounded great, but there was a problem: Musk wasn't playing along.
Instead, he was to emulate a much, much older American visionary: Henry Ford.
Ford pioneered the moving assembly line to build the Model T, cutting production time to 90 minutes and making it the most successful vehicle of its age. Later, Ford created the paradigm for what we now call ""vertical integration"" in manufacturing: the River Rouge plant in Michigan, which was completed in 1928 and at one point literally had train cars filled with iron ore rolling up to one end of the facility, finished cars rolling out the other.
Musk is obsessed with this famous factory's legacy, in part because the global car business completely abandoned vertical integration in the 1980s. Toyota developed a new production system that emphasized greatly reduced inventories and enabled automakers to dial-up or dial-down manufacturing depending on consumer demand. In combination with far-flung global supply chains, a new process called ""lean"" manufacturing displaced vertical integration.
But Musk wants Tesla to push manufacturing into a new, highly automated, 21st-century iteration, and for that, he needs to control far more of what goes into every Tesla vehicle, from batteries to seats, software to windshield glass, self-driving sensors to chassis components. 
This back-to-the-future approach means that Tesla is, in fact, doing the opposite of what Apple has done. Cupertino is certainly invested in owning the user experience, establishing what's often termed a ""walled garden"" ecosystem where an Apple person lives in an all-Apple world.
However, Apple in essence is a design, software, and marketing company that manufactures effectively nothing except intellectual property and staggering profit margins. Millions of iPhones have been assembled by partners in Asia, and it's a testament to CEO Tim Cook's genius and supply-chain management that Apple has thrived in the post-Job era.
Tesla, meanwhile, is trending toward manufacturing just about everything that goes into its vehicles. In fact, Musk has frequently complained that the carmaker's progress has a speed limit set by exactly one obstacle: the company's slowest supplier.
Musk has been admirably stubborn in sticking to his gameplan, going so far as to openly criticize the so-called Toyota Production System, a jaw-dropping but understandable move. He thinks Tesla can do better, with quickly built factories that are filled with robots rather than human workers. He dreams of cars being built like Coca-Cola is currently bottled, on whirring automated assembly lines, and Tesla has started to explore this innovation in the fabrication of its new, larger lithium-ion battery cells. (Tesla has also seen the dream turn nightmarish when it attempted to automate the assembly line for its Model 3 sedan in 2017 and had to resort to throwing up a legitimately Henry Ford-era temporary line under a tent in its parking lot.)
That doesn't mean competitors aren't looking to emulate the Apple model and produce the iPhone of cars. Apple itself is probably looking to follow its own model, with its fraught Project Titan effort. Serial entrepreneur Henrik Fisker has stressed that his new company, Fisker Inc., is pursuing an ""asset-light"" approach, partnering with Canada's Magna International to build a debut vehicle, the Ocean SUV, by 2022, and joining with noted iPhone-maker Foxconn to produce another, dubbed ""Project PEAR,"" by 2023.
The traditional auto industry is splitting the difference. General Motors is investing $27 billion to roll out 30 EVs by 2025 — and the automaking giant is both converting existing factories to EV production while partnering with battery supplier LG Chem to build a new factory in Ohio. If you wanted to break it down, you could say that GM is aiming to be asset-medium, versus Fisker's asset-light and Tesla's asset-heavy.
Each system has a reasonable shot at winning. GM knows what it's doing. Tesla could slash the amount of time it takes to get factories up and running and cars rolling off the lines. Fisker could rapidly establish a fresh transportation brand, accomplishing in two years what Tesla needed two decades to achieve.
But one thing is for sure: Tesla is absolutely, positively not the Apple of cars. It's about time to retire that comparison, once and for all.

Saudi Aramco loses title of world's most profitable company to Apple,https://www.businessinsider.com/saudi-aramco-2020-profit-drops-49-billion-pandemic-lower-demand-2021-3,"Sun, 21 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Saudi Aramco is no longer the world's most profitable company after the COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on oil demand in 2020.
Aramco reported its full-year 2020 results on Sunday, showing a 44% collapse in profits to $49 billion. The world's largest oil company said that despite the results, it plans to pay out its full-year dividend of $75 billion.
""As the enormous impact of COVID-19 was felt throughout the global economy, we intensified our strong emphasis on capital and operational efficiencies,"" Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said.
Demand for oil was hit hard in 2020 as rolling lockdowns to combat the pandemic led to reduced travel across the globe. Oil briefly went negative, hitting $-37 per barrel as an imbalance between oil supply and demand led to limited places for storage of the commodity.
Aramco said its results were impacted by both lower crude oil prices and lower volumes sold, as well as weakened margins for its refining and chemicals business. 
The results from Aramco mean Apple can now claim the title of the world's most profitable company, as it reported $59 billion in income for 2020. But that title may be short lived for Apple and could be reclaimed by Aramco, based on a strong rebound in oil prices so far in 2021 and Aramco's 2019 profit of $88 billion. 
Energy represents the best performing sector so far in 2021, as WTI crude oil prices have surged 30% year-to-date.
In the year ahead, Aramco expects to spend $35 billion in capital expenditures, well below its previous guidance for $40 billion to $45 billion in spending. 
""Looking ahead, our long-term strategy to optimize our oil and gas portfolio is on track and, as the macro environment improves, we are seeing a pick-up in demand in Asia and also positive signs elsewhere. We remain confident that we will emerge on the other side of this pandemic in a position of strength,"" Nasser said.

"Wikipedia contracts with Apple, Google could fund global initiatives",https://www.businessinsider.com/wikipedia-contracts-with-apple-google-could-fund-global-initiatives-2021-3,"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Big tech's relationship with Wikipedia could undergo a massive shift this year.
On March 16, Wikipedia announced a historic Enterprise API tool, allowing businesses to better integrate Wikipedia content to their products. Wired first reported the news. 
Today, Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri, and Google use Wikipedia to answer user questions — but they don't pay anything to the free encyclopedia.
The new enterprise contracts would transform the free encyclopedia's relationship with corporations and level the playing field with tech giants like Apple and Amazon.
""We want the bigger users of the content to contribute back,"" Lisa Seitz-Gruwell, the chief advancement officer at the Wikimedia Foundation, said in an interview with Insider. ""And I should say, many of them  have given us donations, but many of them haven't. So [an enterprise contract] makes that more consistent.""
Read more: Leaked Google internal survey shows employee wellbeing has dropped, leading company to respond with new perks
The new Enterprise contracts will be opt-in, meaning companies can still use Wikipedia the way they are now without paying. The non-profit said the contracts will also set up better guidelines for attributing Wikipedia content.
Wikipedia, which has been funded solely through donations and grant funding since it launched in 2001, has never charged businesses for the product. Cofounders Larry Sanger and Jimmy Wales launched Wikipedia in 2001 on the principle of free, decentralized information, similar to the open-source movement for software. It's the only top 20 most visited digital platform operated by a non-profit, per Comscore. 
""We are so lucky we are funded by about 8 million people around the world who donate an average of $15. These people are a part of our community,"" Seitz-Gruwell told Insider. ""That's going to continue to be the main way that the Wikimedia foundation is funded.""
Though large tech organizations have used Wikipedia's information for their own products for years, the non-profit site launched Enterprise API now because of the time it takes volunteers to communicate and decide on an action, Seitz-Gruwell said. She said the group has 280,000 volunteers closely involved with Wikipedia, including 80,000 active editors.
Apple and Google are listed as Wikimedia's ""major benefactors,"" having donated more than $50,000 between 2017 and 2018. Amazon donated $1 million to Wikipedia in 2018 following after failing to appear on a list of the organization's top corporate donors. 
Seitz-Gruwell said the firm wants to remain funded primarily through donations and grants, and does not foresee contracts making up a large part of Wikimedia's revenue. The non-profit recorded $180 million in net assets in 2020 from donations and grants.
Instead of using donor money to build tools for tech firms, Wikipedia will use money through the business contracts. That way, Wikipedia uses companies' own money to build products for them. If successful, Wikipedia plans to use extra money generated from contracts to build better products for emerging markets in Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia.
""By 2030, one of the things that we want is to achieve something called knowledge equity, which really means we want to grow in emerging markets really significantly over the next 10 years,"" Seitz-Gruwell said. ""That requires additional resources, increased investment, and we are hopeful that enterprise can help get us the resources to grow around the world.""
Amazon, Apple, and Google were not immediately available for additional comment.

"Apple pays artists a penny per stream, more than Spotify",https://www.businessinsider.com/spotify-pays-artists-half-apple-penny-per-stream-2021-4,"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple Music is telling artists that it will start paying one cent per stream. 
The company told artists the news in a letter, which was viewed by Insider, that will be posted on the platform's artist dashboard on Friday. The Wall Street Journal first reported the letter.
""As the discussion about streaming royalties continues, we believe it is important to share our values,"" Apple said in the letter. ""We believe in paying every creator the same rate, that a play has value, and that creators should never have to pay for featuring.""
In November, the largest music streaming platform, Spotify, told artists they could promote their music to more users in exchange for lower royalty payments. 
Apple in the letter also said it pays 52 cents of every dollar to record labels. Apple did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
Apple's new penny-per-stream move is notably one that the reigning streaming giant, Spotify, has not made. It has 155 million paying subscribers and pays less than a cent for every song streamed — somewhere between $.003 and $.005.
Apple's proposed rate increase then amounts to about double what Spotify pays per stream. Spotify did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment.
Read more: You can now stream Spotify directly on the Apple Watch.
Streaming companies pay royalties to rights holders and other intermediaries, like publishers, distributors, and record labels, before the money eventually is distributed to the artists.
In March, Spotify unveiled a website that attempts to break down some of the data on how it distributes payments, including a tiered look at the recording and publishing revenues generated by artists' catalogs. Only about 13,400 catalogs were generating $50,000 — or the equivalent of a livable wage in the US — in 2020, as Music Business Worldwide reported.
Artists across the industry have been critical of Spotify's payouts. The Union of Musicians and Allied Workers, which consists of more than 27,000 figures within the music industry, has called on Spotify to increase its royalty payments to one penny per stream. The group is also asking the platform to adopt a user-centric model. That means that streaming services would pay artists based on a fan's total listening time, a practice that SoundCloud took on in March.

As originally reported by The Record, members of a ransomware group known as REvil say they stole Apple product blueprints from a Taiwanese company named Quanta, which is an Apple supplier.
Per The Record, REvil hackers posted on a dark-web forum that they approached Apple after Quanta refused to pay the ransom of $50 million.
REvil posted product schematics for what appeared to be Macbooks and the Apple Watch, as reviewed by multiple outlets — although it's impossible to verify whether they are authentic. According to the Record, the group threatened to post more data every day that its ransom wasn't met.
In messages reviewed by both The Record and Bloomberg, REvil has given Apple a May 1 deadline.
""Our team is negotiating the sale of large quantities of confidential drawings and gigabytes of personal data with several major brands ... We recommend that Apple buy back the available data by May 1,"" the group said, per The Record's reporting.

"How to use apple cider vinegar to help you lose weight, according to dietitians",https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/health/diet-nutrition/apple-cider-vinegar-weight-loss,"Thu, 01 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The wellness trend of drinking apple cider vinegar — or fermented apple juice — has recently gained popularity due to claims it aids in weight loss, among many other benefits. While some small studies indicate apple cider vinegar may help with weight loss, more research is needed to determine its long-term effects and overall health benefits. 
Here's what the research says about apple cider vinegar and weight loss, and what you need to know before trying it. 
Yes, apple cider vinegar may help with weight loss according to some small studies, but it most likely will not help you shed substantial pounds, says Daniela Novotny, RD, a senior instructor of biomedical sciences at Missouri State University. 
Studies on the effects of apple cider vinegar so far are small and more research is needed to draw definitive conclusions about its effects, says Melissa Mitri, a registered dietitian with her own private practice. Here is what the research says: 
Other studies have shown that vinegar may also increase satiety, resulting in fewer calories consumed and, therefore, aid weight loss. 
Medical term: Satiety is the feeling of fullness after eating. Increasing satiety means you are less likely to overeat, which causes you to consume fewer calories.
Therefore, apple cider vinegar may have a modest effect on weight loss, but studies so far on the topic are limited, and more substantial research is needed, Mitri says. 
For the most part, apple cider vinegar is safe to consume, Novotny says. But, due to its high acidity, there are some potential side effects, like:
When consumed in moderation, apple cider vinegar doesn't appear to pose any significant health risks, Novotny says. If you do decide to try apple cider vinegar for weight loss, here are some safe ways to consume it:
General advice: For weight loss, Mitri recommends consuming apple cider vinegar in the morning or right before a meal as there is some evidence it may help with satiety. 
Since the research hasn't definitively proven apple cider vinegar helps with weight loss for all, there isn't good data to suggest how long you may need to take it to see results. The limited human studies suggest apple cider vinegar may help promote weight loss in obese people over a three-month period, but larger studies are needed in order to make recommendations, Mitri says. 
Important: When incorporated as part of a well-rounded diet, apple cider vinegar may help you lose weight. However, developing an individualized weight loss plan focused on nutrition and exercise with your doctor or a registered dietitian is likely to be more effective, Novotny says. 
Some small studies have indicated apple cider vinegar may help with weight loss, but more research is needed. Even so, it most likely will not help you shed substantial pounds, and it's best to create a comprehensive weight loss plan with a doctor or registered dietitian.
If you decide to try apple cider vinegar, dilute it in water or use it to make your own salad dressing. If you decide to consume apple cider vinegar stick to about one to two tablespoons a day.

Apple Refusing to Testify at Antitrust Hearing: Report,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-refuse-testify-senate-hearing-april-2021-4,"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple is refusing to testify at an April hearing about antitrust concerns, Reuters first reported on Friday.
The hearing will discuss Apple and Google's app store policies and allegations of anticompetitive behavior.
Both companies take a 30% cut from in-app purchases, according to their policies. Developers have long taken issue with the practice since they claim that the 30% fee gives Apple an unfair advantage in the market, as its own apps are exempt from paying the fee.
Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Arizona wrote a letter to Apple CEO Tim Cook, imploring that the company consider attending the hearing. A spokesperson with Klobuchar's office shared the letter with Insider.
""A little more than two weeks before the planned hearing, Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness,"" the letter reads. ""Apple's sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify ... is unacceptable.""
Klobuchar's team, according to Reuters, said Google has agreed to testify at the hearing. The hearing was planned for later this month but does not yet have a date set in stone, per the outlet.
Apple and Google did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. 
Tech's biggest execs have become familiar with congressional hearings in the past year as scrutiny of the industry has increased and bipartisan support for regulation grows. The hearings typically include Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple and/or Twitter.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai, and Twitter helmer Jack Dorsey testified at a congressional misinformation hearing in late March. The hearing was scheduled to discuss how misinformation, specifically that related to the pandemic and the 2020 presidential election, spreads on these online platforms. The hearing oftentimes devolved into political theatre, as has been typical with these sorts of proceedings.
Apple will appear in a federal trial in May to fight game giant Epic Games after their brawl kicked off last August. Epic, the owner of the popular ""Fortnite"" game, introduced its own payment service into the app, skirting Apple's 30% cut from in-app purchases. In response, Apple and Google kicked Epic off its app stores, preventing customers from accessing ""Fortnite."" Epic sued both companies shortly after.
Dear Mr. Cook:
We write regarding Apple Inc.'s refusal to provide a witness to testify in a timely manner before the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights at a hearing to examine the competition issues raised by app stores.
More than half of internet traffic comes through mobile phones, whose users rely on mobile applications to access online content and services—and the vast majority of mobile apps are downloaded from either Apple's App Store or Google's Play Store. Apple's power over the cost, distribution, and availability of mobile applications on the Apple devices used by millions of consumers raises serious competition issues that are of interest to the Subcommittee, consumers, and app developers. A full and fair examination of these issues before the Subcommittee requires Apple's participation.
Apple has been aware for weeks that the Subcommittee was planning a hearing on this topic and was engaged in discussions with our staff regarding who would testify on Apple's behalf. Yet a little more than two weeks [16 days] before the planned hearing, Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness to testify at a hearing in April.
Earlier this year, Apple provided witnesses to testify before the North Dakota Senate and the Arizona House of Representatives to oppose state bills that would regulate the very same conduct that the Subcommittee intends to explore. You testified before the House Antitrust Subcommittee regarding these same issues last year. And on the exact day Apple informed the Subcommittee that it would not provide a witness for an April hearing, the New York Times released a podcast interview in which you discuss competition issues relating to Apple's App Store, including Apple's pending litigation with Epic Games.
Finally, your staff has noted ongoing litigation as the reason for not providing a witness this month. Many other representatives of companies, both inside and outside of the technology sector, have testified before Congress in similar circumstances, and your staff was aware of the ongoing litigation when they were initially working with us to provide a witness. Apple's sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable.
We strongly urge Apple to reconsider its position and to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee in a timely manner.
Thank you for your urgent attention to this matter.

"Apple's iPad Pro has all of the makings of a great computer, but it's still not ready to replace my laptop",https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/apple-ipad-pro-2020-review,"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more

Apple took another step in turning the iPad into a viable laptop alternative in 2020, thanks to two important launches: its powerful iPad Pro, and a software update that makes Apple's current iPad lineup compatible with computer mice and trackpads.
The latter is a long-awaited feature that makes Apple's tablets much more useful when it comes to work-related tasks. It's especially important for the productivity-oriented iPad Pro, which starts at $800 if you opt for the 11-inch version and $1,000 if you get the larger 12.9-inch version.
Apple is positioning the iPad Pro not as a laptop replacement, but as a new type of computer that can handle everything a traditional laptop can and more. In terms of achieving that goal, Apple's newest iPad Pro succeeds in some regards and falls short in others.
Yes, the iPad Pro's slim and light design, smooth touchscreen with support for Apple Pencil, and powerful cameras make it ideal for certain situations that a regular laptop would be less-equipped to handle.
However, since it runs on software that was designed with mobile-first usage in mind, it's also struggled to feel as seamless and natural when being used as a laptop. Its lack of mouse support was one of the major factors contributing to that latter point — until now.
Overall, the 2020 iPad Pro impresses with sharp design, fast performance, long battery life, and useful trackpad support. But, even with these benefits, there's still a learning curve you'll have to embrace if you want to use it as your everyday work machine. Here's a closer look at what it's been like to use the new iPad Pro.
But it would be wise to hold off on purchasing just yet. Apple is holding an event on April 20th where refreshed iPad Pros are expected to make their debut. These new iPads are expected to be even better-equipped for productivity, as Bloomberg reports they'll come with faster processors similar to Apple's M1 chip. The larger model may also have a new mini-LED screen with better contrast. 
Updated on 4/14/21 by Sarah Lord: This story was originally published on 4/14/20 but has been updated to include details on new iPad Pro models expected to debut soon. 
Before we dig in, here's a look at what you'll get with the base model, which has an 11-inch screen and starts at $800. For this review, I used the 12.9-inch model with 1TB of storage.
The iPad Pro may be Apple's largest and most powerful iPad, but it's still impressively thin and light. At 0.23 inches thin, it's just about as slim as the iPad Air and a bit sleeker than the 0.33-inch Microsoft Surface Pro 7.  It's also lighter than Microsoft's productivity tablet: the 12.9-inch iPad Pro with Wi-Fi and cellular weighs 643 grams, while the Surface Pro 7 weighs 775 grams, if you're going for a Pro 7 with an Intel Core i3 or i5 chip — which you should. 
Like the 2018 iPad Pro, the 2020 version has noticeably narrower bezels framing its screen compared to the iPad Air and entry-level iPad. That also means there's no home button, so you'll have to use Face ID or a passcode to unlock the device and swipe up from the bottom of the screen to navigate home.
The 12.9-inch iPad Pro's 2,732 x 2,048 display is vibrant, smooth, and sharp. It has a higher 120Hz refresh rate through a feature Apple calls ProMotion, which not only prevents any lag while using the Apple Pencil, but also makes the interface feel snappier overall since the screen feels more responsive. The iPad Pro display also supports True Tone color adjusting technology, which has become a mainstay of Apple's products, making the screen feel warmer and less blue than some non-Apple alternatives. 
Being able to use a mouse and trackpad has been a game changer for the iPad Pro. Although the iPad Pro's software needs some work before it can truly take over for my laptop, I wouldn't have even considered using an iPad as my daily driver before Apple added this capability.
But, don't expect it to feel like the mouse and trackpad experience on a Mac or PC. Apple has tailored the way the cursor works to make it fit more smoothly with the iPad's interface. The cursor conforms to specific buttons and elements through the iPad's software. When viewing apps in split screen mode, for example, your cursor will take the shape of the dividing line in the center of the screen, making it easy to be precise.
Although computer mice will work just fine with the iPad, I found that trackpads offer a far superior experience. That's because you can use a lot of the familiar gestures you're accustomed to on the touchscreen, like swiping up to access the dock, with a trackpad. When using a mouse, I more often found myself switching between using the touchscreen and the mouse, whereas I felt like I was able to accomplish everything I needed with just the trackpad.
Apple has added a lot of features to the iPad in recent years that make it better-equipped to handle work-related tasks. There's a proper file manager in Apple's Files app, for example, which lets you access documents stored on your iPad and in other places, like iCloud Drive. It's also added the ability to view apps in split-screen mode, support for external drives in the Files app, and a new home screen that lets you see information like upcoming calendar appointments alongside your apps, among other improvements.
While these are all helpful and appreciated changes, you should still expect to encounter a learning curve if you're planning to use the iPad Pro for many of the same tasks as your Mac or PC laptop. You can't drag, drop, and resize windows around the home screen like you can in a desktop environment, which in my experience can make it hard to get the most out of the iPad Pro's 12.9-inch display. Instead, if you want to work quickly you'd better get deeply acquainted with Apple's multitasking gestures.
Apple's Slide Over and Split View features are the closest you'll get to this experience, but they're still not quite the same. With Slide Over, you can open an app in a sidebar and position it alongside the left or right side of the screen. Split View, as its name implies, allows you to view two apps simultaneously alongside one another. You can also open a third app in Slide Over while two apps are running in Split View. 
There are also still some aspects of the way I work that don't translate particularly well to mobile. For example, I typically keep services like Google Drive and Slack open in my web browser, since I find it easier to quickly switch between tabs rather than navigating between different programs. This can be annoying, and in some cases impossible on the iPad. Google encourages you to use the Drive app instead, and Slack requires you to download the app to use it on mobile devices.
That means my only choices are quickly jumping between Slack and Google Chrome throughout the workday, or keeping Slack open in split screen or slide-over view, both of which are more cramped experiences than I'd like.
That's not to say the recent features aren't a big improvement. Being able to view two apps alongside one another and easily access files saved in iCloud Drive means I'm able to get a meaningful amount of work done on the iPad Pro that I would have struggled with in the past. But, it's just not seamless enough to take over as my primary work device just yet.   
Where the iPad Pro has the potential to truly shine over a laptop is in its performance. While opening more than a dozen tabs on my new 2020 MacBook Air and 2017 MacBook Pro will sometimes result in sluggish performance and whirring fans, this was never an issue on the iPad Pro. I breezed through my work with more than 12 tabs open without and stuttering, lag, or overheating.
Apple's 2020 iPad Pro runs on the company's new A12Z processor, which Apple claims should offer more power and sharper graphics, thanks in part to improvements in the GPU's thermal architecture and performance controllers. The previous generation iPad Pro, by comparison, is powered by Apple's A12X chipset. Apple's A12Z has eight processing cores, while the Microsoft Surface Pro 7 is configurable up to a quad-core Intel 10th generation Core i7 processor. 
Apple claims that the iPad Pro can last for up to 10 hours while browsing the web on Wi-Fi or streaming video, and I find that to be generally accurate. I used the iPad Pro sporadically over the course of about a week, which typically involved using it as my main work computer for a portion of the work day and then using it to browse the web, shoot and render video clips, manage email, and occasionally use AR apps otherwise.
Overall, I used the iPad Pro for about 10 hours before the battery died, which seems to line up with Apple's projections. It's important to remember, however, that battery life will always vary depending on how you use your device. If you're consistently streaming video or editing high-resolution footage, or if you keep the screen brightness high, your battery will probably drain faster. 
If you're planning to take photos or shoot video with your iPad Pro, you can expect similar image quality to the iPhone 11. Like Apple's iPhone, the iPad Pro has a wide-angle camera and an ultra-wide-angle camera, except there's one important difference.
While both devices have a 12-megapixel wide camera, the iPad Pro has a 10-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera, which is a slightly lower resolution than the iPhone 11's 12-megapixel ultra-wide-angle shooter. There's also a 7-megapixel camera for selfies and video calls, which is also isn't as sharp as the iPhone 11's 12-megapixel selfie camera.
Still, the iPad Pro does offer higher resolution cameras than the Surface Pro 7, which has an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. 
But, it's the iPad Pro's LiDAR sensor that Apple is strongly positioning as being one of the characteristics that makes it stand out. This sensor is geared toward improving performance in augmented reality (AR) apps, as it measures the distance between objects by detecting how long it takes for light to reach an object and reflect back.
In general, most of the AR apps I used on the iPad Pro were capable of detecting surfaces quick and easily. However, existing AR apps will have to build support for Apple's new Scene Geometry application programming interface (API) into their apps to get the most out of the iPad Pro's LiDAR sensor. That tool should help developers build apps that can more accurately understand the size and dimensions of your environment.
Apple's Measure app is probably the best and most practical example of how the new Scene Geometry API and LiDAR sensor can be put to good use. When used on the LiDAR-equipped iPad Pro, the digital tape measure app can provide horizontal and vertical guide lines and instantly measure a person's height from the floor to the top of their head.
Overall, the iPad Pro is faster and more accurate when it comes to detecting surfaces through the Measure app than my iPhone 11 Pro. When trying to measure the length of my couch, for example, the iPad Pro detects the surface nearly instantly, whereas my iPhone is a little slower to recognize the starting point.
The iPad Pro's biggest drawback is that it's expensive, and that high price can make you question whether a laptop or a cheaper tablet may be better suited for your needs. 
The iPad Pro starts at $800 for the 11-inch model and $1,000 for  the 12.9-inch version, with the latter being the same price as the newest MacBook Air. That price gets even higher when you tack on the accessories that make the iPad Pro so appealing in the first place.
The newest Apple Pencil will cost you $130, while the company's Smart Folio Keyboard costs $180 for the 11-inch model and $200 for its larger sibling. Apple's brand-new Magic Keyboard is priced at $300 for the 11-inch model and $350 for the 12.9-inch version.
That means, if you're opting for the smaller iPad Pro even with a basic keyboard that lacks a trackpad, then you're still spending nearly $1,000. 
The iPad Pro is a powerful, sleek  computer with a fantastic display and long battery life. Support for trackpads and computer mice only makes it more useful as a productivity machine, making it possible to get real work done on the iPad for the first time. 
That being said, the software experience still isn't quite as capable and flexible as that of a laptop running on macOS or Windows. You can't, for example, launch multiple apps in floating windows as you would on a laptop. 
The iPad Pro is also expensive, and getting the most out the experience by adding one of Apple's keyboard accessories or the Apple Pencil will require even more spending. The iPad Pro may be ideal for artists, designers, and architects that could greatly benefit from using a computer that can scan it's environment using high-quality cameras or that has a super-responsive screen for lag-free digital sketching.
But, if you're looking for a tablet for web browsing, occasional note taking, managing email, and watching Netflix, the less expensive $500 iPad Air may be a better option.
Or, if you're looking for a laptop that's as portable and flexible as a tablet, it may be worth considering Microsoft's Surface Pro 7 or another Windows-based laptop-tablet hybrid.
Pros: Long battery life, lightweight design, trackpad support makes it easier to get work done, fast performance
Cons: Expensive, software is still somewhat limiting compared to a laptop

"An MBA helped a consultant get job offers from Apple, EY, and HP",https://www.businessinsider.com/mba-part-time-consultant-job-offers-apple-ey-hp-2021-4,"Tue, 06 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Lisa Andrea, 32, knew exactly what she wanted to do after college: She wanted to pursue her MBA, become a certified public accountant, and work for a Big Four accounting firm.
""That was my dream,"" Andrea, who asked to use a different last name in compliance with her company, told Insider.
But with student loans to cover, she decided to take on a full-time role right after school — having graduated in under four years — save some money, and build up her résumé.
After she spent two years working in marketing, she enrolled in a part-time MBA program at San Diego State University with an emphasis on accounting, which required her to study twice a week at night for four hours.
""I had talked with many C-suite executives of different corporations before applying to grad programs to get their advice on the type of school to go to,"" she said about her application process. ""Unanimously, every person I spoke with said not to spend the money on an expensive university, unless it was a top-10 program like Yale, Harvard, etc.""
Andrea is glad she listened to their advice. Instead of ending up with a price tag upward of $200,000, she paid about $20,000 total in tuition. It took her two years (with summer school) to finish.
""Since I was very diligent about not wasting any money, I planned my entire schedule for the two years before I started the program,"" Andrea said. ""I wanted to make sure I didn't waste any time or money. So I made sure to plan my schedule so that my classes could be taken at the proper times to stay on track.""
The MBA candidate also tested out of nine units based on curricula from her undergraduate degree, so she took the exact number of classes that were required.
Through San Diego State's job-postings website, Andrea ended up getting a high-paying internship with the Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young in the last semester of her MBA program.
""I quit my marketing job that I really loved to go after my dream of being a CPA,"" she said.
After she completed the six-month internship, Andrea was offered a full-time position at EY. But she had other offers as well. During her internship, she had applied to jobs online and interviewed at other Fortune 100 companies, finding posting through her school's MBA career site and on her own.
""I was then faced with four incredible job offers from Fortune 100 companies — two of which were Apple and HP — all because of my MBA,"" Andrea said. ""This is one of the biggest advantages to a graduate program. Access to employers that want you.""
In the end, Andrea ended up turning down offers from Ernst & Young and Apple — two of her dream offers. ""Yes, that's still crazy to say,"" she said.
She accepted the job at HP, she said, because it offered her four times as much money as the other options.
""I decided I couldn't ignore something like that,"" she said. ""At 24 years old, my new job allowed me to pay off my MBA and undergraduate degree very quickly.""
For the past eight years, Andrea has been working as a business-development consultant — a job that she loves.
""I work from home, travel the world, have given speeches in front of thousands of people, and have worked with some of the largest organizations in the world,"" she said. ""The opportunities that have opened for me are truly incredible.""
On the side, she's the owner of The Financial Cookbook, which she uses to provide career-empowerment coaching to other women. Andrea started her business because she realized there was a market gap between what people learn in school about personal finances and the real-world needs that people face with money management.
""Some people live unfulfilling careers or struggle with financial freedom simply because they don't know what they don't know,"" she said.
Andrea attributes her successful job experiences in the corporate world, as well as her ability to launch her own venture, to earning her MBA. ""Do I use my MBA now, or do I need it for my current job? No,"" she said. ""Was it worth it, and would I recommend it? One hundred percent yes.""
Having an MBA changes the game in many ways for those who earn one, she added.
""Employers saw me differently from the undergraduates I was up against,"" she said. ""Getting a graduate degree has an unsaid connotation behind it. It says to the employer that you're a go-getter who wants to expand your horizons and learn.""
She also said it was extremely impressive to the companies where she interviewed that she already had four years of full-time work experience under her belt. ""This showed them how strong my work ethic is since I was working full time and going to school at night,"" she said.
""Most top executives have a graduate degree,"" Andrea added. ""Therefore, when they realize that you do as well, they view you differently. You now have additional topics to converse about. It helps you to build rapport with others in life and executives within your organization.""

Apple's colorful new iMac is the computer I wish I had this whole time while working from home,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/apple-imac-review-2021,"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission.

When Apple launched the original iMac more than 20 years ago, it popularized the idea that computers didn't have to look like utilitarian beige boxes. Now, Apple is reviving that approach in 2021.
The new 24-inch iMac, which starts at $1,300 and launches on May 21, comes in a range of vibrant pastel colors and a stunning new slim design. More importantly, it's also more powerful than its predecessor, thanks to the inclusion of Apple's M1 chip. Apple has given the speakers and webcam a much-appreciated upgrade for the work-from-home era, too.
The iMac is far from being the most affordable all-in-one computer you can buy. But the benefits it brings are worth the price for Mac fans in need of a sleek yet powerful desktop with a high-resolution screen.
My only complaints about the new iMac are the same ones that I tend to have about every Apple product. The port selection is fairly limited, and there isn't much flexibility in terms of pricing and customization compared to Windows machines. I also wish Apple would have brought some of the innovative features found on its other devices —like the iPad Pro's Center Stage — to the iMac.
Starts with 256GB solid state drive (SSD), up to 2TB
The iMac is nothing short of striking. It's only 11.5 millimeters thin, which makes it easy to fit on the dining room table that's doubled as my work desk during the pandemic.
It's not just the new iMac's thin profile that makes it stand out. Apple has also significantly slimmed down the borders surrounding its screen, allowing for a more modern and streamlined look I've been dying to see on the Macbook Air and Pro. 
But of course, it's the iMac's dazzling range of color options that really steal the show when it comes to looks. The $1,300 model comes in blue, green, pink, and silver, while the pricier configuration is available in these colors plus yellow, orange, and purple. That makes the iMac fit in nicely with the colorful iPhone 12 and iPad Air lineup.
Each iMac also comes with a matching Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse, and the power cord also comes in a new woven texture of the same color that feels more durable. There's also a USB-C to Lightning cable with the same woven build in the box as well.
The iMac's 24-inch 4.5K resolution display is also part of what sets it apart from the competition. It's hard to find an all-in-one desktop computer of this size with such a high resolution screen. HP's 4K all-in-one computers, for example, only come in larger sizes like 31.5 inches, while Dell's Inspiron all-in-ones have 1080p screens. 
Those who are primarily interested in getting an all-in-one computer for video editing or watching movies certainly won't be disappointed. The iMac displays rich and vibrant colors with plenty of brightness and detail, which is noticeable when watching ""The Great British Baking Show"" and ""Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle"" on Netflix. The viewing angles are also excellent, which should make the iMac ideal if you're using it to watch a movie with a friend or collaborate on a project with a coworker.
The iMac comes with Apple's M1 chip, which blew me away with its faster performance and long battery life when I first tested the latest MacBook Air in 2020. 
In the iMac, the M1 chip brings performance that's faster than a high-end laptop with the latest Intel processor, but not quite as speedy as desktop computers with dedicated high-end graphics. That's exactly what's expected of a computer like the iMac, which is intended to be a general-use productivity machine rather than a pro-level desktop.
For example, the iMac can encode a 10-minute 4K video clip to 1080p about 10 minutes faster than a Dell XPS 13 laptop with an 11th-generation Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM. But the M1's integrated graphics processing unit is still no match for the desktop computer in my basement that my husband built several years ago, which includes an MSI RTX 2070 graphics card with 8GB of video RAM.
The iMac is also faster than Dell's laptop when processing photo edits in Adobe Lightroom. Both computers are capable of exporting a 4.7 megabyte image quickly, but the iMac does the job in just 1.4 seconds versus Dell's 5 seconds.
Otherwise the iMac handles my daily workflow with ease, which consists of opening more than a dozen tabs in Safari and using apps like Slack and Cisco Webex. 
But similarly-priced all-in-ones, like the $1,185.79 Dell Inspiron 24 5000 and $1,000 HP Pavilion 24,offer more memory at the base level and many more ports compared to the iMac. 
More than a year after many of us started working from home, it's become painfully obvious how poor the webcams and speakers are on many laptops. That's one area Apple has really paid attention to on the new iMac, which comes with a 1080p webcam that uses Apple's image signal processor, a six-speaker sound system, and a three-microphone array.
Not only is the webcam quality better than laptops I've tried, but it also surpasses the dedicated 1080p Logitech webcam I've been comparing it with. Take a look at the images below, and you'll notice that the one taken on the iMac is brighter and more detailed. 
Apple iMac
Logitech Webcam
However, I do think there's an opportunity for Apple to make the webcam even more useful. The Mac still doesn't have Face ID despite the fact that Windows Hello is becoming standard on many Windows computers. Touch ID comes built into the iMac's keyboard, but you have to opt for one of the pricier configurations, or pay $50 extra to add it to the $1,300 model.
Given that Apple is positioning the iMac as being a multipurpose computer for the kitchen, den, bedroom, and home office, I wish the webcam had a privacy shutter. A visible green light turns on to let you know when the camera is active, but a shutter would provide even more peace of mind. 
It also strikes me as odd that Apple didn't include a smart home hub in the new iMac as it has in the HomePod, Apple TV, and iPad. Again, considering the iMac is meant to be a central part of the home, it seems like a natural fit.
And finally, it would have been nice to see the iMac get ""Center Stage"" like the new iPad Pro, a feature that automatically adjusts the camera to keep you in frame during video calls.
The iMac may not be loud and enveloping enough to replace a dedicated speaker, but it does a heck of a good job for a computer. Music sounds loud, clear, and crisp, especially when  sitting right in front of it as intended. It doesn't have as much bass as a standalone speaker like the fourth-generation Amazon Echo, and it also doesn't fill a room with sound as well. But the audio quality is still sure to please anyone looking to use their computer for video calls, watching movies, and casual music listening.
Yes, the iMac's fast performance, attractive design, and excellent webcam make it a great choice for Apple fans in search of an all-in-one desktop. 
However, you can definitely find more flexibility in terms of pricing, input options, and configurations if you look elsewhere. 
If you aren't partial to Apple, HP's Pavilion 24 has a similarly-sized screen (although it has a lower 1080p resolution) and is less expensive than the iMac. The $1,000 model comes with 16GB of RAM instead of the iMac's 8GB of memory, several USB ports (both Type-A and Type-C), HDMI input and output, and a card reader. The $1,300 iMac configuration, by comparison, only includes two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports.
Although the M1 chip packs plenty of performance, those looking for more power, screen space, memory, and storage should opt for the 27-inch iMac. You'll get the option to configure up to 128GB of memory and 8TB of storage, while the 24-inch version maxes out at 16GB of memory and 2TB of storage. This larger model also runs on Intel's chips versus Apple's, but it's configurable up to the top-of-the-line Core i9 variant. 
The new iMac is an excellent all-in-one computer for anyone looking to upgrade their home office setup. Its excellent webcam and speakers make me wish I had this throughout the whole lockdown of 2020, when I spent every weekend socializing over Zoom. 
Pros: Attractive design, great performance, excellent webcam and speakers
Cons: Only two ports on base model, lacks the iPad's ""Center Stage"" feature for video calls, Touch ID costs extra

How to use Spotify on your Apple Watch to play music or control playback,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/streaming/spotify-apple-watch,"Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Spotify has apps on nearly every internet-connected device. This includes the Apple Watch, which lets you listen to music right on your wrist.
Here's how to get Spotify on your Apple Watch, and use it to listen to music.
Before anything, make sure that Spotify is downloaded on your iPhone, and that you're logged in.
1. Open the Watch app on your iPhone.
2. Under the ""Installed on Apple Watch"" heading in the My Watch section, make sure that Spotify is there.
3. If it's not, you can install it by scrolling down to ""Available Apps"" and tapping on the ""Install"" button that appears to the right of Spotify.
Once Spotify is installed on your watch, you can launch it at any time by tapping the app's icon on your Apple Watch's home screen. In addition, playing music from the Spotify app on your iPhone will usually auto-launch it on your Watch.
By default, you'll see the title and artist of whatever song you're listening to and the player controls, but you can swipe left or right to browse your playlists or individual songs, respectively.
Anything you play will start playing on your iPhone. You can press the devices icon underneath the player controls to pick another device to stream on — including your Apple Watch if you have headphones connected. You can't play music through your Apple Watch's speakers.
Quick tip: You can connect Bluetooth headphones to your Apple Watch by opening the Settings app on the Watch, and then selecting ""Bluetooth.""
There's also no way to play Spotify on your Apple Watch offline. You can play it while you're away from your iPhone, but you'll still need to be connected to Wi-Fi or LTE internet.

Googlers fight to stay home and Apple goes to court,https://www.businessinsider.com/googlers-fight-to-stay-home-apple-epic-go-to-court-2021-4,"Sat, 01 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Hello, and welcome to this week's edition of the Insider Tech newsletter, where we break down the biggest news in tech, including:

We've seen tech worker revolts about everything from toxic corporate cultures to sexual misconduct to workplace clampdowns on political speech. Now, some Google employees are up in arms about a new hot-button issue: remote work. 
Google employees are due back in the office in September, and many are not happy about it. Some are even threatening to quit if they're not allowed to permanently work from home, as Hugh Langley reports:
While tech firms such as Microsoft and Twitter have announced plans to allow employees to work from home permanently, Google has resisted going fully remote, and employees said there's an increasing sense of frustration among a faction of the workforce.
Over the past few months, CEO Sundar Pichai has made other hints that Google is considering a flexible setup when employees return. Since then, questions about remote work have been continually put to leadership, said employees and internal materials viewed by Insider.
""Almost every TGIF or area all-hands, the question gets asked,"" one employee said.
It's an interesting turn of events for a company so instrumental in creating Silicon Valley's cushy workplace trend, where campuses brim with free-to-eat restaurants, laundry service, volleyball courts and massage therapists. 
As we learned in Google's blowout Q1 results, having employees work from home saves a lot of money. Google reduced its spending on travel, entertainment and other expenses by $268 million in Q1 as a result of COVID-19. 
And while Google's interactions with employees about the future workplace has been bumpy, the company is apparently on the ball when it comes to the technical aspects of a hybrid workforce.
Remote workers of the world, unite ... or be shackled to Google's customizable hot desk. 
It's been a busy and eventful couple of weeks for Apple — and things aren't likely to slow down anytime soon.
But the main event kicks off this coming week, when the antitrust trial between Apple and ""Fortnite""-maker Epic Games kicks off over Apple's App Store policies, particularly the 15% to 30% cut that Apple takes from sales on its platform.
Camouflage a la Zuck: Remember the photo that went viral this summer of Mark Zuckerberg riding an electric surfboard with his face covered in white sunscreen? Well, now we know the story behind the photo. Zuck purposefully — and it seems misguidedly — smeared the sunscreen all over his face in an effort to throw off a nearby paparazzi.
Too hot to handle: It took 80 firefighters more than three hours to control a blaze at the Montreal home of Pornhub founder Feras Antoon. The home was under construction and no one was injured, but authorities suspect arson. Two people were seen on the $20 million property shortly before the blaze.

Apple vs. Epic Games: 5 most interesting secrets revealed in filings,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-fortnite-epic-games-lawsuit-secrets-revealed-2021-5,"Sat, 08 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple and the maker of ""Fortnite"" are currently at war in a California courtroom — the culmination of a yearlong spat between the two American business giants.
Epic Games filed suit against Apple last summer after its hit game, ""Fortnite,"" was pulled from Apple's App Store. 
Apple says it pulled the game because Epic violated the terms of its developer agreement when Epic implemented a payment system in the game that enabled players to circumvent Apple's App Store. Epic says the App Store is a monopoly, and argues that iPhones and iPads are no different from computers.
The in-person trial began Monday at the US District Court for the Northern District of California in Oakland, California. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers is scheduled to oversee approximately three weeks of hearings before a verdict is rendered, according to court filings.
After just one week, we've already learned a lot: Between major financial disclosures, company secrets, and private emails between executives made public, evidence in the trial is a treasure trove of information.
After nearly two decades of sales, Xbox consoles have never been a profitable product for Microsoft.
The Washington-based tech giant sells every Xbox at a loss, according to sworn testimony from Microsoft's VP of Xbox business development Lori Wright.
""Has Microsoft ever earned a profit on the sale of an Xbox console?"" she was asked on Wednesday, May 5. ""No,"" she said.
Wright appeared as a witness in the ongoing trial, where she answered a variety of questions about Microsoft, Xbox, and digital storefronts. Microsoft has openly supported Epic's suit against Apple. 
The subject of Xbox profitability came up in questioning because of how Microsoft's console business works: Instead of making money on the console itself, the company makes money from games sales through its digital storefront, from subscription services like Xbox Game Pass, and from sales of accessories like gamepads.
Microsoft, like other console makers, takes a cut of every sale on its digital storefront. That cut is usually about 30%, which has become a standard in the video game distribution market. Apple takes a similar cut from games sold on its iOS App Store, which is part of what Epic is contesting in its court case against Apple.
One of Epic's expert witnesses, Berkeley Research Group managing director Ned Barnes, said that Apple is enjoying enormous margins on the App Store: In the high 70s for the last two years at least, according to Barnes. 
""In my expert report dated February 16, 2021,"" Barnes writes, ""using Apple testimony and financial information available to me at that time, I calculated the App Store's operating margin percentage to be 79.6% for each of FY2019 and FY2018.""
He also said that Apple ""produced additional documents"" for the trial that demonstrate slightly lower percentages for the two years, but that the numbers are ""consistent with and confirm the reasonableness of the calculations presented in my expert report."" 
Apple, however, disputes Barnes' report. ""Epic's experts calculations of the operating margins for the App Store are simply wrong,"" an Apple representative told The Verge.
Core to Epic's argument in the trial is that Apple operates a monopoly with the App Store by refusing to allow competing app stores on the iOS platform, in addition to not allowing third-party payment systems. High profit margins from the App Store, Epic argued, is part of the reason for Apple won't allow either.
In one of the less surprising secrets unearthed from evidence presented during the trial, ""Fortnite"" is making a huge amount of money — to the tune of several billion dollars every year for the last several years.
In 2020 alone, Epic made over $5 billion in revenue according to sworn testimony from Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney. Between 2018 and 2019, ""Fortnite"" brought in over $9 billion.
Epic makes more than ""Fortnite"" — the gaming giant produces the Unreal Engine, operates the Epic Games Store, and owns and publishes several other big games (""Rocket League"" and ""Fall Guys""). Data from Epic presented during the trial shows that those projects, while moneymakers in the hundreds of millions, don't generate anywhere near as much revenue as ""Fortnite.""
At 2 a.m. PT on August 13, 2020, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney sent an email to Apple CEO Tim Cook and several other Apple executives that laid out Epic's plan to cut Apple out of payments in ""Fortnite"" on iPhone and iPad.
It was intended as a declaration of war.
""I'm writing to tell you that Epic will no longer adhere to Apple's payment processing restrictions,"" Sweeney wrote. ""Today, Epic is launching Epic direct payments in 'Fortnite' on iOS, offering customers the choice of paying in-app through Epic direct payments or through Apple payments, and passing on the savings of Epic direct payments to customers in the form of lower prices.""
In response, Apple pulled ""Fortnite"" from its iPhone and iPad store, and the game has been unplayable on both ever since. Epic sued Apple on the same day, and this email was one of many private messages between the companies that was uncovered as evidence.
In September 2018, after months spent fighting a losing battle in the court of public opinion, Sony gave in: ""Fortnite,"" the company announced, would be playable on the PlayStation 4 with friends on other platforms. 
""Fortnite"" was the first-ever game to allow players on all platforms to play together. ""This represents a major policy change for Sony Interactive Entertainment,"" Sony said in its announcement. It was clear at the time that, with the game playable across all other platforms, Sony was almost certain to give in: Tens of millions of people were playing ""Fortnite,"" and they were earning the most from players on Sony's PlayStation 4, according to documents from Epic presented as evidence in the trial.
Between January 2019 and July 2020, just before ""Fortnite"" was removed from the App Store, Epic was earning just shy of $150 million each month on average from PlayStation players, according to Epic. By comparison, the company was earning about $23 million per month on average from iOS players, Epic said.

"Apple iPad Pro 2021 (M1) Review: Faster Performance, Great Cameras",https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/apple-ipad-pro-review-m1-2021,"Wed, 19 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more

The iPad Pro has always been Apple's most powerful tablet, but the company is taking that approach to the next level with its latest model. 
The new iPad Pro, which launches in the second half of May and starts at $800 for the 11-inch model, runs on Apple's M1 chip, the same powerful processor found inside the latest MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.
Compared to last year's version, the 11-inch iPad Pro I've been testing also comes with optional 5G connectivity, a better webcam with Apple's new Center Stage feature, Thunderbolt support, and choices for more storage capacity. 
All told, the addition of the M1 chip along with these improvements makes the iPad faster, longer-lasting, and more useful as a work device than before. Yet it still has limitations that prevent it from truly replacing your laptop, so it's better-suited for creatives rather than those with more traditional workflows. 
Still, for creative professionals, the M1 chip is likely to open up a whole new set of possibilities. But as is the case with Apple's older iPad Pros, you'll have to pay a pretty penny to get the most out of it.
The 11-inch iPad Pro comes with a vibrant screen that packs 264 pixels per inch, just like the iPad Air, 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and previous-generation iPad Pro. Apple's new mini-LED display, which should enable better contrast, is only available on the latest larger-sized iPad Pro. 
The biggest differences between the screens on the 11-inch iPad Pro and iPad Air is that the Pro's display is slightly larger, brighter, and includes Apple's ProMotion technology. This boosts the refresh rate up to 120Hz for smoother scrolling and faster responsiveness. 
But it isn't noticeable enough to play a big role in your buying decision. Scrolling seems a bit faster, but using the second-generation Apple Pencil to sketch and color on the iPad Air generally feels as smooth as it does on the new iPad Pro. 
The new iPad Pro also has the same slim design as its predecessor. That's to say it has a sleek metal build with flat edges, making it extremely compact and portable. But unlike the colorful iPad Air, the iPad Pro only comes in silver and space gray.
The iPad Pro's M1 chip is impressively fast when it comes to processing video and photo edits. That's important for a device like this, which Apple has been pitching towards photographers, video editors, artists, designers, architects, and really anyone who works with 3D renderings.
In one test, the M1-equipped iPad Pro exported a 10-minute 4K video to 1080p using Adobe Premiere Rush in nearly half the amount of time it took for the iPad Air to accomplish the same task. It also beat last year's 12.9-inch iPad Pro by about 20 seconds. Exporting the same video on a Dell XPS 13 running on an 11th-generation Intel Core i7 chip took nearly 20 minutes.
The new iPad Pro was also a hair faster at exporting a 4.7MB photo using Adobe Lightroom, as shown in the results below.
The jump in speed compared to Apple's older iPads is certainly notable. But it's really the way app developers put the M1 chip's power to use in their apps that will make the iPad Pro stand out. For example, the music composition app StaffPad is updating its app with a feature only available on M1 devices that automatically detects notes as you're playing an instrument.
It's features like this that showcase Apple's intentions for the iPad Pro as a computing device. Although I've always appreciated the iPad Pro for its speed, battery life, and compact design, I've never really understood Apple's vision for it as a new type of computer. That seems poised to change now that the M1 chip has made its way to the iPad Pro, as apps like StaffPad are proving.
But don't get the iPad Pro if you're really looking for a traditional laptop experience. Computers that run on a desktop operating system like macOS or Windows are still much easier to navigate for juggling multiple workflows. 
I'm able to get most of my work done (including writing this review) on the iPad Pro by displaying Google Docs and Slack in Split View and keeping my email handy in Slide Over. 
However, the minute I need to dig into another app or open a different Google Doc, I find myself missing my laptop. And if you really want to use the iPad to get work done, you'll have to purchase accessories since Apple doesn't include a keyboard or Apple Pencil in the box. That means the iPad Pro can get expensive pretty quickly, considering the newest Apple Pencil costs $129 and the Magic Keyboard starts at $299.
That being said, Apple has addressed one of the iPad Pro's biggest shortcomings compared to a traditional computer. Both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch models now support Thunderbolt, making it possible to connect the iPad to more peripherals, like high-resolution displays, USB-C hubs, and directly to dedicated cameras.
Cameras have traditionally been overlooked in tablets, but that's not the case with the iPad Pro. Like its predecessor, Apple's latest pro-tablet has a LiDAR sensor for measuring depth, a 12-megapixel wide camera, and a 10-megapixel ultra-wide angle camera, which could be useful for those who want to quickly shoot and edit photos and videos on the same device.
But it's the front-facing camera that's gotten a big improvement this time around. Not only does the new iPad Pro have a 12-megapixel front camera instead of a 7-megapixel camera, but it also has a new feature called Center Stage. 
As the name implies, Center Stage keeps you in frame as you move during video calls, and it works in Apple's FaceTime app as well as other video conference apps. 
Center Stage just works on the new iPad Pro, so you don't have to toggle any settings to enable it. During FaceTime calls, the camera automatically zooms in slowly to frame my face more evenly and follows me as I slide over to the left and right. It even pans out when someone else enters the scene to get them in the shot.
Some other devices like Amazon's newest Echo Show 10 and Logitech's QuickCam webcam use motors to track subjects and keep them in frame, but having it built right into the iPad makes it feel more useful and ubiquitous. 
This is an example of a feature that really makes the iPad Pro stand out in Apple's tablet lineup. It also shows how Apple can leverage the M1's power to add capabilities that weren't possible before. I only wish it came sooner, as I could imagine it being really useful for the group video calls I made to friends and family over the holidays in 2020. Hopefully this feature comes to M1 Macs at some point, too.
Otherwise, the 12-megapixel front camera on the new iPad Pro has also gotten a boost in overall quality. Take a look at the photos below, and you'll notice the iPad Pro's image looks slightly brighter and more colorful than the photo taken on the iPad Air, which has a 7-megapixel front camera.
Apple estimates that the new iPad Pro should have the same battery life as the previous-generation iPad Pro and newest iPad Air. Battery life is generally similar between all three tablets based on my testing, but the new 11-inch iPad Pro lasted the longest. When I played a 1080p video on YouTube with the screen set at its maximum brightness, the new 11-inch iPad Pro lasted for almost six hours. 
The iPad Air, meanwhile, died after a little more than five hours, while the older 12.9-inch iPad Pro died at the five hour mark. Remember, however, that battery life will vary depending on how you use your iPad. It's also possible that the 11-inch iPad Pro lasted longer because it's brand new, whereas the iPad Air and iPad Pro have been used previously for other tests and reviews.
Yes, but only if you're looking for a tablet for editing multimedia projects and making video calls. The iPad Air can handle most of the same tasks for a cheaper price, but creatives who really want a super portable work device are likely to benefit most from the iPad Pro's M1 processor, Thunderbolt support, and advanced cameras.
If you're looking to spend around $1,000 for a work device and have a more traditional workflow that involves doing a lot of research in a web browser, managing spreadsheets, and writing papers, the MacBook Air is a better choice. It still offers the long battery life and fast performance that comes with the M1 chip, but runs on Apple's desktop software that's better for multitasking.
Those who want a really nice iPad for light productivity, playing games, and watching movies should opt for the iPad Air, which has a similar design, plenty of power since it runs on the same chip as the iPhone 12, and is also compatible with the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard.
If you really want a tablet for traditional workflows and aren't partial to Apple, there's always Microsoft's Surface Pro 7. The Surface Pro 7 has a similarly compact and ultra-portable design, but runs on Windows instead of a mobile-first operating system. 
The new iPad Pro is fast, long-lasting, and has an impressive camera that keeps you in frame. But it's expensive, making it only really worth it for creative professionals that need top-notch performance and portability for working with large video and photo files in small offices or on the go. 
Pros: Great selfie camera that keeps you in frame, fast performance, long battery life
Cons: Gets expensive quickly when you add accessories, multitasking is still better on a desktop operating system

Apple employees ask Tim Cook to publicly support Palestinians: report,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-employees-ask-tim-cook-to-publicly-support-palestinians-report-2021-5,"Thu, 20 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Nearly 1,000 Apple employees have signed an internal letter to CEO Tim Cook urging the company to issue a public statement in support of the Palestinian people, The Verge reported Thursday.
""We are frustrated and disappointed because once more, many of those in positions of power and influence — who boldly stand for human rights in so many other just causes — either choose to remain silent or release ineffectually neutral 'both sides' statements with regards to the Palestinian situation,"" wrote the letter's authors, who are members of the Apple Muslim Association, according to The Verge.
Apple taking a ""both sides"" approach, they wrote, ""would feel to us as the equivalent of 'all lives matter' — a minimization of the disproportionately larger pain and suffering of the Palestinian people.""
Apple did not respond to a request for comment on this story.
The letter follows a wave of violence in Gaza, where Israeli military forces have killed at least 232 Palestinians, including 65 children and 39 women, and the militant group Hamas has killed around a dozen Israelis.
On Thursday, Israel and Hamas announced a ceasefire.
International human rights organizations have condemned Israel's attacks as possible war crimes, and have denounced its treatment of Palestinians as a form of apartheid. More recently, Israel's effort to push Palestinians out of East Jerusalem, and an Israeli police raid on Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites, have escalated tensions.
The letter to Cook is the second high-profile instance of a large number of Apple employees criticizing the company over ethical concerns in the past week alone — a rare occurrence at Apple.
Last week, The Verge reported more than 2,000 employees signed a letter slamming Apple for hiring Antonio García Martínez, citing ""misogynistic"" and racist past comments. Hours later, Apple said García Martínez had left the company (García Martínez claimed Apple fired him).

"Apple just made a major hire on its ad-platforms team, and it's the latest sign of the company's growing advertising ambitions",https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-hires-chaos-monkeys-author-ex-facebook-antonio-garcia-martinez-2021-5,"Mon, 10 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple recently hired Antonio García Martínez, a former Facebook ads-product manager and the author of ""Chaos Monkeys,"" to join its product-engineering team for ad platforms, another sign of the technology giant's growing ambitions in the advertising space.
García Martínez joined Apple in April and will work out of Cupertino, California, according to his LinkedIn profile. Apple's ad-platforms team works on the technology that powers ads within the App Store and the Apple News and Stocks apps.
Apple didn't respond to requests for comment. García Martínez declined to comment.
García Martínez, who worked at Facebook between 2011 and 2013, was an influential figure on the social network's early ad-product team. He first focused on its ad-targeting efforts before becoming the product manager on FBX, Facebook's now defunct ad exchange for real-time bidding. He published ""Chaos Monkeys"" in 2016, a tell-all memoir covering his time at the company. García Martínez has since gone on to hold roles at the adtech company Nanigans and the mobile-measurement firm Branch. He's also served as an advisor to Twitter.
The hire marks the latest move suggesting Apple is looking to ramp up its relatively small ads division once again. In 2016 the company killed off its iAd ad network, Apple's boldest advertising effort to date that launched with big ambitions but failed to gain a real footing in the highly competitive mobile-ad market.
Last month, the company introduced a big privacy change in the latest update for its iPhone operating system, dubbed App Tracking Transparency. Developers now need to gain permission from users to track them across other websites and apps for advertising purposes.
So far, user opt-in rates have been low, and advertisers have said the new rules make it trickier to precision-target users and measure the effectiveness of their ad campaigns.
Last year, analysts at Arete Research estimated the privacy change could wipe out $40 billion in mobile-app ad spending and affect tech giants including Facebook, Snap, and Twitter, as well as games developers and publishers.
Some ad-industry observers have said the change could boost Apple's fledgling ads business as advertisers look to new methods beyond in-app advertising to increase awareness of their apps among users. Toni Sacconaghi, a Bernstein analyst, made a ""conservative"" estimate in 2018 that Apple's App Store ads could be a $2 billion business by 2020; Apple recorded revenue of $274 billion for its 2020 financial year.
Perhaps not coincidentally, Apple last week launched a new ad format called ""Search tab campaigns,"" a unit that sits atop the list of ""suggested apps"" when a user visits the search section of the App Store.
Charlie Curtis, a managing director at the UK digital-media-specialist recruitment agency Moriati Media, said Apple had been ramping up its search for advertising experts since about the third quarter of 2018.
A search for ""ad platforms"" on Apple's careers site brought up 53 results for roles around the globe, including product managers, search-platform specialists, software engineers, and a legal counsel. One recent job listing also suggests Apple is building a new team within the ad-platforms engineering unit that will be focused on protecting against fraudulent traffic.
""They are throwing a lot of money around and paying way above the market rate,"" Curtis said. ""There's a rigorous interview process, and they pay what it takes to get talented people.""
While Apple's advertising advancements might have the effect of siphoning away some ad dollars from the likes of Google and Facebook, Bill Wise, the CEO of the ad-software company Mediaocean, said Apple was likely to take a markedly different — and less data-hungry — approach from the so-called digital-advertising duopoly.
""I actually don't think Apple is gearing up to be a major player in the ad market,"" Wise said. ""I think there's a separate approach more around regulating and worrying about privacy — and nobody is better at understanding the first-party and third-party data ecosystem than adtech people.""
Indeed, a recent job description for an engineering role on the ad-platforms team describes how the company is ""setting new standards for enabling effective advertising while protecting user privacy.""

Apple's privacy change fallout;
Air Mail seeks $15 million;
Bezos' TV rules.
First, if you got this newsletter forwarded, sign up for your own here.

It's been just over a couple weeks since Apple rolled out its new privacy-focused changes, and it's already resulting in user opt-in rates, falling ad prices, and increased opacity around advertising measurement as a result, Lara O'Reilly and Tanya Dua reported.
And the worst may be to come, as it's still very early in Apple's rollout of the changes.
Some ad-industry observers have said the change could boost Apple's fledgling ads business — and indeed, Apple just launched a new ad format that users see when they visit the search section of the App Store.
Probably just a coincidence, right?

As Apple tightens the screws on ad tracking, it's preparing a new ad format of its own. People briefed on the plans reveal its pricing model and targeting options.
Apple just made a major hire on its ad-platforms team, and it's the latest sign of the company's growing advertising ambitions
Steven Perlberg caught up with famed editor Graydon Carter, who's out raising more money for his 2-year-old newsletter Air Mail. 
Carter outlined his plans for the company, including Italian and French language editions, cafés, and high-end Air Mail-branded merchandise. He also embraced comparisons with the glossy magazines of bygone days:
I don't think that most online publications look great. People care about design. They care about it in their homes, their cars, their clothes, and I think they care about it in the things they read. It's why a lot of attention is put into book cover design.
We fact check and copy edit Air Mail as closely as we did Vanity Fair, and that's rare on the internet. A couple of things I've read on Substack, I thought, ""Oh my God, this person needs an editor."" Editors serve very little function in this world, but they do tend to create order out of chaos.
One of the juicy tidbits in Brad Stone's new book ""Amazon Unbound: Jeff Bezos and the Invention of a Global Empire"" was that Bezos was so involved in Amazon Studios' projects that he had 12 elements that each TV show had to have, including ""a heroic protagonist who experiences growth and change"" and ""moral choices.""
Amazon Studios execs had to send Bezos regular updates on projects in development, and if they didn't follow the 12 rules, explain why they didn't.
Bezos eventually stopped micromanaging, and is stepping into an executive chairman role this summer, but the company is still betting on big, genre-focused entertainment projects.

Thanks for reading, and see you next week!

"Apple Stores Data on Chinese Servers, Censors Apps for CCP: Report",https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-data-china-censors-apps-nyt-2021-5,"Mon, 17 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple has increasingly bowed to China's demands as it relies more heavily on its supply chain, which it began building in the nation two decades ago, according to a revealing report from the New York Times' Jack Nicas, Raymond Zhong, and Daisuke Wakabayashi.
The Times spoke with 17 current and former Apple employees who gave details about how the company has catered to China.
Per those sources, CEO Tim Cook green-lit using servers run by Chinese state-owned companies to store customer data. China also reportedly wouldn't accept Apple's use of encryption technology that it typically uses in its data server centers, so the company agreed to abandon it.
That made it easy for authorities to siphon sensitive information from millions of Chinese citizens such as emails, photos, and locations, security experts told the outlet. Such sharing of sensitive information is illegal by US law, as the Times notes.
The tech giant has also complied with the Communist Party's demands to censor about 55,000 apps from its App Store since 2017 that authorities deemed to be harmful to the government's values, sources told the Times.

Apple employees were tasked with flagging apps that company management perceived would anger the Chinese government, per the report. Topics on those apps that would get flagged include the Dalai Lama and independence for Taiwan, which China argues is a province of the nation. Some apps related to gay dating services and foreign news organizations also disappeared from the store.
A critic of the Communist Party, Guo Wengui, was also a banned topic on Apple's Chinese App Store, according to internal communications viewed by the Times. An Apple reviewer that approved an app associated with him was fired after Chinese officials contacted the company. Apple said it fired the employee due to poor work performance.
When reached for comment, a representative for Apple pointed Insider to Nicas' tweet featuring the company's full statement made to the Times. 
It told the publication that it follows Chinese laws and has ""never comprised the security of our users or their data in China or anywhere we operate."" Apple also told the publication that it only removed apps from its Chinese app store to abide by China's laws.
""These decisions are not always easy, and we may not agree with the laws that shape them,"" Apple said in the statement. ""But our priority remains creating the best user experience without violating the rules we are obligated to follow.""
China is a lucrative market for Apple, with a fifth of the company's sales coming from the country. Much of the company's products are assembled in the nation — Apple had the fifth-largest smartphone unit shipment in Q1, according to a 2021 report from the market research firm Canalys.
As the NYT notes, Cook has routinely stated his dedication to human and civil rights, even as reports surface detailing connections between Apple's Chinese suppliers and forced human labor.
The Information reported last week that seven of apple's suppliers in China were found to be linked to suspected forced labor of Uyghur Muslims and other persecuted groups from the Xinjiang region. Apple has previously denied using suppliers that relied upon forced Uyghur labor.

The new Beats Studio Buds outshine the standard AirPods in 2 key ways — and they also work with Android phones,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/apple-beats-studio-buds-review,"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission.

For years, AirPods have had a key advantage for iPhone owners over rival earbuds: their ability to initiate the pairing process as soon as you open the lid. 
Now, Apple is hoping to bring that same appeal to a broader audience with the new $150 Beats Studio Buds, launching on June 24. These new earbuds are capable of starting the pairing process as soon as you flick open their lid and press the pairing button, regardless of whether you're on iPhone or Android. They're also the first Beats headphones to work with the Android Find My Device service for locating lost gadgets.
But these aren't the main reasons you should consider buying these headphones. The Beats Studio Buds still work better with the iPhone overall despite these new benefits for Android owners. It's really their excellent sound quality and comfortable fit for the price that makes the Studio Buds stand out. For iPhone users, they're also a compelling alternative to the standard $159 AirPods.
The Beats Studio Buds are among the most comfortable earbuds I've ever worn. They easily glide right into my ears and stay firmly in place even while running or exercising. Comfort can be subjective, most wireless earbuds — even the AirPods Pro — tend to feel a little loose while running.
The Studio Buds have a distinguished design that almost resembles a fatter AirPod Pro with no stems. I also love that the Beats logo doubles as a button for playback controls, which feels a lot more responsive than the buttonless touch sensors on most wireless earbuds.
The medium-sized ear tips that come in the box fit alright, but once I switched to the small tips I noticed a tremendous difference in comfort and sound quality. It's well worth taking the time to try on all three of the included ear tips to see which one fits best. 
But Beats doesn't include as much choice as other headphones, even when compared to the less expensive $120 Amazon Echo Buds. You only get three tips in the box, whereas Amazon includes four ear tips and two wing tips for extra security. There's also no ear fit tip test with the Beats Studio Buds as there is with Amazon's Echo Buds and the AirPods Pro, so you'll have to evaluate the fit based on how they feel.  
Getting started with the Beats Studio Buds on the iPhone is essentially identical to the AirPods setup process. Just open the case, hold down the pairing button, and a prompt showing the Beats Studio Buds appears on screen within a few seconds. 
The process is similar on Android and doesn't require any app installation. That's a big deal because most wireless earbuds other than AirPods either require that you install an app or navigate to the device's Bluetooth menu when pairing them for the first time. 
But setting up the Beats Studio Buds with an Android device only requires that you open the lid, hold down the pairing button, and tap the on-screen prompt. There's also a link to download the Beats app for Android directly in the prompt so you don't have to search for it in the Google Play Store.
But the initial pairing process still feels faster on the iPhone compared to Android, as I noticed my iPhone 12 detected the Beats Studio Buds almost instantly whereas there was a delay on devices like the Samsung Galaxy A52 and Pixel 5. This improved a bit after installing a software update on the Galaxy A52, but the iPhone experience still felt more responsive overall.
The app itself is very basic, but it highlights one of the ways in which the iOS experience is still superior to Android, despite the fact that the Beats Studio Buds are designed to work with both operating systems. 
The Beats app for Android is where you're able to perform tasks like customizing the earbuds' touch controls or toggling between active noise cancellation and Transparency Mode from your phone. You don't need an app to switch between noise cancellation and Transparency on iOS via your phone since these options are built right into the Control Center, just as they are with AirPods. 
The Beats Studio Buds offer solid, well-balanced sound for $150 earbuds. Music sounds loud, crisp, and full-bodied across genres, whether I'm listening to pop, rock, classical, or hip hop. The audio is also generally balanced so that you can hear all the elements of a song clearly without them blending together too much.
Don't expect as much bass, volume, or richness as what you'd get with pricier earbuds like the  AirPods Pro and Sony WF-1000XM3. But the Studio Buds still sound louder and more vibrant than the $120 Amazon Echo Buds in most situations and are about on-par with Apple's $159 standard AirPods. 
The Beats Studio Buds also support spatial audio for songs in Apple Music that are mixed in Dolby Atmos, which gives music more depth and makes it sound like the audio is coming from multiple directions. They do not, however, support the AirPod Pro's dynamic head tracking capabilities. 
What really makes the Beats Studio Buds excel over the similarly priced regular AirPods is their support for noise cancellation and Transparency Mode.
Wireless earbuds generally aren't capable of blocking out sound as well as over-ear headphones since they don't cover your ears by design. But they do make it easier to focus on the music or podcast you're listening to in loud environments without cranking up the volume, and that's exactly what the Beats Studio Buds do well. 
I tested this by setting the TV to a high volume while listening to music streaming from my phone through the Beats Studio Buds. The TV was certainly audible with noise cancellation turned on, but the voices on shows like ""Bob's Burgers"" and ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" felt softer and more like background noise. Without noise cancellation, these voices were much more distracting and were just as loud as the music.
The Beats Studio Buds were slightly better than the Echo Buds at making music feel more prominent than the TV blaring in the background, but not quite as good as the AirPods Pro. 
The standard $159 AirPods, which lack noise cancellation, are still surprisingly good at drowning out sound since they typically sound louder than the Beats Studio Buds. The key difference is that the Studio Buds make voices coming from the TV sound softer and less harsh, keeping the focus on the music.
The Beats Studio Buds come with the standard selection of convenient features found on AirPods and many other wireless earbuds. These include auto pausing when an earbud is placed in its case, instant pairing, and Find My support. 
However, they don't support wireless charging or some of the newer features found on iPhone-compatible earbuds that run on Apple's H1 chips. These include the ability to share audio with others and have Siri announce notifications and messages. But these Siri features could be on the table for a future software update, Beats said. 
Those using the Beats Studio Buds with an iPhone can still access Siri hands-free. But all other voice assistants can only be triggered using touch controls — another example of how these headphones work better with iPhones.
That being said, Apple's ""Hey Siri"" feature works well on the Studio Buds; the microphones easily pick up my voice even when I'm blaring music through the buds.
Don't worry about having to plug in the Beats Studio Buds very often. It's been a little more than a full day since I've unplugged the case, and it's still at 80% percent. 
Beats claims the earbuds should last for eight hours on a single charge and achieve 24 hours of total listening time through the case with active noise cancellation turned off. That drops down to five hours on a single charge and 15 hours total listening time with active noise cancellation turned on.
Yes, the Beats Studio Buds are relatively affordable wireless earbuds that have plenty to offer for $150. They have a comfortable and secure fit, decent sound quality that's appropriate for the price, water resistance, and cross compatibility with iOS and Android.
Apple's $249 AirPods Pro offer better noise cancellation, superior audio quality, extra features like dynamic head tracking for spatial audio, and wireless charging. They're a better choice for those who are devoted to Apple's iPhone ecosystem and want the best possible audio without sacrificing convenience.
The Beats Studio Buds provide little incentive to opt for Apple's $159 AirPods unless features like audio sharing and message announcements from Siri are a dealbreaker. 
Those looking for earbuds that are around the same price and also work across iOS and Android should consider the $120 Echo Buds. They're a bit cheaper and don't sound quite as good, but they come with some extras that Echo device owners will appreciate, like the ability to call Echo devices and hands-free Alexa access. 
With solid audio quality, noise cancellation, and a comfortable fit, the $150 Beats Studio Buds have a lot to offer for the price. The iPhone experience is still better in some respects, but Android owners will still be happy with the snug fit and great sound. 
Pros: Comfortable fit, solid audio quality, affordable price
Cons: No hands-free voice assistant on Android, no wireless charging

"Cellebrite CEO talks private sector, Apple patches, Signal",https://www.businessinsider.com/cellebrite-ceo-going-public-apple-samsung-private-sector-moxie-marlinspike-2021-6,"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"For most of the 22 years since its founding, the digital forensics firm Cellebrite has kept a low profile. But now, the phone-cracking firm is stepping out of the shadows as it prepares to go public.
The Israel-based company made a name for itself with software that lets its customers — mostly police departments — break into locked smartphones to carry out investigations. The firm's technology was reportedly used by the FBI to unlock the San Bernadino shooter's iPhone, even after Apple said it couldn't help the agency break in. But the company has kept details of its business and technology under wraps until now.
In an interview with Insider this week, Cellebrite CEO Yossi Carmil and other execs opened up about the firm's phone-cracking technology and its digital arms race against vendors like Apple and Samsung. Carmil also described Cellebrite's recent expansion into private enterprise customers, and hit back at vocal critics of the company like the founder of encrypted messaging app Signal, Moxie Marlinspike, a privacy advocate who called Cellebrite's technology ""larcenous.""
Carmil, meanwhile, dismissed Marlinspike as ""one of the anti-forensics, which are as old as the forensics industry.""
Cellebrite's stated mission is is to ""protect and save lives, accelerate justice, and ensure data privacy,"" but it's faced criticism from privacy hardliners and criminal justice advocates, who argue it's unfair to the subjects of investigations that their data can be seized by law enforcement using technology that's largely opaque. Critics have also slammed the company for licensing technology to authoritarian governments, a practice Cellebrite has recently taken steps to curtail.  
Despite the criticism, Cellebrite is confident that its business will grow steadily in the years to come. The firm announced this week that it has achieved annual recurring revenue of $150 million, up 53% from the year prior. Its clients include police departments in all 50 US states, national law enforcement agencies in 25 of the 27 European Union nations, and 8 out of the 10 largest US banks. Now, it has big plans to expand into the private sector as it prepares to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) by the end of 2021, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion.
""The company is executing a strategy with a goal to become a one-stop-shop vendor in the digital intelligence space,"" Carmil said. ""I think we are not even scratching the surface of what the company can be.""
The firm has expanded its services in recent years: It recently launched a data analytics tool to supplement its encryption-breaking technology, and now offers a single software platform meant to be used by investigators, analysts, and prosecutors alike.
Cellebrite licenses a suite of products that collect and manage data from digital sources, but its most well-known offering is a physical analyzer that promises customers the ability to extract data from locked smartphones. The physical analyzer does not intercept data remotely; rather, it connects to a phone physically to break in and extract information.
That puts Cellebrite's business at odds with vendors like Apple and Samsung, which promise users privacy. Apple has previously told the US Department of Justice that even Apple engineers can't open a locked iPhone without knowing the passcode. 
According to Carmil, Apple has been trying to patch vulnerabilities that Cellebrite exploits since 2011, and Cellebrite has been in a similar cat-and-mouse game with Samsung since 2016. But Carmil said he's confident that Cellebrite will stay ahead of those efforts.
""On a strategic level, on a tactical and operational level, definitely there is a race,"" Carmil said. ""We are less concerned about the near future — three to five years — because we have enough assets and we are winning this race. And actually it's not that we are chasing after the vendor: The vendor is chasing after us.""
Carmil also speculated that companies like Apple and Samsung may ultimately determine that it's in their best interests not to fight Cellebrite's technology. He argues that Cellebrite lets law enforcement collect information without creating the expectation that vendors need to cooperate with them.
Apple has previously told prosecutors that it can't open locked phones or break iMessage's end-to-end encryption and it and other tech firms are vocally opposed to so-called ""backdoors"" for law enforcement, which they say hurt security for all users. Representatives for Apple and Samsung did not respond to requests for comment.
""I might surprise you: I think that there is a coexistence here,"" he said. ""I believe that the vendors needs companies like Cellebrite, not to mention that the law enforcement needs it as well. So I'm not that sure that there is an interest to close it automatically in the future.""
After Cellebrite boasted that its technology could extract data from the encrypted messaging app Signal, Marlinspike — Signal's founder and CEO — called the now-deleted post ""pretty embarrassing"" for the company. Then, several months later, he published a blog post in April claiming he reverse engineered Cellebrite's physical analyzer and found a vulnerability that could corrupt extracted data.
""This could even be done at random, and would seriously call the data integrity of Cellebrite's reports into question,"" Marlinspike wrote, arguing that data extracted by Cellebrite devices in the past could have been spoiled if suspects ever exploited the vulnerability. At least one defense lawyer has already used the findings to ask a judge to throw out data obtained by Cellebrite's tools, but legal experts say Marlinspike's proof-of-concept is unlikely to devalue all previous Cellebrite data in the eyes of courts. 
Carmil told Insider that Marlinspike achieved the exploit in a ""sterile lab environment"" and denied that there's evidence such an exploit has ever corrupted data extracted by Cellebrite in the real world. Nonetheless, he said the company took Marlinspike's findings ""seriously"" and updated its software to patch the vulnerability.
""Theoretically, everything is vulnerable,"" Carmil said, adding that the firm's ""relationship today with 5,000 public sector customers"" shows that ""the results speak for themself.""
Marlinspike also claimed that he found packages in Cellebrite's code signed by Apple, which appeared to be extracted from a Windows installer for iTunes, implying that Cellebrite violated Apple's copyright. While Carmil did not deny the existence of those packages, he told Insider that no copyright violation occured. 
A number of high-profile criminal cases have hinged on Cellebrite's tools. In 2015, police in Leicestershire, UK used Cellebrite to extract Facebook Messenger records from the iPad of 15-year-old Kayleigh Haywood after she disappeared, discovering evidence that led to the arrest of her suspected killer. 
At the start of 2020, roughly 90% of Cellebrite's clients were government agencies, but has also been seriously pursuing private enterprises in recent years, Carmil said. The company expects private companies to comprise 20% of its business by the end of 2023. 
""The private sector is a great opportunity,"" chief strategy officer Leeor Ben-Peretz told Insider, adding that private clients use Cellebrite for e-discovery in corporate security litigation and fraud cases. Companies are increasingly seeking out digital tools to help track down insider leaks, a growing threat to corporate secrets. 
But as the firm grows its base of enterprise clients, it's also ruling out certain government customers with track records of human rights abuses. It recently stopped selling its tech to countries like Russia, Belarus, and China after it emerged that those governments used Cellebrite tools against political dissidents.
Carmil said Cellebrite only wants to work with customers who align with its mission to ""create a safer environment,"" adding that he recently hired a chief compliance officer to ensure the company doesn't violate sanctions imposed by the US, EU, or Israel.
""Especially now as we go public, we are very motivated by what we do. We wake up in the morning to help the forces that create a safer world,"" Carmil said. ""We need to accelerate justice.""

Apple is experiencing an issue with its credit card that's preventing some users from making in-store purchases,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-card-issue-prevents-some-in-store-purchases-2021-6,"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Some users of Apple's in-house credit card may be experiencing issues as of Monday morning. 
Apple reported an issue with the card as of 3:30 a.m. Monday that is preventing some users from making in-store purchases. It appears that the issue is affecting those who use the card via Apple's digital wallet service, Apple Pay, rather than the physical credit card.
It's unclear how widespread the issue is or when it will be resolved. An Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to Insider's request for comment. 
Read more: Apple's new major iOS change lets you decide if you want brands to track you across apps. Most people are opting out, and it's already crushing advertisers.
Apple unveiled the card, its first foray into physical credit cards, in March 2019. While Apple does offer a white, titanium credit card that can be used in stores, there's also a digital version of the card that's meant to be used at merchants that accept Apple Pay. 
Apple has touted the card's lack of hidden fees or late-payment fees, as well as a rewards program that offers cardholders 2% cash back when they use Apple Pay, as well as 3% back on purchases made on the App Store or iTunes. Apple has also highlighted the card's baked-in security: it comes with multiple credit card numbers in the event your card is compromised, and the physical version of the card is free of numbers altogether.
Because the Apple Card lives entirely in a virtual wallet, it offers both simplicity and an over-dependence on your iPhone, according to reviews of the card. The Wallet app allows users to easily track their spending and pay off their balance, but it also means you're locked into the Apple ecosystem more than ever.

New Apple Wallet features in iOS 15 make it harder to leave the iPhone,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-ios-15-apple-wallet-features-harder-to-leave-iphone-2021-6,"Mon, 07 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The iPhone's appeal is about much more than just the iPhone. It's about the Apple Watch, AirPods, the Apple Card, Apple Fitness+, and the many other Apple products you probably use as an iPhone owner. 
Apple is building on that idea with its next major iPhone update, called iOS 15, which introduces new features that let you replace critical items like keys and ID cards with your iPhone. Other major additions include updates to Apple's core apps that help them better compete with third-party software like Zoom, and tighter integrations between Apple's services.
Apple announced its new iPhone operating system at its Worldwide Developer Conference alongside software upgrades to other important products like the iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac computers. 
The conference is always a critical moment for Apple, during which it showcases innovative new features for all of its major products. But it's especially important this year as the company seeks to entice developers amid its high-profile legal battle with ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games, which has accused Apple of monopolistic practices over the way it manages the App Store.
Now, with iOS 15, Apple is launching new capabilities that could make the iPhone an even more integral part of everyday life. One new feature, for example, represents a major step forward in Apple's effort to turn the iPhone into a replacement for the most essential items in our purses and pockets: our keys, ID cards, and wallets. 
Later this year, iPhone owners in the United States will be able to add their driver's license or state identification cards to Apple Wallet, the company said during the event. Apple also announced that your iPhone will be able to serve as a digital key for your home, hotel room, and office when used with compatible third-party systems. This comes after Apple previously announced efforts to turn your iPhone into a digital car key.
Apple's ambitions to enable your iPhone to serve as a digital wallet have been clear for some time. Apple CEO Tim Cook even said as much in 2014 when unveiling Apply Pay, and the company launched its own iPhone-based credit card called the Apple Card in 2019. But the new features in iOS 15 make that vision more fully realized.
If these digital key and ID card systems are widely embraced, it could make switching to Android much less compelling — or nearly impossible — for iPhone users. When I reviewed the Apple Card in 2019, one of my biggest takeaways was that it made the iPhone feel even more essential to my daily life since I found myself using Apple Pay much more often. Apple Pay had existed for years, but using it only became a daily habit when I started using the Apple Card.
Making the switch to Android would also be more cumbersome since it would mean canceling one of my credit cards. This push to move the rest of our wallet over to the iPhone seems like it has the potential to have a similar impact. 
That's not necessarily a bad thing, of course. Why would anyone want to carry around a phone, a wallet, and a key ring when all you really need is your iPhone? Still, it raises the question as to whether the convenience of lightening our pockets is worth becoming so reliant on a single device, especially at a time when lawmakers are questioning the influence and reach of companies like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google.
Apple's new Wallet features are just a few of the many changes coming to Apple's core products later this year. Another major focus of iOS 15 is the way Apple's various products and services work together — a key advantage that Apple's ecosystem has had for years. 
A new feature called ""Shared With You,"" for example, surfaces content that friends and family members have shared with you in Apple's Messages app in other corresponding apps like Music, Photos, Apple News, and Safari. 
Apple is also giving you less of a reason to turn to third-party video chatting apps like Zoom thanks to its new FaceTime update, which brings the ability to watch movies and listen to music together via FaceTime and create links for FaceTime calls that can be shared and accessed, even on non-Apple devices, through a web browser.
At the same time, Apple has made it easier to use third-party apps with its products and services in recent years. In 2020, for example, it made it possible for iPhone users to change certain app defaults to third-party apps for the first time. And with iOS 15, it's letting HomeKit accessory makers add Siri to their products for the first time.
Still, the overall message is clear: Apple's iPhone ecosystem may be more open than ever, but it's only going to get more difficult to leave it.

Apple reveals more details about Trump DOJ subpoenas of lawmakers,https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-reveals-more-details-about-trump-doj-subpoenas-of-lawmakers-2021-6,"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple on Friday revealed additional detail about subpoenas it received from the Trump administration's Department of Justice seeking data about members of the House Intelligence Committee.
Apple told TechCrunch reporter Zack Whittaker the DOJ's subpoenas sought metadata about 73 phone numbers and 36 email addresses, but that it only disclosed ""account subscriber information and did not provide any content such as emails or pictures.""
Prosecutors ultimately subpoenaed Apple for data on at least a dozen people connected to the committee,  The New York Times reported this week, but found no evidence connecting any of them to the leaks.
Apple also told TechCrunch the subpoena was issued by a federal grand jury, included a gag order signed by a federal magistrate judge, and ""provided no information on the nature of the investigation,"" making it ""virtually impossible for Apple to understand the intent of the desired information without digging through users' accounts.""
""We regularly challenge warrants, subpoenas and nondisclosure orders and have made it our policy to inform affected customers of governmental requests about them as soon as possible,"" Apple added, implying the gag order prevented it from informing lawmakers targeted by the subpoenas until recently.
The highly unusual subpoenas issued by the Trump-era DOJ sought data from Apple on at least two Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee, as well as aides, family members, and even one minor, with the goal of hunting down sources behind news reports about connections between Trump associates and Russia, The New York Times reported.
The Trump administration had also secretly obtained the phone records of journalists from The New York Times, CNN, and The Washington Post, according to The Times.
According to The Times' reporting, while the DOJ often investigates the sources of leaks, this is the first time the agency sought the communications of members of Congress — a move that led some DOJ officials to tell The Times that they viewed the investigations as politically motivated.
House Democrats and Biden's DOJ have opened separate investigations into the Trump-era probes, according to Axios.

How to use Apple Card Family to share a credit card with your spouse or children,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/apple-card-family,"Tue, 08 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Credit card experts agree that adding authorized users to your card — in other words, users who can use your card and receive all the same benefits — is a great way to earn rewards and build credit. 
If you use the Apple Card, you're probably used to the cashback rewards it gives you. If it's your main card, you should consider signing up for Apple Card Family.
Apple Card Family is a new program that lets you add a co-owner to your card, along with three other ""participants."" Every authorized user added gets access to the Apple Card, and everyone's expenses get counted towards one bill. And if that bill is paid off on time, everyone's credit score gets a boost.
Here's how to sign up for Apple Card Family and add your family members.
Important: You can't sign up for Apple Card Family unless you've already applied and been approved for an Apple Card.
The Apple Card Family plan works similarly to other authorized user plans.
Up to five people (including yourself) can use one Apple Card account. Two people can be named as co-owners, and three people can become participants.
Anyone in the Family plan can use the card via Apple Pay, or with the physical credit card.
Participants have to be at least 13 years old. And everyone involved in the Apple Card Family plan needs to be on the same Family Sharing plan.
To set up an Apple Card Family plan, you'll need to have already been approved for an Apple Card, and have set up a Family Sharing plan.
1. Open the Wallet app on your iPhone and select your Apple Card.
2. Tap the ellipsis icon in the top-right corner, then tap Share My Card.
Note: On an iPad, these first steps are a bit different. Instead of Wallet, open the Settings app and tap Wallet & Apple Pay, then Apple Card, and then Info. Once there, find the Share My Card option and tap it.
3. Tap Continue to accept the Family Sharing terms, then select whether you'd like to add a co-owner or participant. If you pick Co-Owners, you'll have to provide your shared income amount; if you pick Participant, you'll also have to set a spending limit for the new member.
4. Tap Send Invitation.

"Apple's Hybrid-Work Battle Heralds New Conflicts Between Employers, Staff",https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-hybrid-work-battle-employees-trend-2021-7,"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Employee pushback over Apple's return to work may be indicative of a ""widening chasm"" that could emerge between employers and staff if companies don't handle the return to the office correctly.
After decades of employers having the say over where, when and how work gets done, we've reached the other side of the spectrum over the last year, said Alexia Cambon, research director at Gartner.
""Employees have had more control over those dimensions of work and have realized how much those dimensions of work impact their lives,"" she told Insider, commenting generally on the challenge employers will face.  ""Suddenly having to yield control over those feels incredibly personal.""
In June, around 80 Apple staffers voiced frustration at feeling ""unheard"" and ""ignored"", in an internal letter to CEO Tim Cook following his announcement of plans to return to the office three days a week — on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays — from September.
Instead these staffers want those who are able to work remotely to be able to do so, and claim that Apple's policy has led to some colleagues quitting.
The company appears to have doubled down on its position, despite these concerns.
According to The Verge, Deirdre O'Brien, Apple UK's senior vice president of retail and people, stated in a video recording that there were likely to be few fully remote roles in the future. 
Employers around the world are differing in their approach to offices.
David Solomon, Goldman Sachs CEO, for example has called working from home an ""aberration"" and told staff to prepare for a widespread return to the physical office once coronavirus restrictions end. 
Facebook, in contrast, will allow all employees who can carry out their role from home to do so. 
External survey evidence indicates that those who want to work remotely full-time at Apple, which has a global workforce of more than 160,000 people, could be in the minority.
Only 11% of workers said they wanted to be fully remote in the future, according to a global survey of 5,043 full-time employees between Dec 2020 and January 2021 by McKinsey. Although a majority of respondents, 52% do want some flexible working post-covid.
Gartner research suggests that 68% of employees who worked remotely during the pandemic favour a hybrid model in the future, says Cambon. 
Particular ""teething problems"" between staff and employers are likely to center around location, said Cambon. 
Much of the conversation around the importance of returning to the office is being driven by an emphasis on the physical office being better for innovation and collaboration.
This runs counter to the experience of many employees working remotely, many of whom have been able to collaborate well, she added.
Organizations that implement ""listening strategies"" that provide employees with data and make those employees feel heard — then design hybrid working around that — are less likely to see battles emerging, she said.
Gartner's own research suggests 45% of employees agree that their long-term preferences for flexible work are not being taken seriously enough by leadership.
Likewise, McKinsey data suggests that it could be harmful if firms aren't clear about their post-pandemic plans: 47% of workers either agree, or strongly agree that a lack of clear vision about the office return is causing them concern or anxiety.

"Despite employee protest, Apple is still requiring most employees to return to the office in September",https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-demands-employees-return-to-office-in-september-2021-6,"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Apple isn't backing down: The company will require employees to return to offices at least three days each week starting in September.
""We believe that in-person collaboration is essential to our culture and our future,"" senior VP Deirdre O'Brien said in a video viewed by The Verge.
The message from Apple leadership comes just a few weeks after dozens of Apple staffers collaborated on an internal letter asking for a more flexible work-from-home policy going forward — a rare Apple employee revolt.
""It feels like there is a disconnect between how the executive team thinks about remote/location-flexible work and the lived experiences of many of Apple's employees,"" the letter said. 
Apple CEO Tim Cook initially announced the plan to return employees to the office in early June, which would have most Apple staff return to the office on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays, with Wednesday and Friday being optional work from home days.
By June 6, employees in a working-from-home Slack channel penned the letter to Cook asking for a more flexible policy.
It wasn't until a video featuring O'Brien was distributed that employees got a response, which said anyone requesting to work from home more permanently must get executive approval directly.

How to Unlock Your Mac With an Apple Watch,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/unlock-mac-with-apple-watch,"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"
You probably purchased your Apple Watch for its fitness trackers, or to easily use Apple Pay. But its features are growing year by year.
For example, you can use your Apple Watch to unlock your Mac. The ""Auto Unlock"" feature lets you pair an Apple Watch with a Mac that's signed into the same iCloud account, so you can unlock the Mac just by sitting down in front of it with the Watch on your wrist.
Here's how to make sure that you have the right gadgets to use Auto Unlock, and how to set it up.
Before you can use Auto Unlock, you'll need to make sure that your Watch and Mac are compatible and up-to-date. Make sure that your devices meet these criteria:
You'll also need to enable two-factor authentication on your iCloud account.
Quick note: If your Watch is running watchOS 6 or newer, and your Mac has macOS Catalina or newer, you can also use the Apple Watch whenever you're prompted to enter your Mac's administrator password.
Once you know that you have two compatible devices, turning on Auto Unlock is a painless process.
1. Log into your Mac and open the System Preferences menu. You can do this by clicking the Apple logo in the top-left corner of your screen and selecting System Preferences. It may also be pinned to your dock (its icon looks like a gray gear).
2. Open Security & Privacy and click on the General tab at the top of the window.
3. With your iPhone unlocked and your Apple Watch on your wrist, check off the box labeled Use your Apple Watch to unlock apps and your Mac. When prompted, enter your Mac's password.
You should now be able to unlock your Mac without entering its password, just by wearing your Apple Watch when you wake it.
Quick note: The first time you log in after you turn off, restart, or log out of your Mac, you'll still need to enter your password manually.
