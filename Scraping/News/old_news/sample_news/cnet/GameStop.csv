Netflix is already making a WallStreetBets and GameStop movie,https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/netflix-is-already-making-a-wallstreetbetsgamestop-movie/,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Of course it is.
  
Reddit users are betting they can take GameStop shares ""to the moon.""
One of the biggest stories of the year is barely a week old, but Hollywood is already calling. Two 
  movies
, including one from 
  Netflix
, are reportedly in the works to cover the story of the anti-establishment Redditors who trolled Wall Street.
Netflix has Zero Dark Thirty writer Mark Boal in its sights to pen a script, with Noah Centineo, star of the To All the Boys I've Loved Before Netflix movies, already attached to play one of the main roles.
Earlier, Deadline reported that MGM had snapped up the rights to a proposal for a book written by Ben Mezrich -- the same author who wrote the book The Social Network was adapted from. Michael DeLuca was a producer on the David Fincher film and, according to Deadline, this new project will pair him with Mezrich once more.
Here's a little background on what's been going down.
For years, Wall Street investors have been betting that video game retailer GameStop would fail. They said the move toward online game buying would eventually spell doom. The pandemic appeared to speed up those changes, too. Wall Street was so sure 
  GameStop
 would fail that they made it one of the most heavily bet-against stocks on the market.
Over the past few months though, a group of Reddit users have been buying up shares, pushing up GameStop's value and undermining Wall Street's big bets. At first, these forum traders bought because they believed the company was better off than the Wall Street doubters thought. Then, as GameStop value soared, Wall Street's bad bets started to cost investors billions of dollars.
It hasn't stopped there. The 
  Reddit
 users want the price to rise even more, as they wage an epic battle against Wall Street. At one point, the Reddit users from the forum r/WallStreetBets sent the stock up more than 14,300%, though it's gone through wild fluctuations. They've spread their strategy to struggling movie chain AMC and tech company 
  BlackBerry
, too.
You can see this has potential for a compelling movie.
Mezrich's book, which still doesn't have a publisher, is expected to go to out to publishers for auction in February.

Reddit's WallStreetBets had a dramatic Wednesday evening,https://www.cnet.com/culture/reddits-wallstreetbets-is-back-taking-on-gamestop-stock-after-intentional-lockdown/,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    But the community has been banned from Discord as AMC, GameStop stocks go wild.
  
One of Reddit's most active communities is no longer public.
For the past week, Reddit's r/WallStreetBets community has been the center of an epic war between large Wall Street investors and small-scale social media betters. On Wednesday evening, the community reeled from seeing the subreddit locked and hidden, only to be made public again about an hour later. Meanwhile, chat app Discord has banned WallStreetBets outright. 
Around the same time, spooked investors appeared to dump GameStop and AMC shares the community had been buying up to take on people betting against the company's futures. 
Then, as suddenly as everything began, the subreddit came back, a new Discord community was formed, and others bought in to the stocks, sending AMC and GameStop prices back up.
OK.
If all this is confusing, don't feel bad. These fast and dramatic moves are happening amid one of the most dramatic weeks on Wall Street in years. At stake are millions of dollars that small-time investors working together on social media have made while taking on Wall Street investors who bet GameStop and AMC stock would plummet. Instead, as the two company's stocks have soared, the Wall Street investors have reportedly hemorrhaged billions of dollars.
As the drama unfolded from the Discord ban and the Reddit community going on lockdown, GameStop shares fell 32% in after-hours trading late Wednesday, to $218.32 per share, down from $347.51 at their close. During the day, they'd more than doubled. AMC shares also fell, dropping more than 40%, to $11.90 per share, after closing at $19.90. That stock had risen more than 301% during the day.
Both stocks have recovered somewhat, and the r/WallStreetBets community is back. If you'd taken an hour and a half to watch Pixar's new movie, Soul, you'd have missed it.
Though GameStop shares have been jumping in recent days, analysts and experts say they're doing so because of quirks in the market and not because of actual increased value for the struggling video game retailer. The same is true for the movie theater chain AMC, which had warned it was near bankruptcy late last year.
All this wasn't the only bad news for the WallStreetBets community. Its worst community members, who repeatedly broke Discord's rules, caused the group to be banned from the platform, the chat app company said in a statement. ""Today, we decided to remove the server and its owner from Discord for  continuing to allow hateful and discriminatory content after repeated  warnings,"" Discord said. It added that the ban had nothing to do with any talk of finances or stock that happened among WallStreetBets users.
Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla who's helped to drive attention to the GameStop stock madness, tweeted his disappointment with Discord Wednesday.

Robinhood: What to know about the app at the center of the GameStop drama,https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-what-to-know-about-the-app-at-the-center-of-the-gamestop-drama/,"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks.

    The fee-free trading app has helped fuel activity during an unprecedented week on Wall Street.
  
When a Reddit community banded together to punish Wall Street investors who had bet against 
  GameStop
 shares, one app stood out as a weapon of choice: Robinhood. Traders from the r/WallStreetBets forum used the fee-free stock-trading app and others like it to push shares of the beaten-down game retailer 14,300% higher over the past few months, making short-selling hedge funds howl in pain. 
The popularity of the app was evident on Wednesday, when Robinhood jumped to the top spot in 
  Apple's
 App Store and notched a record 2.6 million daily active users, according to data from tracking firm Apptopia.  
A day later, however, Robinhood had fallen from favor with the group because it had restricted some activity such as GameStop trading, along with some other active stocks, limiting users to closing out positions rather than opening new ones. That had traders screaming foul. Even before trading had closed on Thursday, a lawsuit seeking class-action status against Robinhood had been filed in New York. In a second blog post published Thursday afternoon, Robinhood said it would reopen limited trading of the stocks on Friday. But on Friday, without mentioning Robinhood by name, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it would ""closely review actions taken by regulated entities that may disadvantage investors or otherwise unduly inhibit their ability to trade certain securities."" 
Here's what you need to know about Robinhood, its past and recent controversies, and how it works.  
Read more: GameStop stock spike lingo: This is what Reddit's WallStreetBets vocabulary means
Robinhood is a financial services company founded in 2013 for the purpose of democratizing the financial system, giving people the opportunity to make fee-free investments. Its main product is an app designed to make it easy buy and sell stocks without a financial broker or commissions. Robinhood also offers cash management accounts and cryptocurrency trading.  
Some state regulators and academics have accused Robinhood of ""gamifying"" investing by doing things like rewarding you for making trades with a confetti animation. The app also lets you browse the 100 most-held stocks to determine what you might want to buy next. The company says those app elements are meant to draw in young investors from diverse backgrounds.  
First, you need to download the Robinhood app for 
  iOS
 or Android and create an account. New members who sign up through a promotional page will get one free stock added to their account to keep or sell. The app requires you to enter your social security number and address. You'll also need to connect a bank account. 
Inside the app, you can search for a stock and see price and activity stretching back five years. You'll also see news stories and analyst ratings about the companies, as well as similar stocks that other people invest in. When you click Buy, you'll have the option to pay for your purchase in shares or in dollars. You can also set up recurring investments and other instructions, such as price limits. Hit Review, swipe up and your stock has been purchased. 
You might be wondering: If Robinhood is letting me buy and sell stocks without a fee, how does the company make money? Here's where things get a bit complicated.  
When you buy or sell stocks through Robinhood, the company doesn't actually execute those trade requests. Instead, it routes the orders through a ""market maker"" (like Citadel Securities or Virtu) which in turn offers Robinhood a rebate. This is also called ""payment for order flow."" The practice is common, though often criticized for lacking transparency. Among the concerns: who pays the broker and whether there are other benefits the broker gets for directing orders to market makers. For example, a broker could potentially direct orders to a specific market maker to make a larger cut, even if it isn't in the investor's best interest. 
Bottom line? In exchange for a fee-free buying and selling experience for you, Robinhood is selling your order to another firm, and both make money off of it. 
Robinhood offers commission-free trading.
On Thursday, Robinhood (along with TD Ameritrade) began restricting some transactions of GameStop and other companies that Redditors had begun targeting because of ""recent volatility,"" according to a blog post. (The other companies affected included AMC, Nokia and 
  BlackBerry
.) 
After this happened, GameStop and AMC stock dropped dramatically. A class-action lawsuit was filed in the Southern District of New York against Robinhood for restricting trades. The complaint says the company ""purposefully, willfully and knowingly"" removed GameStop during its extraordinary run-up and ""thereby deprived retail investors of the ability to invest in the open market.""  
Robinhood didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. But users quickly expressed their displeasure, flooding the Google Play Store with tens of thousands of bad reviews for the app. Google cleared out lots of the deliberate slams, which had temporarily brought the app's overall rating down to one star.  
Members of Congress have also weighed in. Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib joined with Republican Sen. Ted Cruz to tweet support for a hearing on Robinhood's decision to restrict the trading.  
In a second blog post published Thursday afternoon, Robinhood said it would allow limited buying in the affected securities on Friday. The company will continue to monitor the situation and adjust as needed, the post said.  
""To be clear, this was a risk-management decision, and was not made on the direction of the market makers we route to,"" the post said.  
On Dec. 16, 2020, Massachusetts security regulators filed a complaint against Robinhood for violations of state law, including its ""aggressive tactics to attract new, often inexperienced, investors"" and its ""use of strategies such as gamification to encourage and entice continuous and repetitive use of its trading application.""  
The next day, the SEC charged Robinhood for alleged ""repeated misstatements that failed to disclose the firm's receipt of payments from trading firms for routing customer orders to them, and with failing to satisfy its duty to seek the best reasonably available terms to execute customer orders."" That refers to the routing of order flow to market makers. 
According to the SEC, between 2015 and 2018, Robinhood failed to disclose that it made money from payments for its order flow and that it executed orders at higher rates than its competitors, despite claiming it was offering prices that matched or beat its competitors. The SEC said the activity stripped customers of $34.1 million, even after adjusting for commission-free trades. 
Robinhood agreed to pay $65 million to settle the charges.  
On Friday, the SEC said it would ""closely review"" what happened during the GameStop stock drama this week, stating, ""We will act to protect retail investors when the facts demonstrate abusive or manipulative trading activity that is prohibited by the federal securities laws."" The organization did not mention Robinhood by name. 
Several other apps perform a similar service to Robinhood, offering commission-free stock trading. These include: 
TD Ameritrade: Named the best stock trading platform by both NerdWallet and StockBrokers, TD Ameritrade offers tools for both beginners and active traders. Like Robinhood, it features commission-free stock, ETF and options trades. It also restricted some trading of GameStop and AMC. 
WeBull: WeBull also offers commission-free trading of stocks, ETFs and options. While this app temporarily restricted trades in GameStop and AMC on Thursday, those restrictions have since been lifted.  
Cash App: Cash App allows you to send and receive money, similar to Venmo. But it also has an investing option, allowing commission-free stock trades similar to Robinhood. It's a bit more of a beginner's platform, with fewer features than Robinhood. It also gives you the ability to buy fractional shares, which many other platforms don't. The app is owned by 
  Square
 and CEO Jack Dorsey. 
Fidelity: Fidelity is a more traditional online broker that offers commission-free trades, research and strong trading tools, according to StockBrokers, which named it the best trading platform for everyday investors.  
E*Trade: One of the first online brokerages in the US, E*Trade also offers commission-free trades, and a strong selection of trading tools. StockBrokers named it the top web trading platform and the best trader app.

AOC spoke to a number of Wall Street experts.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez took to Twitch tonight to live stream her thoughts on the GameStop stock-trading drama. 300,000 people watched on the stream at its peak, which was plagued by technical issues in the beginning.
When the stream eventually got started AOC spoke to Alexis Goldstein, who spent seven years on Wall Street before getting involved with Occupy the SEC—a working group in Occupy Wall Street that focuses on financial regulation. She provided a primer on the Reddit WallStreetBets community, who banded together and used Robinhood and other financial services apps to push GameStop stocks 14,000% higher over the last few months after Wall Street hedge funds bet against those shares.

Robinhood and TD Ameritrade restricted trading of GameStop and AMC stock on Thursday citing ""market volatility."" Soon after, a lawsuit seeking class-action status against Robinhood was filed in New York. Robinhood changed course late Thursday, saying it would ""allow limited buys of these securities"" on Friday.
AOC had previously been vocal about her criticism of Robinhood's actions, tweeting that we need to know more about the app's ""decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit."" AOC added that as a member of the House Financial Services Committee, she supports a hearing on the matter.

GameStop stock run gives it a bigger market cap than several actual video game companies,https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/gamestop-stock-run-gives-it-a-bigger-market-cap-than-several-actual-video-game-companies-gme/,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Watch out Take-Two.
  
GameStop shares are running hot right now.
GameStop's massive run on Wall Street this month hasn't just given nice profits to members of the WallStreetBets Reddit board, it's also made the retailer bigger than some of the video game companies whose products it sells. 
The run, which has seen GameStop stock soar from under $17.25 a share at the start of the year to nearly $400 a share early Thursday, gives the beleaguered video game retailer a market cap of roughly $28 billion. This puts GameStop ahead of firms such as Take-Two Interactive, Ubisoft and Square Enix. 
Take-Two, which owns Grand Theft Auto publisher Rockstar Games as well as 2K (makers of the popular NBA 2K franchise) was valued Thursday morning at $23.07 billion. France-based Ubisoft, which owns the Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs franchises, was valued at $12.39 billion, and Japan-based Square Enix, maker of Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts, at $6.95 billion. 
Despite the massive run, GameStop still has a ways to go to catch top game publishers Activision Blizzard ($70.32 billion market cap), EA ($41.97 billion) and hardware makers Nintendo ($72.1 billion), Sony ($123.54 billion) and Microsoft ($1.8 trillion). 
Whether the company can sustain its improbable run, of course, remains the multibillion-dollar question. TD Ameritrade has restricted some trading of GameStop stock, as well as other stocks mentioned by the Reddit board including movie theater chain AMC. Robinhood joined the blocking on Thursday morning. The company explained its decision in a blog post, saying that ""in light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only."" It proceeded to list a number of companies popular on Reddit including GameStop, AMC, Express and Nokia. 
The volatility also hasn't always worked in the stocks' favor. GameStop stock was down over 30% at times in after-hours trading on Wednesday, but the stock's fans seem to have rallied in the face of apparent pressure from Robinhood and TD Ameritrade. GameStop stock was up over 10% in early trading, with people getting topics like ""DO NOT SELL"" to trend on Twitter in the US while advising others to use apps such as Webull and the Cash App's Investing option to trade securities.

One of the biggest stories of the year is barely a week old, but Hollywood is already calling. Two 
  movies
, including one from 
  Netflix
, are reportedly in the works to cover the story of the anti-establishment Redditors who trolled Wall Street.
Netflix has Zero Dark Thirty writer Mark Boal in its sights to pen a script, with Noah Centineo, star of the To All the Boys I've Loved Before Netflix movies, already attached to play one of the main roles.

    Keith Gill, who made millions off a surprise jump in GameStop stock, is increasingly under the spotlight. He insists he did nothing wrong.
  
GameStop stock swung wildly after Keith Gill started hyping its prospects.
Keith Gill goes by several names online, including Roaring Kitty on YouTube and DeepFuckingValue on Reddit. Now he'll be adding defendant to the list. Law firm Hagens Berman filed a class action suit on Tuesday against Gill, accusing him of exaggerated claims, misrepresented posts and other similar behavior as he helped kick off a market frenzy over GameStop's shares. At one point, enthusiasm for the stock pushed the struggling retailer's shares up more than 2,700% from the beginning of the year. In the process, Gill was said to have netted more than $30 million.
""In order to motivate amateur traders, Gill fashioned himself as a kind of Robin Hood and characterized securities professionals as villains,"" says the lawsuit, which was filed on behalf of plaintiff Christian  Iovin, who participated in the drama. ""Gill's  deceitful  and  manipulative  conduct  not  only  violated  numerous  industry regulations and rules, but also various securities laws by undermining the integrity of the market for GameStop shares.""
The suit is seeking punitive damages. Gill didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The suit isn't the only thing Gill's facing this week. On Thursday, he and other people at the center of the GameStop stock drama will participate in a hearing held by the US House Committee on Financial Services. The hearing, called ""Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide,"" is seeking an explanation for the stock volatility. The chief executives of social network Reddit, stock trading app Robinhood, and funds Citadel and Melvin Capital are also confirmed to attend. CNET will be streaming the hearing on our YouTube channel when it begins around 9 a.m. PT/noon ET.
One question facing Congress is whether any bad behavior happened as the stock's price swung wildly. Reddit users are accusing hedge funds and Robinhood of attempting to manipulate the stock market, shutting off trading of GameStop's shares as they began falling from their peak of about $483.
As for Gill, in written hearing testimony posted Wednesday, he insisted he acted properly.
""I did not solicit anyone to buy or sell the stock for my own profit,"" he said. ""I did not belong to any groups trying to create movements in the stock price.  I never had a financial relationship with any hedge fund.  I had no information about GameStop except what was public.  I did not know any people inside the company, and I never spoke to any insider.""
And though the company's share price has fallen, Gill said he still believes it's undervalued, closing his testimony with an internet meme: ""In short, I like the  stock."""

    Investors organizing on social media hit multimillion-dollar paydays as they fought Wall Street over GameStop's share price. Experts say it can't last.
  
GameStop shares are on an epic roller coaster that pushed them to the stratosphere. But for how long?
Many of today's adults spent their youths in 
  GameStop
 stores. They lined up for console launches. They bought and sold games there, too. Now some of those gamers are rich after buying GameStock's stock and encouraging their friends on 
  Reddit
 to buy it too. GameStop's shares rocketed higher than ever expected in the past couple weeks, and all because activity among social media investors began pushing it up. Wall Street had bet heavily that the company would fail, but as the price kept going up, investors were forced to reset their wagers. That led the stock to rocket up, and then swing wildly.
And though the share price dipped on Monday, Feb. 1, by more than 30%, many Reddit users say they're buying more GameStop stock, convinced it'll rocket even higher.
Jaime Rogozinski, the apparent founder of the Reddit community at the heart of all this, told The Wall Street Journal it's like ""a train wreck happening in real time."" Keith Gill, the trader in the Reddit community who helped kick off the battle, told the paper he ""didn't expect this.""
Last week, on Thursday alone, GameStop's stock hit all-time highs of $492.02 per share, only to drop by more than half a minute later. It closed trading at $325 the next day.
GameStop itself hasn't fundamentally changed in the past month. It's still a struggling retailer facing an uncertain future against the rising tide of online shopping. But its stock has shot up as much as 1,800% -- that's not a typo -- since the beginning of the year. This dynamic's led Wall Street investors who bet against the company's future to lose billions of dollars, and the excitement is driving the hype even further.
Over the past couple weeks, the financial world watched in shock as GameStop stock (or ""stonk"" as the reddit community calls it) rose to unthinkable levels. Even Elon Musk tweeted about it, pointing his 43 million followers to a link of the Reddit community investing in GameStop, called r/WallStreetBets.
By the close of regular trading on Wednesday, Jan. 27, the stock was $347.51 per share, up from from historic lows of around $3.30 per share in the summer of 2019. And then in after-hours trading, it dropped by more than 37%, only to rise again. The next day saw even more dramatic moves, with the stock jumping up to $492.02 before dropping nearly 60% to close at $197.44. Then, in after-hours trading, it rose back up to $311.99.
Meanwhile, stock market trading apps appeared to either stop or impose restrictions on GameStop share purchasing for at least part of the day. 
The popular stock trading app Robinhood drew particular attention for what appeared to be the among the most restrictive new rules. People had been raising concerns about Robinhood for a while, saying it ""gamified"" stock trading to a potentially dangerous degree. Now it's being accused of outright market manipulation, including through at least one class action lawsuit filed already. Robinhood, for its part, said last week that market rules effectively forced it to put those restrictions in place.

""We're seeing a phenomenon that I have never seen,"" Jim Cramer, a Wall Street commentator on CNBC and a former hedge fund manager, said during a segment as shares were first beginning to swing. And GameStop could be just the start. ""It's insane.""
This may seem like an oddball story about Wall Street investors being overrun by excited social media users. For some, it's been fun to watch those investors get taken to the cleaners by a bunch of people posting rocket emojis, saying GameStop shares will go ""to the moon.""
Reddit users are betting they can take GameStop shares ""to the moon.""
But for some on Wall Street, it's the latest sign of how social media can upend everyday life. Twitter has changed the worlds of news and politics. YouTube and Instagram have transformed the fashion, beauty and entertainment industries. Now Reddit is taking on Wall Street.
These worlds have overlapped as well. Fans of Korean pop groups, known as K-pop stans, post floods of tweets about their favorite stars to overwhelm racist hashtags on Twitter. And TikTokers banded together in attempts to confuse President Donald Trump's reelection campaign.
Now emboldened Reddit communities are talking about taking on other companies that Wall Street is broadly betting against. The Reddit crowd is already attempting to push up BlackBerry, the once-popular handset maker that now focuses primarily   on selling business software. And Redditors are also targeting the struggling movie chain AMC, pushing its stock from hovering around $2 per share to more than $8 in after-hours trading. By Wednesday, Jan. 27, it closed at $19.90 per share before dropping to $12.75. The next day, it fell even further, to $8.63 per share.
The Reddit community's actions have had such an impact that TD Ameritrade took the extraordinary step last week to limit share trading on Game Stop and AMC stocks, ""out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions."" Nasdaq as well warned that it will halt trading on stocks it thinks are being manipulated by social media.
Meantime, traffic to the Reddit community at the center of the drama, r/WallStreetBets, is breaking records. Mashable reported that r/WallStreetBets counted 73 million page views for its discussion boards on Tuesday, Jan. 26, as stocks began to swing. Over a seven day span, it hit about 700 million page views. Reddit is already the 46th most popular site on the web, notching more than 78 million unique visitors in December, according to comScore. And on Wednesday, Jan. 27, Reddit's mobile app tallied its biggest single day of downloads, industry watcher Apptopia said.
The whole drama's even caught the attention of Saturday Night Live, which lampooned the Reddit investors as the latest sign Wall Street isn't working.
But when the memes stop and the excitement goes away, GameStop will go back to being that struggling video game retailer at a time when gaming is increasingly moving toward streaming and the idea of stepping into a physical store is still a nerve-wracking prospect during a pandemic. At that point, stock analysts say, whoever's left holding shares will see their value evaporate.
""This is unnatural, insane and dangerous,"" Michael Burry, a prominent GameStop investor and one of the subjects of the book and movie The Big Short, wrote in a now-deleted tweet. His roughly $17 million investment in the company ballooned to at least $250 million last week, give or take a few swings in the share price, Markets Insider reported.
Many gamers spent their childhoods going to GameStop.
Michael Pachter, a longtime video game industry analyst at Wedbush Securities, said he hasn't even bothered to update his stock price expectations for GameStop since shares started going crazy. ""Who's listening?"" he said in an interview last week. ""Nobody cares what a sell-side analyst says right now.""
To him, there are reasonable explanations why people could be somewhat excited about GameStop. One of its newest board members, Ryan Cohen, helped turn Chewy into one of the largest online pet product sellers in the world, before selling it to PetSmart. GameStop's also on a track to being profitable again.
But that doesn't come close to explaining GameStop's share price now. ""It's a Ponzi scheme,"" Pachter said, referring to a form of fraud that appears to make money but in fact is only propped up by funding from new investors. ""There is a point where it'll go down.""
Many of the Reddit users buying up GameStop shares see this as a way to fight Wall Street greed.
He suspects that may happen after the company reports its quarterly results in March, at which point executives and investors on the board are allowed to sell their shares.
In the meantime, industry watchers are attempting to understand what forces are at play in the drama, and what these swings say about the economy.
""When you see what's happening with GameStop, you ask yourself, is this  manipulation, is this mass psychosis or is there something wrong in our  market structure that is causing this to happen,"" James Angel, a  finance professor at Georgetown University's McDonough School of  Business, told the New York Times.
One thing analysts watching wonder is whether the Reddit investors will lose their millions whenever the stock eventually crashes back to earth. Rogozinski, the man who helped found the Reddit community, said their approach to investing as more like gambling than traditional analysis and strategy. Its members, who the community identifies as ""degenerates,"" often encourage one another to push all their funds into one stock, riding it up and down. Their posts are punctuated with phrases like ""hold the line"" and ""diamond hands"" (hold onto your stocks for a long time) and YOLO (you only live once).
He told the WSJ he never imagined the Reddit community would morph from its beginnings to what it's become. ""It's a little like watching one of those horror films where you can see the bad guy slowly going up the stairs,"" Rogozinski           said.
Indeed, even Keith Gill, the community member who helped kickstart the initial battle over GameStop, told the Journal he was surprised by what it'd turned into.
""I thought this trade would be successful,"" he said, ""but I never expected what happened over the past week.""
In the meantime, the social media hype is continuing on Reddit, where users are declaring their intention to buy and hold more GameStop shares, all to send prices even higher.
""My mom told me it's time to sell,"" one Reddit user wrote on a post about GameStop's stock moves. ""Should I find a new mom?""
""Yes,"" another user answered. ""The answer is yes.""

GameStop stock is falling after Reddit surge. Here's why that's not a surprise,https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/gamestop-continues-to-fall-after-reddit-surge-heres-why-you-shouldnt-be-surprised/,"Fri, 05 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    From declining sales to shuttered stores, the underlying value of this company is still questionable, and stock gains don't change that.
  
GameStop's stock price won't help the stores make more money. 

  GameStop
's stock price soared last week due to a concerted effort by traders on Reddit. The video game retailer's shares grew by more than 14,300%, but they've since plummeted, going from $328 on Friday to a close of $53.50 on Thursday. Fans of the stock continue to hold their GameStop shares to stick it to Wall Street and hedge funds, but don't be fooled, the company isn't doing so hot. 
The share price for GameStop doesn't tell the whole story about the company. Indeed, one of the reasons for its stratospheric gains is that so many institutional investors were betting on it to fail -- to an absurd degree. That type of investing, known as short selling, opened the door to individuals who coordinated their efforts online to drive up the price. 
Stock prices have, at some level, always been disconnected from reality for the average American (just stack 2020's stock market gains against the pandemic-fueled economic collapse), but this GameStop roller coaster ride throws all logic and basic investment principles out the window. To those on the WallStreetBets subreddit, that's the point. 
Lost in all the hoopla is that GameStop continues to falter when it comes to all the important metrics for a company, with declining 
  sales
 and the closing of 462 stores last year. Let's take a look at how GameStop is performing as an actual business, and not just as the 
  target
 of some enthusiastic individual investors. 
Not that great. According to its fiscal third-quarter 
  earnings


Meanwhile, digital sales for 
  games
 reached new heights. Major publishers such as 
  Sony
, 
  EA
 and Take-Two reported that digital purchases surpassed physical sales in 2020, according to Daniel Ahmad, an analyst at Niko Partners. Microsoft's Game Pass, which lets gamers access more than 100 games for $15 a month, hit 18 million subscribers, CEO Satya Nadella said on the company's second-quarter earnings conference call. 
EA said that 52% of its console full game unit sales in the past 12 months were via digital downloadFor reference, Take Two says its ratio was 55% for FY2020Sony said that 51% of all games sold on PS4 in FY2020 were digitalIn other words. We enter next gen with digital >50%
Cloud gaming also grew in 2020. Microsoft's xCloud and Nvidia's Geforce Now launched last year, following Google's Stadia service, which came out in late 2019. These services let players stream games without the need for physical copies of games or even 
  consoles
.
In September 2019, GameStop CEO George Sherman tried to get gamers back into stores by turning a few test stores into hangouts for customers. But the company closed 462 stores in 2020, with plans to shutter more than 1,000 stores total by March. It still has more than 5,000 stores in the US. 
On Dec. 1, GameStop's stock price was $15.80 a share, which gave it a market value of slightly more than $1 billion. As of Friday, the retailer's shares were trading at $325 apiece, valuing the company at more than $22 billion. That put it at No. 464 on the Fortune 500 list, right behind video game publisher Activision Blizzard. The jump in stock price vaulted the value of GameStop over that of game publishers Ubisoft, Take-Two and Square Enix. Thursday saw the shares continue their fall to $53.50, making the market cap for the retailer at approximately $3.7 billion.
Though the retailer struggled in recent years, it wasn't at death's door. 
""I actually think they are in a good position to grow revenue and earnings again with the console launches,"" said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter. ""Earnings power like that supports a price in the high teens or low 20s.""
Pachter has GameStop's stock at a target price of $16. Keep in mind this is just one analyst's assessment.
The retailer did receive some help in recent months thanks to the release of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles. Both are still in high demand and selling out swiftly whenever they're in stock. GameStop reported $1.7 billion in sales this past holiday season. Online sales made up 34% of the total holiday sales, which was a 300% increase from the previous year.   
GameStop said it will bring on Matt Francis, an engineering leader at Amazon Web Service, to be the company's first chief technology officer, according to a report from Marketwatch on Wednesday. He will oversee GameStop's e-commerce operations when he starts on Feb. 15. 
What's important to know is that GameStop's inflated prices don't equate to financial success. It still has problems that need to be addressed.
Remember that while deciding whether this is a roller coaster you'd want to brave."
Xbox Series X price: What Microsoft's next-gen console will really cost you,https://www.cnet.com/deals/xbox-series-x-price-what-microsofts-next-gen-console-will-really-cost-you/,"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. 

    The Xbox Series X may list for $500, but if you want to own one, double that. Here's what you need to know about pricing on the next-gen console.
  
Microsoft's official list price for the new Xbox is either $500 or $300, depending on the model. The Xbox Series X (which comes with an optical drive and outputs at 4K resolution) costs $500, while the more modest Xbox Series S lists for $300. The Series S has a slower processor, less internal storage, 1440p output instead of 4K and no optical drive. Despite crippling inventory shortages, all the major retailers continue to respect this pricing and sell the consoles at Microsoft's list price. That's cold comfort, though, because of the chronic out-of-stock status means that the only real marketplace to snag the Xbox Series X/S is through resellers where it regularly sells for no less than twice the price. 
For months, whenever retailers have gotten inventory and released units for sale, they've sold out within minutes, in large part thanks to resellers' use of bots that complete transactions far faster than any human. Some retailers have begun to crack down on these reseller bots, but the bots continue to prevent many people from getting consoles. These bot-acquired consoles are being resold at a premium. On eBay, for example, it's possible to find the Xbox Series X priced between $700 and $1,100. Some of the pricier deals are actually bundles that include accessories and games, but they're still grossly overpriced and not a good value, especially since you probably wouldn't buy the included accessories if you had a free choice.  
We've been offering the same advice for months now: Wait until you can get an Xbox Series X at the $500 retail price and avoid resellers and bundles.
In the meantime, Xbox restocks do happen on a regular basis, and gamers with fast reaction times have managed to snag a console. We are keeping an eye on inventory drops and let you know when one is imminent. Be sure to check out our Xbox Series X restock status article for more details. Below is a list of all the major retailers (and a couple of reputable resellers, if you absolutely must) to help you get your own console. 
When in stock. Amazon sells the Xbox Series X for $500 and the Xbox Series S for $300 from the same product page. 
Best Buy lists the Xbox Series X for $500 on this page. 
At GameStop, the Xbox Series X lists for $500. 
This is Target's product page for the Xbox Series X, where the console sells for $500. 
Walmart offers the Xbox Series X (when in stock) for $500. You might also want to visit the retailer's Xbox landing page for both new consoles. 
NewEgg sells both the Xbox Series X for $500 and the Xbox Series S for $300 on this page. 
We highly recommend waiting for inventory to appear at ordinary retailers, so you can buy an Xbox Series X at the regular retail price. If you can't wait, you can find Xbox Series X consoles at eBay with bids starting around $500, but actual sale prices are closer to $850 and up. 
If you're willing to pay hundreds of dollars over the list price, then StockX is a reputable eBay-style site that will let you buy new Xbox consoles. That said, the lowest price we could find is around $650 and averages closer to $800.

PS5 price: What Sony's new console really costs you,https://www.cnet.com/deals/ps5-price-what-sonys-new-console-really-costs-you/,"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNET,"Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. 

    The PlayStation 5 may list for as little as $400, but if you really want to own one right now, try doubling that. Here's what you need to know about PS5 pricing.
  
Conventional wisdom holds that the PlayStation 5 is priced at $400 or $500, depending upon which model you purchase. The ""standard"" PS5 with the Blu-Ray drive sells for $500, and there's a nearly identical digital-only version that lacks an optical drive and sells for a more modest $400 (though even that pales in comparison to the downright thrifty $300 Xbox Series S). But it's hard to make that argument when the PS5 has been sold out for three months at those prices, and the only real marketplace for the console routinely sees prices two or three times higher. 
Resellers across the internet have been snapping up Sony's next-gen console using bots that can complete transactions far faster than any human. Some retailers have started to crack down on these reseller bots, but they remain a menace and have prevented many people from getting consoles at launch and during subsequent retailer restocks. Regardless, these consoles are being resold at a premium. Right now on eBay, for example, it's possible to find the PS5 bundled with one or two accessories selling for as little as $650 or as much as $1,500. 
We've been dispensing the same advice for months now: No console, not even the PS5, is worth spending hundreds over retail. That's especially true with so little content available that's specifically optimized for the PS5. We suggest that you keep playing your PS4 for a few more months until a meaningful amount of inventory arrives at retailers later this year. 
In the meantime, PS5 restocks do in fact happen, and gamers with fast reaction times have managed to snag a console. We are keeping an eye on inventory drops and let you know when one is imminent -- be sure to check out our PS5 restock status article for more details. Below, you can find a list of all the major retailers (and a couple of reputable resellers) to help you get your own console. 
Amazon sells the Digital Edition for $400 (see the button below). Alternately, the PS5 with Blu-ray sells for $500.
Best Buy is selling the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500. You can also get the $400 Digital Edition (which you can find by clicking the button below).
GameStop offers both the Digital Edition ($400, click the button below) and the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500.
Walmart offers the Digital Edition for $400 (click the button below) plus the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500.
Target offers the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500 in addition to the PS5 Digital Edition for $400, which you can find by clicking the button below.
To be clear, we recommend waiting for inventory to appear at retail. But if you need a PS5 right now, we haven't seen one on eBay for under $650. The average price on eBay appears to be about $800. 
If you've decided you're willing to pay hundreds over list price to get a console now, you might want to check out StockX. Right now, it appears that $700 is the least you can spend on a PS5, and prices go substantially higher.

Finding a Sony PS5 is like participating in an elaborate game of hide-and-seek. It's out there somewhere; on any given day, retailers such as Best Buy, GameStop and Sony's own PlayStation Store may suddenly have a PS5 restock. We're doing our best to update you when that happens, but in the meantime you can try your luck by using our PS5 inventory links below.
If you do happen upon some PlayStation 5 availability and find yourself in a queue to complete the check-out process, use as many devices and web browsers as you can. On a desktop, for example, you could open the store page in Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Then you could do likewise on your phone and tablet. It's like with lottery tickets: The more you have, the better your chances of winning, or in this case buying a console.
Just can't wait another minute? You have little choice but to pay obscene markups on sites like eBay and StockX. On eBay, for example, we've seen the PS5 priced well over $1,000. 
The PS5 is available in two versions: There's a $500 model with a Blu-ray drive and an otherwise identical $400 digital-only version with no disc slot. At this point, people are happy to get their hands on either one, but if you don't have a library of optical discs -- for Blu-ray movies, used 
  games
 or old PS4 games -- CNET recommends that you go with the $400 version.   
Read more at GameSpot: Latest PS5 news
Remember to check back here for news and updates on new PS5 availability. You can also browse all the major retailers to see their restock status. The list below has links to the PS5 product pages at each store.    
Best Buy is offering the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500 as well as the $400 Digital Edition (which you can find by clicking the button below). The retailer is also offering a slew of accessories on its PS5 landing page.
You can check out Amazon's page for the $400 Digital Edition via the button below, or, if you'd rather, get in line for the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500.
You can check inventory on the $400 Digital Edition at Walmart by clicking the button below, or you can try to snag the pricier PS5 with Blu-ray for $500.
GameStop will offer both the $400 Digital Edition (click the button below) as well as the pricier PS5 with Blu-ray for $500. Expect to also be able to buy a full range of PS5 accessories from GameStop like the Pulse 3D wireless headset for $100.
Target will be offering the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500 in addition to the PS5 Digital Edition, which you can find by clicking the button below.
OK, you've exhausted all of the online and brick-and-mortar retailers, and you've decided you're willing to pay upward of a $300 markup to get this puppy soon. As your friends, we have to tell you: Don't do it. But if you don't want to listen to us, you might want to check out StockX, an eBay alternative that made its name in the secondary market for sneakers and designer clothing. Last time we checked, prices for the PS5 were hovering just below $700.
If you've decided you simply can't wait another moment for Sony to get its act together and flood the market with inventory, eBay is a shortcut to getting your own PS5 right now. That said, let me reiterate our advice: No PS5 is worth spending hundreds over list price, and that's exactly what you'll have to do if you buy from an eBay reseller. The average PS5 price on eBay is about $900.

GameStop stock surge lingo: Here's what Reddit's WallStreetBets vocabulary means,https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/gamestop-stock-surge-lingo-heres-what-reddits-wallstreetbets-vocabulary-means/,"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Here are some of the slang terms that are part of a movement that's assisting in driving the price of some stocks.
  
Reddit's community, WallStreetBets, is still assisting in the rise of GameStop's stock, which is currently sitting at $272 per share and even hit an all-time high last week. Reddit users are battling it out with Wall Street to keep GameStop's stock prices soaring while Wall Street expected a crash. Small investors are using Reddit communities to drive ""meme stocks,"" causing short sales and short squeezes. And it's not just GameStop. Other companies, like AMC and Nokia, have also been affected by the coordinated surge.
No, this doesn't mean you should necessarily drop everything and fully invest in the stock of the moment. Some are calling the market manipulation a ""Ponzi scheme,"" and the stock price will likely even out once the hullabaloo dies down. 
In fact, broker TD Ameritrade restricted trading of the GameStop and AMC stocks on Jan. 26 and continues to post an advisory note to clients about market volatility. Trading app Robinhood followed suit on Jan. 27 in response to the runaway growth -- the company got itself into trouble by restricting stock trades and will be closely reviewed by the SEC (It's currently limiting buys on AMC and GameStop stocks). The White House has said it's monitoring the situation.
Part of what's so unusual about the GameStop stock spike is the vocabulary that's been used to drive the trading action. Elon Musk, founder of Tesla and SpaceX, helped fuel the activity with a one-word tweet on Jan. 26: ""Gamestonk."" 
What's a stonk, and what does it have to do with trading? Here's a sampling of the lingo behind the enormous highs, and what the terms mean: 
Stonks is often associated with Meme Man, pictured.

Robinhood backlash: What you should know about the GameStop stock controversy,https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/investing/robinhood-backlash-what-you-should-know-about-the-gamestop-stock-controversy/,"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    Lawmakers, regulators and Reddit aren't happy with the popular investing app.
  
Robinhood users aren't so merry. 
Popular 
  investing
 app Robinhood became the focus of the controversy after it decided to freeze trades for 
  GameStop
 on Jan. 28. Shares of the video game retailer spiked after traders on 
  Reddit
 began frantically buying the company's stock. GameStop shares have since came crashing down only to shoot up once again. 
Robinhood played a critical role when a group of Reddit posters saw an opportunity to make 
  money
 while also giving a jab to Wall Street and hedge funds. However, Robinhood made the surprising move to restrict buying GameStop citing issues with volatile stock and regulatory requirements. Due to its part in the trading frenzy, Robinhood has been scrutinized by its users, regulators and lawmakers. 
We have some answers for the big questions about Robinhood, the actions it took and what might happen next.

Robinhood is an investing app that launched in 2015. It's popular among millennials, who make up a majority of its users and can conduct a variety of investments for free. Read more about Robinhood here. 
On the morning of Jan. 28, Robinhood posted a blog saying it was limiting users by preventing them from buying stocks from several companies such as GameStop, 
  AMC
 and 
  Nokia
. It cited ""market volatility"" as its reasoning and would only allow customers to sell their shares of these companies, not buy or trade in any other way (more below). 
""In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AMC, $BB, $BBBY, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD and $NOK,"" Robinhood said. In addition to AMC; Bed, Bath and Beyond; GameStop and Nokia, the companies that Robinhood listed by ticker symbol are phone maker BlackBerry, fashion retailer Express, headphone maker Koss and underwear company Naked Brand Group.
In light of current market volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities to position closing only, including $AMC and $GME. Read more here.https://t.co/CdJMjGAeFH
On Jan. 29, Robinhood posted another blog about what happened. The company explained it was required to keep a substantial amount of money on hand in order to process all the trades happening through its clearinghouse, which is the part of the company that sends shares and money back and forth to other clearinghouses to complete trades. 
Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev went into more specifics when he 
  jumped
 on the Good Time Show with Tesla CEO Elon Musk via the exclusive audio-only Clubhouse app on Jan. 31.
""At 3:30 a.m. Pacific, our operations receives a file from the NSCC, which is the National Securities Clearing Corporation,"" he said during the show. ""So they gave us a file with a deposit, and the request was around $3 billion, which is about an order of magnitude more than it typically is."" 
Tenev provided some context by saying that, up to that point, Robinhood had raised just $2 billion in capital. He went on to explain that the NSCC has a formula to determine how much a deposit it needed and one component of it involved risk, which can act as a kind of multiplier. 
""We had no choice in this case,"" he said. ""We had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements."" 
Tenev said that since then, the agency has worked with Robinhood to decrease the amount of funds needed. The company also raised $1 billion in emergency capital to make sure customers' trades can happen. 
Robinhood sent an email to customers in the afternoon of Jan. 28 saying it would allow ""limited buys"" of those company stock starting the next day. The limits included a maximum number of shares users could own (at one point it was down to one GameStop share), no trading options, no borrowing money on credit also known as margin, recurring investments were skipped and no fractional shares, which are slices of a stock that can be bought for as little as a dollar. 
As of Feb. 3, Robinhood increased the maximum of shares allowed for all the companies, with GameStop's limit up to 500 shares total. The other restrictions are still in place. 
A ton of people. The subreddit behind the GameStop's skyrocketing share value, r/WallStreetBets, includes big users of Robinhood who felt they were slighted by the decision. 
The subreddit's Twitter account said the freeze harmed small traders and favored the Wall Street establishment. ""Individual investors are being stripped of their ability to trade on [the Robinhood app],"" the tweet said. ""Meanwhile, hedge funds and institutional investors can continue to trade as normal.""
Robinhood users flooded the Google Play Store and 
  Apple's
 App Store with negative app reviews. There were so many one-star ratings that Google intervened to remove tens of thousands of them. 
There's was also a lawsuit filed on Jan. 28 in the Southern District of New York accusing Robinhood of ""purposefully, willfully, and knowingly removing the stock 'GME' from its trading platform in the midst of an unprecedented stock rise ... deprived retail investors of the ability to invest in the open-market.""
Several members of Congress, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Sen. Ted Cruz, called for a hearing on Robinhood's actions. 
The New York attorney general says she will review what Robinhood did while the Texas attorney general launched an investigation.
And the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the 
  stock market
, released a statement that didn't name Robinhood but said it will ""closely review actions taken by regulated entities that may disadvantage investors or otherwise unduly inhibit their ability to trade certain securities."" 
SEC investigators are already reviewing social media and Reddit posts for any signs of fraud according to a report from Bloomberg. The commission also met with newly appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to discuss the market volatility surrounding GameStop as reported on by Reuters. 
Rep. Maxine Waters, a Democrat from California and chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, held a hearing about Robinhood's actions called Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide. The chief executives of Reddit, Robinhood, Citadel and Melvin Capital, along with the Reddit poster who spearheaded the GameStop buying frenzy, were all in attendance at the hearing through video conferencing.
While the executives were questioned by the committee, not much new information was uncovered in the five hours. 
Following the hearing and a lawsuit by the family of one app user who committed suicide, Robinhood said it would invest in its customer service support. The legal action against the investing platform focuses on how Alex Kearns, a 20-year-old customer, didn't hear back from the company after the app showed he had racked up $730,000 in losses. Robinhood's customer service did eventually respond to the issue and confirmed he didn't owe the money, but it was too late. 
On Feb. 26, Robinhood confirmed it was working with US regulators, state attorneys and the SEC on various inquiries about the company's practices as reported by Yahoo Finance.  
Other investing 
  apps
 and services also had issues with clearing trades similar to Robinhood. Cash App tweeted it would not process trades for AMC and Nokia due to their broker, Axos, halting trades. 
The clearing broker who processes our trades, Axos, has temporarily halted buys of $AMC & $NOK. This was not Cash App’s decision - we disagree with this move wholeheartedly. We hope to make these stocks available for purchase again as soon as possible.
""The clearing broker who processes our trades, Axos, has temporarily halted buys of $AMC & $NOK,"" the company tweeted. ""This was not Cash App's decision -- we disagree with this move wholeheartedly. We hope to make these stocks available for purchase again as soon as possible.""
A Cash App blog post explained further saying that the Depository Trust Company (DTC) informed Axos it would need to significantly increase capital requirements for the trades it would be processing. 
Webull is another investing app that tweeted Jan. 28 it had begun restricting trades on shares of GameStop, AMC and Koss. Webull cited the ""extreme volatility"" of the stocks in limiting user transactions to closing positions. It later removed those restrictions the same day. Webull CEO Anthony Denier said the company's clearing firm also received notice it would need to increase its capital requirements significantly in order to accommodate all the trades, which led to the temporary halt in trading on those volatile stocks. 
TD Ameritrade, another brokerage, said Jan. 27 it would put restrictions on the trading of stocks for GameStop, AMC and others. The brokerage firm confirmed the restrictions, saying it made the decisions ""out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors."" The limits included increasing the amount needed to borrow on margin and limiting other trade options such as short sales. 
Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, E-Trade and Public were other investing services that also limited trading last week because of market volatility.

"Rare Nintendo Switch Lite deal: Get a $20 store credit at Amazon, Best Buy or GameStop",https://www.cnet.com/deals/rare-nintendo-switch-lite-deal-get-a-20-store-credit-at-amazon-best-buy-or-gamestop/,"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"Our expert deal-hunting staff showcases the best price drops and discounts from reputable sellers daily. If you make a purchase using our links, CNET may earn a commission. 

    Discounts on the handheld-only version of the Switch are as rare as the Shiny Charizard.
  
The Nintendo Switch Lite spent so much time out of stock through 2020 that finding it in stock at all seems like something of a minor miracle. That's why it's especially remarkable to find it not just in stock, but accompanied by a $20 promotional credit to boot. Right now at Amazon when you apply promo code 8RLOZI4Z5INC at checkout, you get the Nintendo Switch Lite for $199 along with a $20 credit. All four colors (coral, gray, turquoise and yellow) are available. 
Nintendo's Switch continues to surprise me with how incredibly popular it has become -- it's the little console that could. But keep in mind that while the full-size Switch works both as a fully mobile handheld console and can be plugged into your TV, this model -- the Switch Lite -- can't connect to a display, which is why it's about $100 cheaper. For all the deets, be sure to read CNET's review of the Switch Lite. 
Amazon isn't the only retailer offering a rare Switch Lite deal. You can get a similar offer from Best Buy. Head over there, and you can get the Switch Lite for $200 and a free $20 Best Buy gift card. You can't apply the gift card to the Switch Lite, but it's some free money for your next purchase. 
Finally. the same deal is available at GameStop: Spend $200 on the Switch Lite and get a $20 GameStop gift card. 
If you get a Nintendo Switch Lite before the end of March, both Amazon and Best Buy purchases also include a seven-day free trial of Nintendo Switch Online. At the end of the trial, the subscription kicks in at $4 per month, unless you cancel it first. I'm not sure if GameStop includes the Nintendo Switch Lite free trial, because the product page doesn't mention it.

    Finding Microsoft's new console is hard. Here's the latest on retailers that sell the Series X and Series S.
  
Gamers who have yet to get their hands on the elusive new Xbox Series X have now endured more than five months of frustration. It's always the same: They log on the moment consoles become available at a major retailer like Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, GameStop or Target, and then the entire stock sells out within seconds and they're left empty-handed. Demand for the Xbox Series X continues to outpace supply, partially due to the due to the pandemic, which has lots of people looking for entertainment options they can enjoy at home. This is also one of the reasons the PS5 was recently named the fastest-selling console in US history. 
But don't give up just yet! You see, in recent weeks, we've been seeing more frequent inventory drops at major retailers. And the fact that retailers are announcing Series X and Series S restocks at all means that your chances of snagging a new console are getting better. The $500 Xbox Series X is the game console of choice for its 4K video and 120Hz refresh rates, but if you don't have a 4K TV, the all-digital Xbox Series S is an excellent system and costs a much more reasonable $300.
For the latest news on Xbox console inventory updates, check back here frequently. You can monitor Xbox availability on your own, too: Twitter is a popular (if not entirely reliable) source of Xbox restock rumors. But here at CNET, we occasionally get an update directly from retailers and other tipsters about upcoming inventory restocks, and when we do, we put the word out immediately.    
This much is true: It will probably be months before normal Xbox Series X stock inventory levels appear in major retailer stores, so if you don't put some effort in, getting your own Xbox before summer is likely to be a challenge. Microsoft recently said that it expects inventory to be short through June.   
After this list of related stories, you'll find a list of all the major retailers (and high-profile resellers) where you can monitor Xbox stock updates and availability.
You can find both the Xbox Series X and the less expensive Series S on the same Amazon product page. 
This is the product page for the Xbox Series at GameStop. 
You might also want to visit the retailer's Xbox landing page to see both new consoles, but here's the product page for the Xbox Series X.
If you want to get the latest on the Xbox Series X, there's probably nowhere better than Microsoft's own Xbox Series X homepage.
This is Target's product page for the Xbox Series X. 
This is where you can purchase the Xbox Series X at Newegg when the retailer has inventory. 
Here's where to find the Xbox Series X at Best Buy (when inventory drops).
We highly recommend waiting for inventory to appear at ordinary retailers so you can buy an Xbox Series X at the regular retail price. But if you simply can't wait, be advised that the average Xbox Series X price on eBay is about $800. 
Are you willing to pay a premium of hundreds of dollars over the list price? We don't recommend doing that, but StockX is a reputable eBay-style site that will let you buy a new Xbox -- as long as you're willing to pay $650 or more.

Where to buy a PS5: Everything you need to know about getting Sony's new console,https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/where-to-buy-a-ps5-everything-you-need-to-know-abou-getting-sonys-new-console/,"Sun, 25 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks.

    Finding a PS5 seems impossible right now -- but there are ways to improve your odds.
  
Well, it's been more than five months and so many of the gamers seeking a PS5 are still trapped in a constant cycle of waiting for restocks, logging on at the exact right moment and getting nothing more than a ""sold out"" message for their troubles. You'd think that demand for a gaming system that dropped last November would have waned by now, but high demand, exacerbated by low supply caused by a global chip shortage, has continued to make it difficult for Sony to produce enough consoles for everyone who wants one.
But don't lose hope! Sony's PlayStation Direct has been holding brief restock events almost weekly, and those who continue to queue up for a PS5 might also have a chance to get an email to get into the front of the line. GameStop also continues to receive bundles. And if you're not already on Twitter keeping an eye out for inventory drops at the major retailers, you should be: They're happening more and more often. 
If you're willing to shell out way more than the sticker price, you can get a PlayStation 5 or PS5 bundle at a reseller like eBay or StockX. But our advice is to wait until the console is available at its regular sticker price at retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, GameStop, Target and Walmart. Be sure to check back here often for the latest updates on when retailers might have new console restocks. 
Don't give up trying to get one of these. 
You can monitor PlayStation 5 stock updates on your own; as mentioned above, Twitter is a good source for restock rumors. But we occasionally get word directly from retailers and tipsters about upcoming PS5 console inventory restocks, and we update this post immediately. Again, be aware: It likely could be months before anything approximating normal inventory levels appears in stores, so getting your own PS5 gaming console is likely to be a challenge until summer at the earliest. Below you'll find a list of all the major retailers (and a few high-profile resellers) where you can monitor the video game console's stock and availability.    
You can check out Amazon's page for the $400 Digital Edition via the button below, or, if you'd rather, get in line for the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500.
GameStop offers both the $400 Digital Edition (click the button below) and the pricier PS5 with Blu-ray for $500 (when there is inventory). You should also be able to buy a full range of PS5 accessories from GameStop, like the Pulse 3D wireless headset for $100.
When in stock, Target offers the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500, in addition to the PS5 Digital Edition, which you can find by clicking the button below.
You can check on availability of the $400 Digital Edition at Walmart by clicking the button below, or you can try to snag the pricier PS5 with Blu-ray for $500.
When in stock, Best Buy offers the PS5 with Blu-ray for $500 along with the $400 Digital Edition (which you can find by clicking the button below). The retailer is also offering a slew of accessories on its PS5 landing page.
Newegg doesn't sell PS5 consoles by themselves, just bundles. Still, it does have regular restocks for those who don't mind spending a little extra. 
We don't recommend spending more than retail to get a PS5, but if you must have a console right now, eBay is your shortcut to getting a console. That said, expect to pay hundreds over list; the average PS5 price on eBay is about $800.
If you've exhausted all of the usual retail options and you're willing to pay hundreds over list price, you might want to check out StockX, an eBay alternative that made its name in the secondary market for sneakers and designer clothing. Last time we checked, prices for the PS5 were hovering just below $650. We don't think it's worth it, but let your conscience (and your wallet) be your guide.
This article is regularly updated with the latest PS5 stock news.

Xbox All Access: How to purchase an Xbox Series console for as little as $25 a month,https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/xbox-all-access-how-to-purchase-an-xbox-series-console-for-as-little-as-25-a-month/,"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks.

    Is a payment plan a good option when it comes to buying your next console?
  
Get a new console for a small monthly payment. 
Microsoft's Xbox Series X and Series S consoles launched last November with the PS5 and are still hard to find. What's even harder to find is a retailer that lets you use the monthly installment plan called Xbox All Access. On Wednesday, GameStop held a restock event strictly for those interested in the special payment plan, but as the case has been lately, stock sold out within minutes, following some issues with the site.
Xbox All Access is Microsoft's monthly payment option to purchase a new Xbox Series X or S. Qualified buyers receive the console and 24 months of Game Pass Ultimate for one monthly fee. 
To cut to the chase: If you're already going to buy the hardware and the monthly Game Pass Ultimate subscription, going the All Access route can save you as much as $60 on the total outlay for a Series S and $20 for a Series X over two years. 
Let's take a deeper look at Xbox All Access, including the positives and negatives. 
Microsoft created a payment plan in 2018 to let customers buy an 
  Xbox One X
 or S via monthly installments. Two new plans will be available for the Xbox Series X and S.  
Customers will need to apply for a Citizens One Line of Credit from Citizens Bank at one of the selected retailers. If qualified, they will receive the console of their choice and get access to Game Pass Ultimate. They will then be billed for their selected plan for 24 months at 0% interest.  
That depends on whether or not you have a current subscription to any of the Xbox subscriptions. The more dedicated Xbox gamer likely already subscribes to Game Pass Ultimate with an expiration date that is months after the Series X/S launches, which makes this deal slightly less attractive.  
Aside from them, everyone else interested in a Series X/S could actually benefit from Xbox All Access, as the amount paid over time is less than buying the console and paying the $14.99 subscription for Game Pass Ultimate for 24 months. Moreover, the 0% interest for All Access is a big improvement over the 15% to 22% interest rate you'd get by charging a new $300 to $500 Xbox on your credit card. 
It's $25 a month for 24 months to get the Xbox Series S -- retail price is $300 -- and 24 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. If you want to jump up to the Xbox Series X -- with its retail price of $500 -- that's going to cost $35 a month.  
Game Pass is Microsoft's game subscription service that has more than 100 games available and can be used on both an Xbox and PC. Xbox Live is required for console multiplayer and it comes with two free games a month along with various deals in the Microsoft Store. Both are included in the Game Pass Ultimate subscription.  
No. There are no application fees, annual fees or late fees. All plans come with 0% APY, meaning there is no added interest.  
Here's a breakdown of the total costs of the Xbox All Access for both the Series X and S along with buying the consoles upfront and paying for Game Pass Ultimate for 24 months.  
Something else to keep in mind with this breakdown: Buying a console means you'll most likely have to pay sales tax. That's up to an extra $30-$40 you'll have to pay depending on your state.  
You'll need to provide:  
Yes. The FAQ for the payment plan details that you would need to be approved for a Citizens One Line of Credit from Citizens Bank. When signing up, the bank will do a credit inquiry on you. This means they'll check with the credit agencies to confirm you are credit-worthy. If you are then the bank does a hard credit check, which will show up on your credit report. The bank will also take into account your annual income for the final approval.  
Yes, but not much depending on your actions. To start, credit inquiries, or soft pulls, don't negatively affect your credit score. It will get listed on your credit report as an inquiry, but your score will stay intact. Hard pulls on your credit can show up on your report. There could be a slight drop of five points or less, but they get cleared up in a month or two.  
On the other hand, if you do multiple applications for some reason -- say you get declined and keep trying -- that can show up on your credit report as a negative mark since it looks like you're desperate for credit. Make sure that if you're declined, you do not immediately try again.  
What will cause your credit score to tank considerably is missing a monthly payment. According to the Xbox All Access FAQ, late payments can be reported to the credit bureaus. This will definitely cause a drop in your credit score. Things can get worse if the account is sent to collections for a continued lack of payment.  
Since Microsoft created the All Access program to sell more Xbox One consoles, there are some people who are still paying off their systems when the Xbox Series X and S launch. An upgrade option will be available for those currently on a payment plan that will let them continue their monthly payments with the newer console and trade in the older one as long as they've paid a certain amount off on their Xbox One. All Access customers can check their upgrade status to see where they stand.  "
Xbox lets you play multiplayer games like Destiny 2 for free,https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/xbox-lets-you-play-multiplayer-games-like-destiny-2-for-free/,"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    You no longer need an Xbox Live Gold membership to jump into free-to-play games like Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone and Fortnite.
  
You don't need an Xbox Live Gold membership to join your friends in Destiny 2. By contrast, PlayStation players need a PS Plus subscription for the game's multiplayer.
Microsoft on Wednesday unlocked free-to-play multiplayer games for everyone, meaning you won't need an Xbox Live Gold subscription to dive in. The company revealed the list of games you can try for free and noted that the list will be updated as more titles are released.
In January, Microsoft slammed the brakes on plans to raise the price of Xbox Live Gold memberships, due to social media backlash -- many interpreted the plans as the company trying to push them to upgrade to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, its top subscription service. At the time, Microsoft also promised to remove the Gold requirement from free-to-play games.

Forget Bitcoin: Inside the insane world of altcoin cryptocurrency trading,https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/features/beyond-bitcoin-the-wild-world-of-altcoin-cryptocurrency-trading/,"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
            Bitcoin has reached a dizzying all-time-high of over $63,500, but the world of cryptocurrencies outside of Bitcoin is even more insane.
          
 	It was a Saturday morning in December and Adam was feeling bold.  
He'd made thousands of dollars on a single trade the night before, and was feeling lucky. But Adam wasn't trading on the NASDAQ, pumping GameStop stocks or investing in a startup. He was about to sink $2,500 into a 
  cryptocurrency
 called DeTrade. 
It seemed safe. Adam had investigated the coin's development team on LinkedIn, and watched a video of its CEO laying out a roadmap for the coin's future. A newswire piece published on Yahoo touted DeTrade's technology as advanced enough to disrupt cryptocurrency. 
Bitcoin is very much back in the zeitgeist. On Tuesday, ahead of CoinDesk's listing on the NASDAQ, it reached an all-time-high of over $63,000, exploding almost 10-times in value compared to the same date last year. But while for many people Bitcoin is synonymous with cryptocurrency, it's not what crypto traders like Adam are interested in. Beneath Bitcoin and Ethereum, the second-best-known currency, is a strange underworld of different cryptocurrencies. 
Called altcoins or, sometimes, ""shitcoins,"" these are essentially penny-stock cryptocurrencies. And they're crazy. Bitcoin tripled its value recently, but many altcoins explode 30, 40 or 50 times over within days. The most famous is Dogecoin, which recently shot up past 10 cents thanks to a potent combination of Reddit and Elon Musk, but there are thousands of altcoins, forming an Indiana Jones-esque Cave of Crypto Wonders. The spoils can be life-changing, but there are traps around each corner. Fortunes can be made and lost in seconds. Cons and fraudsters are everywhere, with traders vulnerable to scams at each step of the process.  
Case in point: Adam's foray into DeTrade. The touted technology behind it wasn't real. Nothing about the project was. The LinkedIn profiles were fake, and the video of its CEO was a deepfake created with AI. It was a scam. Those behind it, operating in the unregulated world of crypto, vanished. Adam lost his $2,500, but he got off easy. In total, those behind the scam took in around $2 million.  
Just a regular day playing with altcoins, says Adam. 
Adam got into cryptocurrency last September. When we spoke, it felt like he'd crammed years of trading into two months. He put in $4,000 and lost it in days. Then he turned $3,000 into $90,000. After withdrawing a third of that and then losing just over another third, he now had around $20,000 in crypto.  
Adam had seen some tempestuous trading in the weeks prior to DeTrade. One person managed to flip $2,000 into over $40,000 on two different occasions, but lost it all to scams both times. Another put $150 in a coin and doubled his money in 15 minutes. Decent result, but his $150 would've turned into $28,000 if he'd waited only one more day. He met people in Telegram groups, and was able to track their trades using apps that follow a user's wallet -- a common practice within cryptocurrency circles. 
The community is enthusiastic, but there's a small problem. Right now cryptocurrencies don't really do anything.
Late 2020 saw Bitcoin explode. Bitcoin nearly tripled in price, from $15,000 to over $40,000, in two months. If you invested $1,000 in early November, you could have taken out $2,600 in early February. It's now at over $60,000.
Investing in a stock means ascertaining its value -- based on factors like competition, risks and, above all, profit generation -- and then putting money into ones that are undervalued. If other investors follow you, the stock rises, giving you an opportunity to take profit. 
Speculation is naturally part of this: The Dot-com Bubble was all about pouring money into ""pre-profit"" companies in the hopes they'd make money someday. Cryptocurrency, however, takes speculation into the stratosphere. For the most part, cryptocurrency is pure speculation. People are investing in technology that produces nothing, and as yet has little or no practical application. As I write this, a coin called Meme is selling for over $2,000. That's a little under 15 times the price of an 
  Apple
 share. Doge, a coin marketed after the internet slang for ""dog,"" doubled in value in January after a pornstar tweeted about it. After the price settled, it then rocketed once more when Reddit wanted to make it the GameStop of cryptocurrency.  
This disconnect between price and purpose has made many experts understandably skeptical.  
David Gerard is one such skeptic. He became interested in Bitcoin in 2013, when it first hit $1,000, and has since written two books on cryptocurrency. His most recent focuses on Libra, Facebook's ill-fated attempt at digital currency.  
""The driving force of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is nothing to do with technology,"" he told me during a Skype call. ""It's all about the chance that people might get rich for free. All of this is about the psychology of get-rich-quick schemes.""  
In his years working as an IT systems administrator, Gerard's job has been to examine new technology and discern what's useful and what's not. Cryptocurrency, he told me, is not. 
""Bitcoin burns a whole country's worth of electricity for the most inefficient payment network in human history,"" he said. 
After launching at around $8 in August, the obscure Meme coin briefly reached a valuation of over $1,750 in September. If, with fantastic luck, you invested $1,000 at $8 and sold at $1,750, you'd be up $217,000. This is the allure of ""shitcoins."" 
That's no exaggeration. Cryptocurrencies are mined using powerful computers, and many enterprising types put together farms of computers used solely for the purpose of mining Bitcoin. As a result, Bitcoin is responsible for more energy consumption than Switzerland.  
Gerard says the only thing you can do with Bitcoin is buy it and sell it. He's even harsher on altcoins. 
""They're absolutely useless objects. Even by the standards of Bitcoin, altcoins are useless,"" he said.  
This is precisely what makes them so fascinating. Seemingly, all they can do is get internet punters to bet on their success. But this enables average people to become rich. That Meme coin I mentioned before? It was listed at just over $1 and hit a high of over $4,000 in March. 
Imagine becoming a millionaire from a joke internet coin.  
Crypto Spider -- who, like most people in the cryptocurrency community, goes by a pseudonym -- has made millions with altcoins. 
He's gained renown in some Telegram groups over the past few months thanks to a ""$2K to $1M"" challenge, where he endeavored to see how quickly, and with how few trades, he could turn the first number into the second. In cryptocurrency, you can follow someone's portfolio if you have their wallet number, so the community was able to watch this challenge play out in real time. 
Within two months, that $2,000 had grown to over $2 million. Much of that money was made off one trade: He chucked $50,000 into a project which, in the space of around a week, magnified 35 times in value, netting him $1.75 million. After passing $2 million, he cashed out. 
""You won't ever see that type of explosive growth if you don't trade in altcoins,"" he told me, though he also said ""95% of these coins are going to be nonexistent in the future.""  
Like Adam, Crypto Spider has no background in finance or trading. He lists college courses in game theory, basic algorithmics and some economics as useful to his crypto exploits -- but in essence he's a self-taught amateur. He declined to tell me his specific age, only that he was ""20ish"" when he first got into cryptocurrency in 2017. 
He admits he was attracted by the ""pretty numbers,"" by seeing coins magnify in value 30, 40 and 50 times within a short period. He was enthusiastic enough to start a university club around cryptocurrencies, and how they'd be used in the future.  
Crypto Spider says cryptocurrency will play a ""major part in the future of finance,"" and speaks with the passion of a believer. He breathlessly transitions from how cryptocurrency is a part of the internet's evolution to the possible use cases of 
  blockchain
, the technology behind Bitcoin, in the next 10 years. But despite his enthusiasm, I couldn't help but notice how chunks of what he said echoed Gerard.  
Cryptocurrencies are mined using powerful computers. More emissions are produced by global Bitcoin miners than by the entire country of Switzerland. 
For one thing, he looks back at all the projects he was excited about in 2017 and realizes most were almost entirely vaporware, technology that's advertised but never delivered.  
Gerard calls the cryptocurrency community a pool of scammers. Spider notes that people often invest in altcoins they know don't have a function, because there's enough hype around the project to make money. ""It's a bubble,"" he said, ""we're literally swapping money from each other. I somehow was able to game all the other people.""  
Spider says his performance is 60% luck. He first approached cryptocurrnecy trading with the mentality of, ""I'm young, I'm dumb, I can lose all my money and it'll be OK."" High risk, high reward, a fair attitude. 
Again though, it reminded me of something Gerard said: ""If you're rich enough that your money is your own problem, fine. If you know zero is a number your investment could go to, fine."" 
""But a lot of people are being ripped off, and that's really bad."" 
People really are getting ripped off. Difficult to regulate and subsisting largely on hype, cryptocurrencies are particularly prone to scams. 
Take OneCoin, a company that, through a presale for a cryptocurrency that didn't exist, stole $4 billion from people around the world before its founder disappeared. Then there's BitConnect, a coin that reached a $2.6 billion valuation by promising a 1% return on investment every day. It was eventually designated a Ponzi scheme by various authorities around the globe, causing it to lose 96% of its value before getting shut down months later.  
Those are two of the biggest instances of crypto-fraud. But millions of dollars are scammed from cryptocurrency markets every day in less dramatic ways. Coins are suddenly discontinued, with owners taking all the money with them in what the community calls ""rug pulls."" Some have investment contracts, ignored like terms-of-service agreements, that prohibit you from taking your money out of a project. Other times, entire cryptocurrency exchanges -- which sell coins like a stock exchange sells stocks -- vanish. 
""I think I've been scammed over 100 times,"" Crypto Spider said, adding that he lost $250,000 through fraud in December. ""Who knows who creates these projects. A lot of people are taking on pseudonyms, because they're almost all money grabs.""  
But the deepfake used to scam $2 million adds a new vector. Coming into wider use in recent years, deepfakes are mostly used for pornographic purposes, but as the DeTrade scam shows, deepfakes can also be used in financial scams.  
OneCoin founder Ruja Ignatova at an event for the ""revolutionary"" cryptocurrency. Ignatova disappeared around the time OneCoin was discovered to be a fraud: The cryptocurrency the company sold didn't actually exist. It's reported to have scammed over $4 billion from people around the world. Ignatova has yet to be found.
Gerard says he's never seen a deepfake used as part of a scam before. Crypto Spider says he's seen it just once. 
""We didn't have that problem in 2017, where people would use deepfakes and rug pull like this,"" he said. ""The internet is evolving, but the scammers are also evolving.""  
Deepfake technology ""is being democratized, and that may not be a good thing,"" said Julie Inman-Grant. Now commissioner of the Australian government's eSafety Commission, Inman-Grant formerly led public policy teams at 
  Microsoft
, 
  Adobe
 and Twitter.  
""This kind of takes the art out of social engineering,"" she explained, referring to the techniques usually used by scammers to get you to click a fraudulent link or hand over credit card details. ""If they're delivering a video of someone you respect and you really have no way of telling by the naked eye or ear if it's fake or not, the potential for misuse could be devastating.""  
Ironically, it's blockchain, the behind-the-scenes technology, that could be the solution to the burgeoning deepfake problem. In cryptocurrency, the blockchain is an unalterable ledger that tracks every transaction. Once it's on the ledger, it can't be altered. That same technology can be used to track anything -- like the creation and distribution of a video, from studio to 
  iPhone
 screen. There are already startups working toward this, like Truepic.  
When I asked about blockchain's ability to neutralize deepfakes, Inman-Grant wasn't entirely optimistic.  
""It's definitely an arms race, but it's not an arms race we're winning right now.""  
When Bitcoin hit $40,000 in December, before its Tesla-induced all-time-high, it was confirmation to enthusiasts that cryptocurrency is the future. For skeptics, a higher peak just means a more precipitous fall.  
""I think they'll become increasingly regulated and less and less interesting,"" Gerard said of cryptocurrency. That means less of the ""pretty numbers"" Crypto Spider was attracted to, but hopefully fewer scams. 
For Adam, DeTrade actually had a happy ending. One aggrieved victim of the scam analyzed the metadata of the deepfake, which he used to track down the perpetrators. After some naming and shaming across Telegram, the money was returned.  
That unexpected $2,500 return was a big deal, equivalent to a few weeks pay. Good timing too: By the time Adam got it, a bad trade saw his crypto portfolio diminish from $10,000 to $2,000. 
Just another day trading altcoins, Adam told me. "
Sony's PS5 April update adds new external storage options,https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/sonys-april-update-gives-ps5-new-external-storage-options/,"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    A fix has arrived for the PlayStation 5's storage woes.
  
Running out of room on your PS5? A fix is finally coming. On Tuesday Sony revealed that its April software update will add the ability to store games on external USB drives. 
Sony says the new update, announced in a blog post, will begin ""rolling out globally tomorrow."" While games can be stored on external storage, the company notes that you can't actually play PlayStation 5 games off of external drives. Instead, it envisions this as a quicker way to hot-swap games on the PS5's built-in solid-state drive.

""It is faster to reinstall PS5 games from USB extended storage than to re-download or copy them from a disc,"" Hideaki Nishino, PlayStation's senior vice president of platform planning and management, writes in the post. ""Because PS5 games are designed to take advantage of the console's ultra high-speed SSD, PS5 titles can't be played from USB extended storage.""
Nishino adds that while ""PS5 titles also cannot be directly downloaded to USB extended storage"" the ""games that you transfer or copy back to internal storage will automatically update when applicable.""
Sony's newest console ships with an 825GB SSD, but only around 667GB is actually available to users. With games quickly getting larger in size, gamers can quickly find themselves running out of space with only a few titles on their console. 
Microsoft's Xbox Series X has a 1TB SSD while the Series S sports a 512GB. As with the PS5, Microsoft's consoles don't make all of that storage available to users, but the company does have a special ""Storage Expansion"" slot in the back for easily adding additional space. This (pricey) option mimics the speedy internal storage and allows for not only storing but also playing games, including next-gen titles designed for the Series X or Series S, off the external drive. 
You can also use a traditional USB-connected external hard drive or SSD, but as with the PS5, you won't be able to play next-gen games off of that storage. 
Other new features in the April update include the ability to predownload game updates automatically and ""cross-generation Share Play"" that will allow those on a PS5 to share their screens with friends on PS4. Sony adds that this includes the ability for those on PS4 to be able to ""try out the PS5 games through Share Play"" by virtually passing your controller or playing a co-op game together. "
Xbox consoles have never turned a profit for Microsoft,https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/xbox-consoles-have-never-turned-a-profit-for-microsoft/,"Fri, 07 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNET,"
    An executive confirms that in the Epic v. Apple trial.
  
Microsoft has never turned a profit on Xbox console sales alone, but other aspects of its gaming business make it profitable.

  Microsoft
 has always sold Xbox 
  consoles
 at a loss, an executive confirmed during the Epic Games v. Apple trial on Wednesday, as previously reported by Business Insider. An Epic lawyer asked Microsoft's vice president of Xbox business development, Lori Wright, about what profit margins the company has on its sales of console units.
""We don't -- we sell the consoles at a loss,"" she replied, before confirming that Microsoft has never earned a profit on console sales.
Microsoft has been making games consoles since the original Xbox in 2001. It released the Xbox Series X and S last November.
It's not an unusual strategy for companies to sell consoles at a loss -- they typically act as a loss leader for sales of games, accessories and subscription services. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed that via email.
""With more than 23 game studios creating games, more than 100 million monthly active Xbox players, and more than 18 million Xbox Game Pass subscribers across console, mobile, and PC, the gaming business is a profitable and high-growth business for Microsoft,"" they wrote in a statement. ""The console gaming business is traditionally a hardware subsidy model. Game companies sell consoles at a loss to attract new customers. Profits are generated in game sales and online service subscriptions.""
The cost of making consoles tends to drop over their lifespan, but companies cut the retail prices of their consoles as well.

    Where can you find Nvidia's entry-level RTX 3000-series GPU in stock? We're monitoring inventory at these and other stores to alert you when it becomes available.
  
On the hunt for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3000 series graphics card? Get in line. Between the pandemic that forced people to stay home and game more and the explosion in cryptocurrency mining, demand is sky high for Nvidia's new Ampere GPU. Finding a new RTX 3000 card is next to impossible; the GeForce RTX 3060, RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070, RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 have been perpetually out of stock since they were released. You'd have better luck tracking down a PS5 or locating an Xbox Series X console than finding a new RTX GPU for your gaming rig.
Nvidia is not deaf to your cries for an RTX 3000 series GPU. It tweaked the RTX 3060's driver to discourage crypto miners from snatching up the card and will soon release new versions of the higher-end cards with the same restriction. Labeled as ""Lite Hash Rate"" or LHR cards, they will will throttle back performance if they detect that you are mining using the Ethereum algorithm. Fear not, gamers: These cards will run at full speed for games. The new LHR cards will begin shipping in late May.
A GeForce RTX 3060 graphics card is harder to find than a PS5 or Xbox Series X.
Despite Nvidia's efforts to get the RTX 3060 into the hands of gamers from the start, it's out of stock everywhere -- along with the rest of its RTX 3000-series siblings. You can find it on eBay or StockX, but be prepared to pay three or four times its $330 retail price. If you aren't willing to shell out $1,000 and up for an RTX 3060, then keep this page bookmarked. 
To aid your efforts in finding an RTX 3060 card that's actually in stock and available to purchase, we've linked below to product listing pages of the major retailers for the cards from the various manufacturers -- namely Asus, EVGA, Gigabyte, MSI, PNY and Zotac. There is no Founders Edition of the card from Nvidia, but you can check Nvidia's site to see the different flavors of the RTX 3060 sold by its partners and check inventory.
You can also sign up for Discord's Stock Informer and get alerts on your phone when a card is in stock. You'll have to act fast when a notification appears -- there are currently more than 50,000 Stock Informer members -- but it will let you keep your finger on the next-gen GPU pulse.

There are many variants of the RTX 3060 across the manufacturers, but the biggest differentiators are the size/length of the card determined by whether it has two or three cooling fans. In addition, there are OC versions of the RTX 3060 that are factory-overclocked (making them faster) and therefore pricier. 
RTX 3060 (starts at $330): This is the baseline model -- running at stock speeds and cooled by two fans.
RTX 3060 OC (starts at $480 to $550): This is the factory-overclocked version, which often sports three fans.
Best Buy and Newegg have the most product listings for the RTX 3060, followed by B&H, while Amazon has very few and GameStop has even fewer. Again, there are currently no RTX 3060 cards in stock at any of these retailers, with the exception of a few exceptionally overpriced cards on Amazon; you can do better on eBay and StockX.
We will update this story as soon as we find any retailer with inventory of any of the cards from any manufacturer. Until then, you can click about and check for yourself in the hopes that you time it just right and find an RTX 3060 suddenly in stock. We'll keep this story up to date.

Here are your best bets for finding the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 at national retailers.
The baseline RTX 3060 starts at $390 at Best Buy, but the retailer has nothing in stock at the time of this writing.
Newegg has the most listings for RTX 3060 cards. Pricing starts at $330 but nothing is currently in stock.
B&H has RTX 3060 OC product listings that start at $460 but nothing in stock at the moment.
The GeForce RTX 3060 Ti is one rung up on the RTX 3000 series ladder from the RTX 3060. With a retail price of $400, it costs $70 more than the entry-level RTX 3060. The RTX 3060 Ti has more cores and a larger memory pipe than the RTX 3060 and draws a bit more power. The RTX 3060 actually has more memory (12GB versus 8GB) and a higher boost clock speed (1.8GHz versus 1.7GHz) than the RTX 3060 Ti, but its smaller memory pipe (192-bit versus 256-bit) gives the performance edge to the RTX 3060 Ti. 
One other difference between the two? There's a Founders Edition of the GeForce RTX 3060 Ti.
Both cards deliver excellent value, but the RTX 3060 Ti is the better pick if you want fast frame rates at 1440p.
Best Buy has a handful of listings for the RTX 3060 Ti but nothing currently in stock. Pricing starts at $400.
Newegg has numerous listings for RTX 3060 Ti cards. Pricing starts at $500 but nothing is currently in stock.
B&H has a fair number of RTX 3060 TI product listings that start at $400 but nothing in stock at the moment."
