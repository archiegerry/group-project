If you're reading this, that means you managed to make it through the stock market's most absurb week in recent memory. You'll always remember where you were when Reddit day traders banded together and pumped 90's nostalgia stocks like GameStop to the moon — an unprecedented uprising that sent ripples through every layer of the financial system.
The story starts, of course, with the traders themselves, who conduct their business on r/WallStreetBets subreddit. They threw the exact perfect mix of market savvy, anti-establishment sentiment, and sheer will into a blender and came out with a destabilizing cocktail that left established Wall Streeters scrambling clean up the mess.
The central concept was relatively simple: focus on buying heavily shorted stocks, which will hopefully squeeze those positions until they're forced to close, pushing the stock up even further. Ideally that inspires people that feel left out to pile in. Rinse, repeat. That these companies — which included Nokia, BlackBerry, and BB Liquidating (formerly known as Blockbuster) — were nostalgic, past-their-prime businesses was an added bonus to the Reddit crowd, who are never ones to pass up a chance at irony.
But the phenomenon goes far deeper than that. Underlying the memes and the hubris rests an anti-establishment streak. For a portion of the WallStreetBets crowd, this undertaking isn't just about making money. It's about making Old Wall Street pay, and the group isn't exactly being coy about that fact. ""It seems Occupy Wall Street had the wrong approach,"" the official WallStreetBets Twitter account posted on January 26.
So what's the damage look like on Wall Street so far? Arguably the biggest casualty has been Melvin Capital, which held a short position on GameStop that's left them down 53% year-to-date — performance so bad that investing titans Steve Cohen and Ken Griffin have had to bail them out. 
But it hasn't been all negative. Silver Lake Partners saw a convertible-debt investment strike gold when AMC Entertainment's stock surged this past week. The firm was able to flip that debt into stock, which it then sold at the peak for a smooth $113 million profit. Some have called it the ""trade of a lifetime.""
Then there's also the matter of the preferred trading platform for the Reddit army: Robinhood. The online brokerage had a week for the ages after restricting further buying of GameStop, then backtracking after backlash from everyone from AOC to Chamath Palihapitiya. There have also been reports that Robinhood was forced to draw on bank credit lines amid the madness. How this impacts the company's quest to go public this year will be a story to watch in the coming weeks.
So where do we go from here? One thing to watch is how hedge funds react. They were already shedding equity exposure in the early days of the GameStop craze, and it's possible the market dislocations exploited by Redditors will cause them to retreat further.
Many other questions remain. Who else was caught short and ultimately doomed by WallStreetBets? Who else raked in big returns like Silver Lake? When will the so-called meme stocks come plunging back down to earth? And will the stock market ever be the same? Keep watching this space to find out the answer to those, plus many more.
Join us Tuesday, February 2, 2021 at 1:00 p.m ET as deputy editor Joe Ciolli, markets and economy reporter Ben Winck, and senior investing reporter Vicky Huang discuss the GameStop phenomenon, the influence of WallStreetBets, and how the Reddit-fueled trade might end.

Ally Chief Investment Strategist Lindsey Bell says the meme-stock rally could be a good thing for average investors. Still, she says traders who want to play the newest hot stocks should understand they are speculating. Bell also advises investors to have a plan and stick to it when things get strange, and understand how unusual this time is.

The Reddit-fueled trading phenomenon lifting GameStop, AMC, and other stocks is backed by populist sentiments. Cries to dethrone the establishment and redistribute wealth resemble those seen at Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. The trend has all but certainly formed a bubble, but its political messaging can still live on.

"The history of WallStreetBets, the Reddit group that upended the stock market with a campaign to boost GameStop",https://www.businessinsider.com/wallstreetbets-reddit-history-gme-gamestop-stock-dow-futures-yolo-2021-1,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Over the past week, stocks in GameStop, AMC theaters, and a multitude of other seemingly fading companies have soared in value. For stockbrokers and traders, these massive price hikes seem like an anomaly — but those plugged into the online forum Reddit aren't shocked. The spikes follow a targeted wave of enthusiasm aiming to boost the stock valuations from members of the subreddit r/wallstreetbets.
For many, the GameStop rally might be the first time they've heard of the community, but r/wallstreetbets is actually a relatively old subreddit with deep ties to internet culture.
The language used on posts in the community can be crude and boorish — they describe themselves as ""autists"" and proudly exclaim how little they know about the market. But if you can move past the crass outer shell, you can find an almost-coherent community of like-minded individuals who want to flip off the hedge fund managers and make money for the little guy. 
r/WallStreetBets has become a new training ground for would-be investors, aided by apps like Robinhood and WeBull that allow anyone with a bank account to become a trader. But how did this sub grow to nearly 5 million self-described ""degenerates"" and inspire scrutiny from the SEC?
The WallStreetBets subreddit was created in 2012 by Jaime Rogozinski while he was working as an information technology consultant for the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, DC according to the Wall Street Journal. The 39-year-old who lives in Mexico City found that while visiting internet forums in the early 2010s, he would be told by fellow investors that his investing style ""akin to gambling"" wasn't going to work out. 
""When I created the sub, I was looking for a community, a place for people to talk about high-risk trades in an unapologetic way for people to make some short term money with disposable income,"" Rogozinski told TMZ Live on Wednesday. ""The progression of WallStreeBets throughout the years has been nothing short of amazing."" 
 
Over the next few years, r/wallstreetbets remained fairly small and niche. According to subreddit stats, the sub didn't break 100,000 subscribers until 2017. During these early years, the sub was still trying to find its identity but it still had notable events.
Martin Shkreli, the ""pharma bro"" who is serving a seven-year prison sentence for securities fraud, was a common voice on the sub and a moderator. In June 2016, he proposed a ban on the word ""YOLO,"" meaning ""you only live once"" because the ""term undermines the central point of investing"" and ""this 'roll the dice' mentality is amateurish: I have never heard it in 15 years on Wall Street.""
The ""YOLO"" mentality of buying whatever is a crucial theme on the sub and is still commonly seen today. 
By 2020, the sub had ballooned to over a million subscribers and was full of novice traders sharing their gains, losses, and memes. Rogozinski published a book about his experience in January and in March announced the ""Wall Street Bet Championship."" This trading competition was to be held at the Esports Stadium Arlington and featured 12 contestants that would each put in $50,000. The event was sponsored by the True Trading Group, with moderator StormWillPass posting that users that want to talk ""negatively"" about the company will be ""banned."" 
 
This caused quite a bit of drama on the sub, with users finding connections between the moderators and the True Trading Group. According to the Daily Dot, moderator Arigold212855 appeared to admit in a leaked private message that ""TTG gave WSB 6 figures to back them"" and that they are a ""part owner of TTG."" In April of 2020, the sub mysteriously went private only for it to unprivate itself briefly to post a message from the moderators.
""WSB has been liberated,"" wrote mod ITradeBaconFutures. ""The OG mods are working to get the band back together with those that were run off.""
According to a message posted on the WallStreetBets Discord, Rogozinski had been removed as a moderator because ""he was found to be attempting to sell rights to the subreddit to a cut-rate trading team called 'True Trading Group.'"" When users tried to visit the sub, the message confirmed the founder's ousting. 
There's no record the Wall Street Bets Championship took place after the controversy. 
With an unshackled group of moderators, r/WallStreetBets was about to reach entirely new heights.
By mid-2020, constant posts about money made from Tesla trades and meme stocks, investments made that don't make sense by traditional metrics but simply catch-on online,  created a new gold rush, where users wanted to jump on that bandwagon to financial stability.  User ETHBAGHOLDER claimed that they turned $3,000 into $102,000 by taking investment advice from the sub. Another user, osbetel, claimed he turned $5,000 into over $300,000 by investing in Tesla. Deepf---ingValue has become a bit of a folk hero, posting daily updates on his ""YOLO"" stocks that he says he's invested nearly a million dollars into. 
By December of 2020, the sub had grown to 1.8 million subscribers and was full of screenshots of the app Robinhood, one of the more popular apps used to invest. 
In January 2021, with the pandemic raging and financial instability abound, the sub grew to previously unimaginable heights. It gained over two million subscribers in a few days and, and now has the most comments and posts created in one day on the entirety of Reddit according to subredditstats.
Thousands of new users flocked to the sub after users successfully popped the valuation of several stocks, including GameStop. Last week, GameStop stock was worth $40 but due to the purchasing efforts of the members of r/wallstreetbets, it ballooned to a high of $492. Purchasing power usually reserved for hedge funds was now in the hands of the people.
The subreddit's Discord server was banned on Wednesday, with the company telling The Verge that they ""decided to remove the server and its owner from Discord for continuing to allow hateful and discriminatory content after repeated warnings."" 
""We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad,"" mod zjz wrote in a post after the ban. ""Discord did us dirty and I am not impressed with them destroying our community.""
The sub has now gone mainstream, with even their idol Elon Musk tweeting about WallStreetBets. Robinhood and other trading apps have halted trading on GameStop stocks and the traditional world of money is having to come to terms with this ragtag group of users changing the shape of modern investing.

Rep. Ro Khanna slams Robinhood's move to restrict trading on stocks,https://www.businessinsider.com/ro-khanna-slams-robinhood-trading-restriction-reddit-traders-amc-gamestop-2021-1,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"A prominent House Democrat slammed Robinhood's move to restrict trading on some stocks like Gamestop and endorsed the idea of holding a congressional hearing on the popular trading app's decision.
Rep. Ro Khanna, a leading member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said there was ""visceral anger"" at hedge funds for their role propelling economic inequality in the United States. 
""Everyone on Robinhood should have equal access for trading,"" Khanna said in an interview with Insider. ""They can't just shut down trading for retail investors and not hedge funds.""
He urged additional regulations on Wall Street such as tougher rules on short-selling and a financial transactions tax, which is a levy on the buying and selling of stocks. President Joe Biden endorsed one during the 2020 campaign.
Khanna, a third-term Democrat, also backed Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez's call on Thursday to hold a hearing.
""We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit,"" the New York congresswoman said in a Thursday tweet. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas supported her statement, despite their repeated sparring online.
Over the past few days, a large group of ordinary investors have banded together to take on powerful Wall Street hedge funds. Those investors — many forming part of the popular Reddit forum r/WallStreetBets — have spurred eye-popping gains for shares of heavily shorted stocks like Gamestop, AMC, and Nokia.
But many of those stocks plunged on Thursday after Robinhood curbed trading for users, who could only sell their shares but not buy additional ones. The step triggered fierce criticism from lawmakers as well as on social media.

Here's what happening inside some GameStop stores across the country,https://www.businessinsider.com/heres-what-happening-inside-some-gamestop-stores-across-the-country-2021-1,"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"As shares of GameStop stock reached sky-high levels on Tuesday and Wednesday before dramatically falling on Thursday, one group of people has been left firmly on the ground, fielding bizarre interactions with customers: GameStop store employees.
As an army of day traders sent the stock soaring, workers at some GameStop stores across the country told Insider that they were receiving calls and even in-person visits from customers. But the inquiries weren't always looking for the latest video games. Instead, they wanted some investment advice. 
Meanwhile, employees said, they had yet to receive any direct guidance from the company's leadership about how to address the stream of customer questions. 
Dwight, a GameStop senior sales advisor who was working at GameStop's store on Mission Street in San Francisco and withheld his last name, told Insider by phone on Wednesday evening that some employees have been left to their own devices while fielding incoming calls from quizzical customers.
""I've definitely been getting calls about it,"" Dwight said, noting that ""random customers"" were seeking counsel on how to invest their funds with the company. ""People [are] asking whether or not they should move forward with getting the stock,"" Dwight added.

As to his response to some of those puzzled callers: ""I'm sorry, dude,"" he said. ""I have no insight on this.""
Others made passing comments about the once-soaring stock while paying for their items, according to one employee at a location in South Florida, who requested anonymity to speak freely about unfolding events.  
They made remarks like: ""You guys must be doing pretty well, the way your stock's going up,"" the associate said, adding that those comments don't quite speak to the full picture. 
""My coworkers and I have just been annoyed with people coming in and asking us if they should buy stock or not,"" this person said. ""We haven't ever been offered stock.""
GameStop store associates at multiple locations across the country told Insider that they had not received any communications from GameStop's corporate leadership about the stock surge as of Thursday afternoon or how to handle the unique customer interactions. 
A GameStop representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Insider on Thursday afternoon.
When reached by phone on Thursday, Bruno — a store associate who works at GameStop in Miami-Dade County, Fla., who withheld his last name — told Insider that store associates hadn't received any formal messaging on this subject from corporate executives.
Bruno was unable to specify whether managers, however, had been contacted by GameStop leadership. 
To be sure, the unique interactions were not universal. Other GameStop store employees didn't report any unusual behavior from customers.

Meanwhile, some interactions have been more confrontational over the volatile stock price. 
""I had multiple people come in and tell me that I ruined their portfolio,"" said the South Florida associate.
Frustrated customers made comments along the lines of: ""My portfolio got screwed because of GameStop stock,"" this person said.

The 4 main reasons that GameStop stock became the target of a Reddit forum with more than 2 million members,https://www.businessinsider.com/why-gamestop-stock-reddit-wallstreetbets-2021-1,"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The absurd, sudden leap in GameStop stock value has nothing to do with game consoles. 
GameStop shares have skyrocketed 1,200% since mid-January, when members of the Reddit forum r/wallstreetbets began advocating that others buy stock in the ailing video game retailer. In the past two weeks alone, GameStop stock has leaped nearly 1,000% — past $325 a share as of Wednesday afternoon from about $30.
So, what's going on? Why is a community of Redditors suddenly going all in on GameStop's stock? 
Here are the four reasons Redditors are sending GameStop to the moon:
In early 2019, GameStop's stock value fell off a cliff: It dropped under $4 a share from about $16, and it stayed in that range for just shy of two years.
Even in 2020, while the video game business (including GameStop) had huge gains during coronavirus lockdowns, GameStop's stock price remained in the gutter. As recently as August — just under five months ago — the largest video game retail chain had a stock value of less than $5 a share.
But in the second half of 2020, with big financial names like Michael Burry and Ryan Cohen buying up shares in the ailing retailer, and new game consoles arriving from Sony and Microsoft, things started looking up. The company's share value gradually increased until it surpassed its pre-collapse value in late 2020.
By early January, there were a lot of signs that buying GameStop stock was a good idea. By mid-January, users of a Reddit forum named r/wallstreetbets began buying up stock in the company — the more they bought, the higher the price went, in a kind of modern bull raid. The group has over 2 million members and uses its collective buying power to move stock prices.
The reason Wall Street Bets traders gambled on GameStop, however, had less to do with the company's business model and more with seeking to embarrass institutional short-sellers — including the Citron Research managing partner Andrew Left.
Short-sellers make money by betting on stock prices to fall.
Left and the Wall Street Bets forum had feuded in the past over his shorts on Palantir Technologies and the Chinese carmaker Nio, per Bloomberg.
Just before GameStop erupted, Left posted a nearly seven-minute video explaining why he expected shares to crash. He further provoked Wall Street Bets by calling GameStop buyers ""suckers at this poker game.""
Members of Wall Street Bets ridiculed Left and used his video as fuel to keep buying GameStop, Insider's Ben Winck reported.
Left has since ended all comment on GameStop after saying he was harassed, and he's said his hedge fund covered most of its GameStop short positions at a 100% loss.
As with past memes, buying shares of GameStop spread from person to person through Reddit and other social-media communities.
Markets writers define ""meme stocks"" as those that experience wild swings after online posts lead a mass of people to buy or sell. These movements to stock price have little to do with company financials or news.
GameStop's buyers probably aren't true believers in the future of physical video game sales — they're buying the stock to make a big return and, perhaps more important, to demonstrate power.
The prevailing theme of posts on Wall Street Bets is collective power — enough collective power to push back on the hedge funds and analysts who predicted GameStop's stock would never reach such heights.
There's another theme as well: A grand bet, to ""hold on tight"" and not sell, no matter how high the stock's value goes. ""GME will stay going until WE sell. Do not f---ing sell boys, $1,000 was the original target but nothing is stopping this from getting to $5,000 but us.""
Ryan Cohen, the cofounder and former CEO of the pet-product firm Chewy, accumulated over 12% of GameStop by December. Cohen hoped to expand GameStop's e-commerce arm and rescue it from years of slumped sales because of increased competition from digital game stores. 
On January 11, before r/wallstreetbets went all in on buying GameStop, Cohen announced two former Chewy lieutenants would join the gaming store's board of directors. GameStop shares jumped following the news after Cohen promised to overhaul the struggling retailer with digital sales.
The Chewy cofounder has reportedly made a 1,700% return from his 2020 investment of $76 million after GameStop's improbable rally. Cohen is now a billionaire, according to Forbes.

GameStop: 'Wolf of Wall Street' warns small investors to 'be careful',https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-wolf-wall-street-warns-small-investors-to-be-careful-2021-1,"Sun, 31 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Reddit day traders have recently rebelled against Wall Street short-sellers, dramatically driving up video game retailer GameStop's stock price.
As a result, hedge funds and other Wall Streeters that shorted the retailer have lost billions.
""It's shocking, really amazing, and gratifying to see a little bit of the pain going on the side of the hedge funds,"" Jordan Belfort told Sky News. ""The hedge funds have been beating up little investors since the beginning of time pretty much.""
Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio in Marin Scorcese's ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" told the broadcaster that he wishes he'd come up with this strategy outsmart hedge fund managers.
Read more: The SEC is monitoring the GameStop trading frenzy. Here's why lawyers and former regulators say clamping down on the market will be tough.
But the stockbroker, who was jailed for 22 months for fraud and stock-market manipulation, is also urging small investors to tread carefully. 
""While this will be short-lived… everyone's got to be really careful because it's going to be like catching a falling knife when it unravels,"" he told Sky News.
""The danger is that Wall Street and hedge funds especially are experts at identifying what we call 'inefficiencies in the market,'"" Belfort went on.
""This is an inefficiency in the market right now and they will look to close that inefficiency very quickly,"" he added.
In his interview with Sky News, Belfort recognized the potentially lucrative appeal for small investors choosing to buy shares in GameStop.
""It's a wonderful opportunity for people to make money — everyone's bored and locked up — but just be careful and make sure whatever you invest in these type of hot stocks, make sure you invest only what you can afford to lose,"" he told the broadcaster.
""If you happen to make money, pull the original investment out and play with the house's money. That's my advice to everybody,"" Belfort added.

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev denies liquidity issues: CNBC,https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-ceo-defends-gamestop-amc-nokia-trading-restrictions-2021-1,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev shot down speculation on Thursday about the company's finances, telling CNBC's Aaron Ross Sorkin ""there was no liquidity problem.""
The rumors arose after Bloomberg reported Robinhood had borrowed ""at least several hundred million dollars"" from banks amid the recent trading frenzy on its platform.
""In terms of the credit lines,"" Tenev told CNBC, ""that was really a proactive measure.""
""We pulled those credit lines so that we could maximize, within reason, the funds we have to deposit at the clearing houses,"" he added, referring to regulations that require brokerage firms like Robinhood to have a minimum amount of money deposited with financial clearinghouses at all times.
""Some of these requirements fluctuate quite a bit based on volatility in the markets, and they can be substantial in the current environment where there's a lot of volatility and a lot of concentrated activity in these names that have been going viral on social media,"" Tenev said.
Those names include GameStop, AMC Theaters, Nokia, and other stocks that have been the target of short-squeezes, largely sparked by the online community r/WallStreetBets, a group of mostly retail traders that helped drive share prices up — and in doing so, caused short sellers to lose billions of dollars on their positions.

As trading activity spiked, Robinhood temporarily blocked people from buying those stocks, outraging customers, one of whom filed a class-action lawsuit Thursday.
Tenev defended the restrictions, telling CNBC that Robinhood has always stood for ""everyday investors ... opening up access and giving them the ability to trade commission-free in whatever they want.""
""I know how Clorox and Lysol felt in the pandemic when they were running out of hand sanitizer and supplies,"" he added. ""We just haven't seen this level of concentrated interest market-wide in a small number of names before.""
The move also drew criticism from the broader retail investor community, several progressive lawmakers including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ro Khanna, regulators, and even Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a popular figure among r/WallStreetBets members.
Democrats in Congress have said they will hold at least two hearings about Wall Street's practices following the GameStop short-squeeze.
The trading frenzy this week has ignited a larger debate about how financial markets should be regulated and what will happen to the sky-high prices of companies like GameStop.
When asked by Sorkin whether he believes these stocks are ""divorced from reality,"" Tenev replied: ""I think people need to be informed. They need to be educated. We do want to give them the ability to do that, but I also believe that, access is a very powerful thing. The more individual investors have access to the markets, the better off we will be.""

"The GameStop, Wall Street Bets Reddit thing isn't funny; it's stupid",https://www.businessinsider.com/the-gamestop-wallstreetbets-reddit-thing-isnt-funny-its-stupid-2021-1,"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"There is this bizarre narrative that the Reddit-driven GameStop stock bubble amounts to a way for ordinary investors to ""stick it to the man"" by causing some hedge funds to lose money — that those funds have been taught a lesson for selling short. Like GameStop's current share price, this narrative doesn't make any sense.
As of this writing, GameStop's share price of about $340 gives it a market capitalization of roughly $23 billion. For comparison, Best Buy is worth $29.5 billion. But Best Buy is a far larger enterprise — it has about three times as many employees as GameStop — and more importantly, Best Buy makes money. It earned profits of $1.5 billion in 2019, while GameStop lost $471 million.
The original, putative theory behind the Reddit-driven push to buy GameStop was that the company had a good turnaround plan and would successfully shift to online game sales and start making money again. Whatever the merits of that theory when the markets valued GameStop at less than $1 billion, it's out the window at a market cap of $23 billion. Even with a turnaround and rosy expectations of profits from the GameStop business, the valuation of the company at this point is not justified by business fundamentals.
Given the divorce of the price from the underlying business, GameStop's stock has been turned into a purely speculative asset, like a cryptocurrency. 
Read more: How hedge funds are tracking Reddit posts to protect their portfolios after the Wall Street Bets crowd helped tank Melvin Capital's short positions
Yes, some hedge funds lost money, and a lot of retail investors are up, for now. But they can't access those gains until they sell. When they sell, the price of GameStop will fall, and the retail investors who bought late will lose money because there's no fundamental reason for other people to buy in at such a high price.
And why should we assume the net losses on this price roller coaster will accrue to institutional investors? Some shorts got popped with the run-up in GameStop, but a fading, money-losing business with a sudden market cap over $20 billion for no good reason is surely attractive to new short sellers, who will gain as the new retail buyers lose.
If GameStop is overvalued by $20 billion right now, that's $20 billion of losses waiting to accrue, largely to ordinary investors who got caught up in a fad. And while some of the traders have gotten cheered for buying at the top by their internet friends, this is far from a desirable democratization of Wall Street — this is just a new way for regular people to lose their shirts.
Before you call me a ""crybaby loser"" whose short position blew up — as a number of you have been doing on Twitter for the past couple of days — I want to be clear: I don't do any short investing, which is prohibited anyway by Insider policies. This rule is so that I can call you an idiot from a position of objectivity. I have never had any financial interest in GameStop, except for the very small long position I hold because of my ownership of total market index funds. My shirt is not the one getting lost here.
And who decided short selling was a bad thing? Shorts play a valuable role: They help identify companies that aren't worth what they appear to be, so those companies don't waste more of investors' money.
I realize shorts seem like huge spoilsports and killjoys for betting against the futures of specific businesses. But the purpose of the stock market is to allocate capital to productive businesses so that useful investments are made in the real economy. It doesn't always work perfectly, but fomenting irrational froth in businesses with no fundamental reason to soar in value makes the markets only less effective at that goal, while short campaigns against overvalued companies make it more effective.
""Short sellers have alerted us to problems in companies before the government and others did, like at Enron,"" said Jason Furman, a professor of practice of economic policy at Harvard and former chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.
Shorts more recently helped reveal the financial fraud at Wirecard — over the objection of German regulators who defended the payments company when short sellers accused it of accounting shenanigans.
If you want to see what a market without short selling looks like, look at the private markets, which have in recent years blown bubbles public investors wouldn't tolerate, like at WeWork and Theranos. If it had been possible to sell Theranos stock short, maybe it wouldn't have taken a decade to figure out the company didn't have a product.
I understand people feel frustrated by low interest rates, which mean you can't park money in a risk-free asset and earn a significant return. This encourages investors to seek risk.
But the idea that retail investors have been deprived of the opportunity to make real money through vanilla investments isn't true. If you bought broad stock funds three months ago or a year ago or five years ago, you've done quite nicely. And since the GameStop speculators by definition are people who had some money to put in the stock market, that avenue was available to them. So the idea that these people — bored people with money — are a downtrodden class engaged in a righteous fight against Wall Street just doesn't wash.
The best thing to do to improve returns to vanilla investments that are appropriate for retail investors is to improve the long-run growth of the economy. And I do have one note of sympathy for the investors who complain there's no yield to be had without nonsense like this.
One reason to favor a significant fiscal stimulus package (besides that it will provide relief to the sort of people who don't have money sitting around to throw at Reddit investing trends) is that if it ""overheats"" the economy — tightening the labor market and causing prices to rise — that might tend to push interest rates up. This is not a switch the Fed itself can just decide to throw; rates are low because growth expectations are low. But boosting demand and output can boost those growth expectations and make higher rates appropriate again.
And in addition to increasing the return on safe assets, a rise in interest rates would, hopefully, take the gas out of investing bubbles, like this especially ridiculous one.

"Hedge funds, data companies tracking Wall Street Bets' tickers closely",https://www.businessinsider.com/hedge-funds-data-reddit-tracking-wallstreetbets-tickers-gamestop-short-yolo-2021-1,"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Retail investors — especially from the subreddit Wall Street Bets — helped force one of the top-performing hedge funds of the past half-decade to secure billions in emergency funding from two ultracompetitive peers. 
Now funds are planning to keep as close of an eye as possible on the social-media platform, angling to not just avoid getting burned but also extract insights and capitalize on other shifts in stocks the Reddit crowd is focused on.
One data scientist at a fund told Insider they created a scraping tool this weekend to monitor tickers being discussed on the site to make sure their fund's short book isn't caught in the next ""YOLO"" trade, parlance on the subreddit for a high-stakes wager, often involving stock options. Thinknum, a web-scraping data provider, is in the process of building a Reddit-specific dataset after ""insane client demand,"" according to cofounder Justin Zhen. The new tool will track ticker mentions in certain subreddits including Wall Street Bets.
The rapidly growing subreddit, now with over 2.4 million members, maintains a dashboard of data insights, and other users have created tools of their own to make sense of the metadata from Reddit's stock-investing community.
Meanwhile, Eagle Alpha, which connects hedge-fund clients to alternative-data providers, has noticed an increase in demand for data on retail investors this month, with a specific focus on Reddit. Interest in this data originally started in the fourth quarter of last year, in part because Robinhood cut off the trading data that many funds were using, but Hugh O'Connor, Eagle Alpha's global director of data sourcing and partnerships, said ""there's been a surge in interest in requests that have come in the last month.""
Read more: Bloomberg just paid more than $100 million for an upstart alt-data player. Here's why that marks a huge turning point for a once-fringe business.
The talk of Wall Street this week has been the meteoric rise of shares in GameStop, the video-game retailer that had been struggling thanks to the pandemic and a shift to buying games directly on consoles, and a big stumble by Melvin Capital, led by the onetime golden boy Gabe Plotkin.
Plotkin's fund had big bets against GameStop, which became a favorite of the Wall Street Bets crowd thanks in part to Chewy founder Ryan Cohen's addition to the company board. Melvin's puts against GameStop were revealed in regulatory filings, putting the fund and select others like the short seller Citron Research in the crosshairs of the subreddit. GameStop has soared, and Cohen's 12.9% stake in the company had swelled to more than $1.3 billion as of Tuesday's trading close. 
Melvin is down at least 30% this year, according to The Wall Street Journal, thanks in part to GameStop but also because of a slew of other losing short bets, including National Beverage and Bed Bath & Beyond.
Plotkin, whose fund returned more than 50% last year and managed $12.5 billion heading into the year, received $2.75 billion on Monday for a nonvoting revenue stake in his manager from Citadel founder Ken Griffin and Plotkin's former boss Steve Cohen.
The swift reversal of fortunes for Melvin at the hands of a horde of contrarian day traders has captivated the investment community, which is now looking to profit from a new stream of alternative data: stocks Redditors are coalescing around and plowing their growing pile of capital toward.
The Wall Street Bets ranks have ballooned this year, especially as the group's wager on GameStop has produced eye-popping returns — the stock is up over 750% in 2021 — and upended pedigreed finance professionals. The subreddit has added more than half a million members in January, growing from 1.8 million to 2.4 million as of Tuesday.
It has added more than 25,000 users in the past 24 hours, according to the metadata dashboard run by the subreddit, which shows insights on the most discussed companies, comments and posts, and top users posting about individual companies. 
Another live-feed dashboard created months ago by the Reddit user Eric Schwelgin, whose handle on the website is weare808, monitors stock-ticker mentions across the website and filters them by shifts in popularity and includes a drop-down menu for each stock showing the latest Reddit comments about the company.
Schwelgin, a developer from outside Cleveland, told Insider he built the tool, called ""Dayminer,"" in October as a quarantine side project and received positive initial reviews and feedback from the Reddit community. He refreshed the app about a month ago and added requested features, the most demanded being toggles to filter out the noise coming from Wall Street Bets.
""It takes a lot of comments and a lot of upvotes to hit the top spots,"" said Schwelgin, whose scoring formula accounts for the number of comments, the age of the comments, and how many upvotes or downvotes the comments receive. 
Before the GameStop saga took off in mid-January, he had 100 visitors a day; now on some days he's seeing spikes of nearly 2,000 users. Dayminer has even caught the attention of some hedge-fund professionals eager to keep tabs on community's trading sentiment, industry sources told Insider.

Alternative data — a booming industry thanks to hedge funds desperate for an edge — has become the lifeblood of many managers, and changes to data streams and feeds can throw models and algorithms off. This month, the Vista-owned 7Park Data shut down its feeds to clients abruptly after it was folded into another Vista portfolio company. 
Steve Cohen's fund Point72 was sent scrambling last year, Insider reported, when the day-trading app Robinhood limited access to data on the most popular stocks on its platform. Data on the mood of Wall Street Bets users, many of whom trade on Robinhood, may be the next best thing.

GameStop stock: 3 experts on next move as Reddit traders take profits,https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-stock-experts-predict-next-move-reddit-traders-take-profits-2021-1,"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The easiest way to sum up all that's been said and written about the GameStop saga is perhaps by zeroing in on its stratospheric rally — a stunning gain of more than 600% in the past week despite a precipitous 60% plunge on Thursday morning. 
To put that into context, Tesla, another market favorite, shot up 740% in all of 2020. Bitcoin, which garners similar frenzy, doubled in value in less than a month before plummeting 20%.
The skyrocketing gains of the EV-maker and digital currency have made millionaires out of faithful retail holders and helped propel star stock-picker Cathie Wood's meteoric rise last year.
However, the story of the GameStop mania is on a whole other level. 
Even a Tesla-naire's rags-to-riches story pales in comparison to that of ""Roaring Kitty,"" a WallStreetBets poster and YouTuber who had allegedly turned about $54,000 into almost $48 million on his GameStop trade, according to his Reddit post on Wednesday. His fellow Reddit traders also boasted about their outsized gains on the forum as the stock kept surging since July last year. 
But what started out as a clash between the Wall Street establishment and retail investors has turned into a red-hot debate about market manipulation. As investing app Robinhood joined TD Ameritrade and E*Trade to restrict transactions in GameStop on Thursday, the stock plunged and customers sued. 
""People should have the opportunity to still participate, but we believe there's a certain responsibility for companies like ours to make sure that people have the chance to get educated,"" said Leif Abraham, co-chief executive of social investing app Public.com, in an interview on Wednesday. 
Public, which opted against trading restrictions before Thursday, chose to apply ""High Risk"" safety labels to GameStop and other highly volatile stocks instead.
Like much of 2020, the GameStop drama can seem unprecedented, but some investors say they have seen this before.
Hermann Peterscheck, a game developer-turned investor, said WallStreetBets traders remind him of the members of the old stock message boards on AOL, but only that the ""speed and reach of Reddit are orders of magnitude bigger and faster.""
""It's an incredible thing that is happening and I think it'll continue happening for a while. That said, I think it's bad lessons being learned that will end in tears,"" said Peterscheck, who founded Hypernormal Capital, a long-only hedge fund, last April. 
As much as Reddit investors are telling each other to ""hold the line and do not sell,"" they will eventually have to take profits on the GameStop trade. That's where the problem lies.
""Who are you going to sell it to, the other people on WallStreetBets? Because you just booted out all the hedge fund managers, you booted out all the long-term investors because they're playing a different game,"" he said, adding that investors should either take profits now or stay away.
""The mania can go the other way very quickly,"" he said. ""The pain that you get when it turns negative is much greater than the euphoria that you feel on the way up.""
He continued: ""There's going to be a few people that make a ton of money and they're celebrated. Then there's going to be a whole bunch of people who lose money that they may not be able to afford to lose, and they might get driven out of the market forever.""
While GameStop's rally is not driven by its fundamentals, the video game retailer, despite having lost $275 million over the past year, is not entirely hopeless. 
John Patrick Lee, ETF product manager of the $828.5 million VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO) said that the video game market is a structural long-term growth industry. While GameStop is not currently exposed to the high-growth trends such as mobile gaming and eSports, it can certainly pivot given its improved financial position.
Lee said GameStop could convert their brick-and-mortar stores into a live event space where gamers come to play video games in a competitive environment, or they could also raise money to purchase an eSports team and integrate themselves into the eSports ecosystem.
""There are a lot of different things that could do now,"" he said. "" I would expect to see over the next couple of weeks, some kind of announcement or a plan coming from GameStop as to where they are going to invest towards the future.""
To be sure, GameStop is currently not a holding in the VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF, which aims to cover the top 90% of the available free-float market cap of the video game industry. However, if the company meets the requirements set by the indexer at the next rebalancing date, it could come to the index, according to Lee. 
The parabolic rally of GameStop has reached other unloved stocks as Reddit traders search for their next targets. 
Their success so far has been manifested in the UBS high short interest basket (UBXXSHRT), which was up nearly 14% on Wednesday and 32% since last Thursday, said Stuart Kaiser, head of equity derivatives research at UBS, in a research note on Thursday.
These stock moves, whether they are driven by anger or boredom, could have a real impact on the structure of the market, according to Steven Chiavarone, co-manager of the $403.3 million Federated Hermes Global Allocation fund.
""Most problems start as an isolated activity in a corner of the market and some of those stay as isolated issues in a corner of the market and some of them become more generalized,"" he said.
Like many investors, Chiavarone is not sure how this GameStop episode will play out, but he knows what this means for him as a portfolio manager. 
""As a responsible portfolio manager, you've got to look in your portfolios and understand which names maybe have more short interest or might be susceptible to some of the volatility around here,"" he said. ""I think that's a good risk metric to look at.""

"GameStop hearing filled with heated exchanges, technical problems",https://www.businessinsider.com/congress-gamestop-stock-hearing-robinhood-reddit-citadel-what-happened-2021-2,"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Just weeks after the GameStop stock bubble popped, the US House of Representatives Financial Services Committee held an hours-long hearing examining what happened.
Though that hearing featured a variety of chief executives, from Reddit CEO Steve Huffman to Citadel CEO Ken Griffin, and even featured one popular financial influencer, the main target of questioning was Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev.
With over 50 members of the House of Representatives participating, the lines of questioning varied wildly. Some representatives asked Tenev about Robinhood's choice to halt trading of GameStop and other such ""meme stocks"" on January 28, while others asked him about Alex Kearns, a 20-year-old Robinhood user who thought he had lost $730,000 on the app. Kearns died by suicide in June 2020. 
""I'm sorry to the family of Mr. Kearns for your loss,"" Tenev said.
Kearns repeatedly contacted Robinhood's help desk, but didn't receive a response before he died. During his allotted time, Rep. Sean Casten played Tenev the recording that users hear when they call Robinhood for help.
He also criticized Robinhood for the ""innate tension"" at the heart of its business model, which he said is split ""between democratizing finance, which is a noble calling, and being a conduit to feed fish to sharks."" 
Lawmakers primarily focused on Tenev due to the stock trading app's critical role in the explosion of GameStop's stock value: Between January 20 and January 26, GameStop's stock value leaped from just over $35 per share to north of $140 per share. By January 27, it hit new highs of over $325 per share — an over 8,000% increase from just a few months ago.
The next morning, Robinhood halted trades of the stock because it ran out of money to cover the upfront cost of its customers stock purchases. The company even had to dilute its own value in order to quickly raise capital — a $3.4 billion investment from several different firms was announced in early February.
Tenev repeatedly told lawmakers the same story he's told previously: Robinhood was forced to temporarily halt trading of GameStop and several other stocks because the National Securities Clearing Corporation demanded $3 billion to cover volatile trades.
And he refuted claims that the decision was driven by the hedge funds which had taken out short positions on GameStop stock, as did Melvin Capital Management CEO Gabe Plotkin who also joined the hearing.
Another notable criticism repeatedly leveled at Robinhood: Gamification. The app notoriously features audio and visual elements that cheer on user actions. ""We didn't encourage anyone to tap on anything,"" Tenev said in one such exchange. ""We wanted to give our customers delightful features so they know we're listening to them and we care about them.""
From the very beginning of the hearing, technical issues plagued the video conference. Hot mics were frequent, and a few major sound issues caused pauses.
As the hearing — which kicked off at noon — pushed on, exchanges between legislators and interviewees got more and more brief.  
Legislators frequently cut in mid-answer with ""I'll reclaim my time"" in an effort to squeeze another question in. And an exchange between Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Citadel CEO Ken Griffin just after the five-hour mark got particularly contentious, as he attempted to talk over her. ""Let me finish my answer. I think it's important,"" he said. ""No, no,"" Tlaib responded. 
The few exchanges with Keith ""Roaring Kitty"" Gill, a stock trader who made a name for himself as a YouTuber, were largely focused on what he specializes in: stock advice. Gill said he would still buy GameStop stock at its current value, and that he initially bought in months ago because it was ""undervalued."" Also of note: Gill's opening statement included at least one notable meme reference.
Ultimately, there were no huge revelations about the GameStop stock bubble or the major players involved in it from Thursday's hearing. It's the first of several such hearings that the financial services committee plans in the wake of the bubble's popping.

"Netflix making movie about GameStop, Noah Centineo starring: Deadline",https://www.businessinsider.com/noah-centineo-gamestop-movie-netflix-film-wall-street-reddit-2021-2,"Tue, 02 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Streaming giant Netflix is in talks to make a movie about how Reddit users bumped up the price of GameStop stock and torched some massive hedge funds in the progress, Deadline reported Monday.
This could rival a similar film MGM is making.
The currently untitled Netflix film would star ""To All The Boys I've Loved Before"" actor Noah Centineo and be produced by Brad Weston and Nick Styne, sources close to the matter told Deadline.
""The Hurt Locker"" screenwriter Mark Boal is in negotiations to write it, and NYU Stern marketing professor Scott Galloway is in talks to consult on the script, the sources said.
The movie will investigate the power social media has given the masses to challenge the financial and political elite, the sources said. Alongside the GameStop saga, they said the movie would explore how social media was used to spread baseless claims about voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election, which ultimately culminated in supporters of former President Donald Trump storming the US Capitol in a violent insurrection on January 6.
Insider has reached out to Netflix for comment.

Netflix isn't the only company making rapid moves to bring the GameStop saga to the big screen. Rival film studio MGM has bought the rights to the book ""The Antisocial Network"" by Ben Mezrich, whose work includes the inspiration for the hit 2010 film about the founding of Facebook, ""The Social Network.""
MGM's film would be produced by Ryder Picture Company's Aaron Ryder, with both Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss as producers, sources close to the matter told Deadline. MGM acquired the rights Friday night after a heated bidding war, Deadline's sources said.
Day traders banded together on Reddit to bump up the prices of several stocks, most notably video-games retailer GameStop but also AMC, BlackBerry, and Nokia, after noticing that hedge funds were betting against them.
GameStop stock has gained massively in recent weeks — from below $5 late last year to a peak of more than $450 a share on Thursday. As a result, some of Wall Street's prominent hedge funds were forced to close their bearish bets against the company, with hefty losses.
Online brokerage Robinhood responded by restricting purchases in highly volatile stocks on Thursday, causing GameStop stock to drop. Robinhood's CEO, Vlad Tenev, is reportedly expected to testify as part of a House hearing on Wall Street's role in the chaos.
Disclosure: Mathias Döpfner, CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, is a Netflix board member.

"GameStop hearing: What to watch for from Gabe Plotkin, Ken Griffin",https://www.businessinsider.com/melvin-gabe-plotkin-citadel-ken-griffin-reddit-gamestop-congressional-hearing-2021-2,"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The men — and it's almost always men — who run hedge funds don't speak publicly, and they definitely don't like doing so in front of Congress. 
But compared to the last time Citadel founder Ken Griffin sat in front of a congressional panel, Thursday's hearing on last month's GameStop-addled market frenzy comes at a much more pleasant time.
In November of 2008, roughly two months after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt with the housing market in ruins, Griffin along with fellow hedge-fund billionaires Jim Simons, George Soros, John Paulson, and Philip Falcone answered questions for two hours on whether there needed to be more regulation on hedge funds. While Paulson famously made billions on the collapse of the housing market, Griffin did do not nearly as well — Citadel, then 17 years old, was slammed by Lehman's collapse, with funds down more than 30%.
Of course, Citadel survived and has since thrived, hitting its 30th anniversary with more assets than ever while Griffin's separate market-making business, Citadel Securities, continues to grow its market share.
This time around, it's a different hedge-fund golden boy who is down big as he steps up to mic in front of Congress: Melvin Capital founder Gabe Plotkin.
The two hedge funds are being called to testify as Congress examines the links between social media, short-selling, and retail traders. Along with Griffin and Plotkin, Reddit cofounder and CEO Steve Huffman, Robinhood cofounder Vlad Tenev, researcher Jennifer Schulp, and GameStop trader Keith Gill, also known as Roaring Kitty on Twitter and YouTube, will also testify. 
Plotkin's fund lost more than half of its assets in January thanks to a large short position against video-game retailer GameStop. The stock jumped to prices more than 20 times what it started the year at in late January as traders on popular Reddit forums like Wall Street Bets using apps like Robinhood pumped up the stock — and targeted Plotkin specifically. 
Griffin is in the spotlight for having roles on both sides of the saga. Citadel Securities was a key player in executing Robinhood users' trades that catapulted GameStops shares last month, while his hedge fund came Plotkin's rescue, infusing $2 billion into Melvin Capital as it got crushed.
Plotkin, who owns a minority stake in the NBA's Charlotte Hornets and bought $44 million of property in Miami at the end of last year, may do what few – if any — wealthy hedge fund managers have done before: Ask for pity. 
Melvin became a target of retail traders because it disclosed some of its bets against GameStop, in the form of put options, in a 13F filing months before the end of 2020. While well-known short-sellers like Andrew Left had publicly spoken about betting against the video-game retailer, Melvin's disclosure showed investors in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit how much he had to lose if the stock went soaring. 
It wasn't just GameStop either; the Robinhood traders targeted other stocks Melvin had put options on, including Bed, Bath & Beyond and AMC. 
The losses led to a bailout from Griffin and Plotkin's former boss Steve Cohen to the tune of $2.75 billion.
In an opening testimony released ahead of the hearing, Plotkin defends his short position in GameStop saying it reflected the retailer's fundamentals and that it never was part of an effort to ""artificially depress or manipulate downward the price of a stock,"" as some Redditors saw it. 
He also addressed how he was personally zeroed in on the message boards.  
""Many of these posts were laced with antisemitic slurs directed at me and others,"" Plotkin said. ""The posts said things like 'it's very clear we need a second holocaust, the jews can't keep getting away with this.' Others sent similarly profane and racist text messages to me.""
Retail traders' attack on Plotkin's hedge fund was highlighted by many people in the industry as something that needed to at least be checked out by regulators. Others think more drastic measures should be taken.
Leon Cooperman, in a CNBC interview at the end of January, said the day traders were using their stimulus checks from the government to trade stocks as ""a way of attacking wealthy people."" One long-time hedge fund manager told Insider if people were to collude to send a stock price down by 80%, participants would likely go to jail. Another said the targeted trading would have been considered ""extremely illegal"" if it had been done by a group hedge funds instead ""Reddit gangsters.""  
Nonprofit Better Markets put out a memo Wednesday outlining the areas Congress should consider asking about and possibly legislating on, including ""whether some class of retail investors demonstrably intended to engage in manipulative trading practices to effect a short squeeze.""
While Plotkin doesn't strike a sympathetic figure in the middle of a pandemic that has costs millions their job, he could be backed in pushing for some type of oversight on this type of retail trading as more stories trickle out of big losses sustained by retail investors. Better Markets' memo notes that ""real people lost billions of dollars in GameStop trading."" 
Robinhood already has come under fire from people as varied as Senator Ted Cruz to rapper Ja Rule for temporarily stopping certain tickers from being traded on its platform, and its cofounder Tenev will have to answer Thursday about its relationship with Griffin's Citadel Securities.
Citadel Securities pays Robinhood and other online brokerages for its order flow — which is how these brokerages can offer users commission-free trades. The connection – between Griffin's market-making firm and his hedge fund that backed hard-hit Melvin – sparked Reddit rumors about Griffin's influence on the entire market.
""Citadel Securities has not instructed or otherwise caused any brokerage firm to stop, suspend, or limit trading or otherwise refuse to do business,"" a spokesperson for the firm told Insider earlier this month. ""Citadel Securities remains focused on continuously providing liquidity to our clients across all market conditions.""
According to Griffin's prepared testimony, Citadel executed 7.4 billion shares on behalf of retail investors on Jan. 27 — more than the average daily volume of the entire US equity market in 2019.
The volatility in the markets and in the specific names give market makers like Citadel Securities wider spreads and more profits, though price discovery is more difficult when markets are as choppier as they were at the end of January. 
Payment for order flow (PFOF) is a common industry practice and lowers the cost of investing for millions of retail traders. But Better Markets said in its memo that it ""causes an inevitable conflict-of-interest between the retail broker-dealer's duties to seek best execution for its customers and its duties to shareholders and others to maximize revenues."" The nonprofit recommends Congress ""explore legislative solutions that would prohibit the practice.""
In his prepared testimony, Griffin argues that PFOF is the key reason retail investors are able to trade for free or low-cost today.
He suggests that any regulatory focus should be on shortening settlement cycles from two days to one instead. 
Robinhood and other brokerages said they limited trades on ""meme stocks"" after Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., or DTCC — the central clearing and settlement organization for US stocks — raised collateral requirements for brokers in response to the market volatility.
""As we have seen, longer settlement periods expose firms to more risk in the time between execution and settlement, requiring higher levels of capital,"" Griffin said.
Griffin, a big donor to Republicans who keep regulation to a minimum, may not be interested in any additional guidelines from federal agencies. In 2008, he lobbied for clearinghouses to be set-up for the derivatives market, but said: ""it is not my belief that we need greater government regulation of hedge funds with respect to the systemic risk they create.""
""Our financial markets work best when they are competitive, fair, and transparent,"" he said.

Reddit's WallStreetBets celebrated as GameStop stock soared,https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-wallstreetbets-celebrats-as-gamestop-stock-soars-2021-2,"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"WallStreetBets (WSB), the Reddit community that encourages anyone with an internet connection to trade like a stock broker, is still impacting the market.
Weeks of controversy and turbulence have plagued the subreddit, stemming from a bounce in GameStop stock to over $400 at the end of January. On Wednesday, a similar bump happened again to the stock, bringing it as high as $200 after hours. WSB hopefuls that had invested late or never got a chance the first time around were elated at this opportunity to jump on the bandwagon.
Interest in the GME stock was so high Wednesday, that Reddit itself seemed to struggle to deal with the traffic load. At around 4 p.m. EDT on Wednesday, the whole site went down for about an hour, potentially sparked by people flocking to the subreddit. 
The most popular and highly upvoted sentiment currently on WallStreetBets is the exact same one that's permeated the sub since GameStop first took off: hold your stocks and don't sell until it hits record highs or ""goes to the moon."" Through highly edited videos, sea shanties, and wrestling promos, users are implored to have ""diamond hands,"" or to not sell their stock.
""You held on, you stuck with it. And now, we're going back up baby,"" user AquaSea_Squirrel wrote in a post that was upvoted over 33,000 times. ""Obviously no road trip runs without bumps, sometimes you even get a flat tire. But you generally get where you're going."" 
 
Many on the subreddit were skeptical that the stock would ever rise again and made bets that they'd never thought they'd have to keep like getting tattoos, piercing their ears, or moving to Bulgaria. Reddit user nogoodnameswork cataloged nearly every single promise made on the board based on the GameStop stock, holding them accountable to their ridiculous comments or permanently banning them from WSB. 
As of Thursday morning, Gamestop stock has started to fall once again, losing about 25% of its value. User matt1028 posted a quickly rising thread claiming that stocks are getting shorted, or borrowed for a cheaper price in an attempt to get people to ""panic sell."" 
That hasn't stopped users from investing in the stock, with it still rising and falling sporadically. 
""Sold most of my shitty portfolio and put it all into GME wish me luck,"" wrote HideYoGurl, one of the thousands of other users posting in the daily discussion thread of the stock.  ""Once this suckin thing hits $10,000 I'm gonna move my family somewhere tropical and bring my Nana with me,"" wrote GrimandNordic1. 
After the initial wave of GameStop interest, the subreddit became the target of mainstream media attention. Outlets in traditional and online media scrambled to explain to the masses why a bunch of self-described ""degenerates"" were causing a stock to soar while asking for ""tendies.""
The subreddit itself boomed in popularity, gaining over seven million subscribers in under one month. This popularity and media attention put a lot of pressure on the moderators of the subreddit, whose job is to regulate the posts and delete spam. On February 3, a group of moderators that had been inactive on the sub came back, prompted by the prospect of a movie deal and fame, removing the site's current moderators. After a day of turmoil, the original moderators were reinstated and after a few more days most of the original team returned.
On February 18, a Congressional hearing with the House Financial Services Committee was held to discuss what went on with GameStop and the trading app Robinhood. Keith Gill, known as DeepF---Value on WallStreetBets, was one of the people brought in to testify. The user had invested heavily in Gamestop and became one of the figureheads of the WallStreetBets movement.

"Barstool's Dave Portnoy, GameStop Reddit traders are bag holders",https://www.businessinsider.com/dave-portnoy-gamestop-reddit-traders-taught-america-bag-holder-2021-2,"Tue, 02 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Pour one out for Barstool Sports' founder, Dave Portnoy. After cheering the meteoric rise of ""meme stocks"" like AMC and GameStop, he said Tuesday that he sold his positions in them at a $700,000 loss. In the process, he has taught America one of the most important phrases on Wall Street: bag holder.
A bag holder in this context is someone who is left owning a stock (or bond, or any security) as it is declining in value. It means the person will have to sell the security at a loss after many, many other much savvier people already sold their shares. It means the person will almost certainly lose a lot of money.
You see, Portnoy and his Wall Street Bets friends on Reddit are not the only ones who can meme.
What makes Portnoy the baggiest of bag holders is not just the money he lost but the stupid way he lost it and all the whiny noise he made on the way.
When GameStop's stock screamed up from $17 at the beginning of January to its high of almost $400 on the backs of the Reddit-fueled rally, Portnoy told anyone listening that he would never sell the stock. He told Fox News and CNN; he told his followers on Twitter and Instagram. He made fun of people who told him the fundamentals of financial analysis showed that the stocks he championed were extremely overpriced. He scoffed at the idea that he was part of a bubble.
And yet, according to Portnoy, he ""bought at the absolute high"" for GameStop, AMC, and Nokia — another meme stock — and ""sold at the exact bottom.""

He also demonstrated he had no idea what he was doing or how anything on Wall Street works. On Thursday, the brokerage app Robinhood paused users' ability to buy the meme stocks to recapitalize. It had allowed traders on its app to take on so much risk that it was forced to raise more money to meet regulatory requirements.
But Portnoy and his paranoid stock-junky friends on Reddit insisted that this was Robinhood's attempt to help the hedge fund managers they had already blown up in this trade, such as Melvin Capital, which lost 53% in January, largely because of its bet against GameStop.
Portnoy whined to an indignant Tucker Carlson on Fox News on Thursday night that he was being oppressed by the Wall Street machine. When Carlson informed him that Robinhood actually made money by selling order flow (its customers' trading data) to Citadel (a securities firm that shares a parent company with a hedge fund that gave Melvin a cash injection as it got slammed), he looked as if he would burst into tears.

Of course, Robinhood's relationship with Citadel Securities is not a secret. Everyone on Wall Street knows this is Robinhood's business model. It's how the app is able to provide no-fee trading to its users (you know what they say about ""free""). Everyone also knows that the more risk Robinhood takes on — the more wildly Portnoy and his friends trade — the more capital Robinhood will have to have on hand to meet regulatory requirements.
On Monday night, just before he capitulated, Portnoy again claimed he would never sell his meme stocks. But what was truly stunning about Portnoy's interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo was his inability to accept that he simply didn't understand the rules of the game he was playing.
He stood firm in the idea that any rational person who experienced the pause in trading he experienced would believe a conspiracy was afoot. In one breath he claimed he understood why Robinhood needed to pause trading, and in the next he was spitting out delusional conspiracy theories again. He claimed no one could have known about Robinhood's capital requirements (aside from, of course, everyone on Wall Street or anybody who cares to take even a little time to figure out what they're talking about).
It was a near-Trumpian inability to accept reality.
About 12 hours after his CNN interview — in a tweet announcing that he sold his meme stocks — Portnoy whined that the CEO of Robinhood should be in jail.
Any Wall Streeter will tell you: Insisting that losing money in the stock market is everyone's fault but your own is peak bag-holder behavior.
Portnoy, of course, will be fine. He is still a wealthy man, and he bet a very small portion of his fortune on meme stocks. Fans who listened to him, however, might well have taken on quite a bit more risk.
On Monday, Cuomo asked Portnoy whether he felt responsible for telling his followers to hold on to stocks that Wall Street's math minds said had little real value. Portnoy said ""no.""
He thinks of the stock market less like a math problem requiring people to learn concepts and apply analysis but more like casino in which you just need to keep playing when you're on a heater. He told Cuomo he did not feel responsible for turning his faithful Stoolies into bag holders; he insisted that as with any gamblers they knew the risks.
But surely some did not. It's very likely that most people following Portnoy into these meme trades shared his ignorance of how anything on Wall Street works.
In fact, part of the appeal of these ""meme trades"" is that they are information agnostic. They replace financial analysis and any kind of systemic reasoning with a violent shove from the bowels of the internet. It is unsurprising that some of these traders were (or will be) left flatfooted when the math shoves back. Bag holders are often surprised when all is said and done.
So perhaps — just as a form of apology — it would be a nice gesture if Barstool decreed that the next few Saturdays are for the broke boys.

"Roaring Kitty, Wall Street and Reddit CEOs to Testify at GameStop Hearing",https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-vlad-tenev-ceo-gamestop-waters-house-wall-street-hearing-2021-2,"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The CEOs of brokerage app Robinhood, social-media site Reddit, hedge fund Citadel, and investment-management firm Melvin Capital will testify as part of a House hearing into the GameStop saga, alongside YouTube streamer Roaring Kitty.
The witnesses will testify before the House Financial Services Committee (FSC) on Thursday.
FSC Chairwoman Maxine Waters announced the hearing ""Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide"" in January.
Robinhood's Vlad Tenev, Citadel's Kenneth Griffin, Melvin Capital's Gabriel Plotkin, and Reddit's Steve Huffman will all be present, alongside Keith Gill, known more widely by his YouTube name Roaring Kitty, Waters said Friday.
Additional witnesses may be named, she added.
Read more: Volatility expert Christopher Cole warns that Wall Street needs to wake up to social media 'weaponization'. Here are his top takeaways from the GameStop frenzy.
The hearing will focus on short selling, online trading platforms, and gamification, and the impact they have on capital markets and retail investors. Lawmakers including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had called on the FSC to hold a hearing, and investigate if necessary.
Day traders banded together on Reddit to bump up the prices of several stocks, most notably GameStop but also AMC, BlackBerry, and Nokia, after noticing that hedge funds were betting against them.
This caused GameStop stock to jump massively — from below $5 late last year to a peak of more than $450 a share on January 28. Gill's GameStop investments allegedly swelled to $48 million.
As a result, some of Wall Street's prominent hedge funds, including Melvin Capital, were forced to close their bearish bets against Gamestop, with hefty losses. In January, Point72 and Citadel said they would invest $2.75 billion in Melvin Capital.
Robinhood responded to the booming prices by restricting purchases in highly volatile stocks on January 28, causing GameStop stock to drop. The online brokerage has come under fire for its decision, with both politicians and Reddit users saying it disadvantaged individual investors.
The Robinhood app was bombarded with negative reviews on the Google Play store and was criticized by Ocasio-Cortez, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, and Tesla's CEO Elon Musk.

Tenev told Musk that Robinhood had been forced to temporarily stop users from buying those stocks because the surge had resulted in a deposit requirement of $3 billion from the National Securities Clearing Corporation. This echoed an email Robinhood sent to members, which said: ""We didn't want to stop people from buying stocks and we certainly weren't trying to help hedge funds.""
""We must deal with the hedge funds whose unethical conduct directly led to the recent market volatility and we must examine the market in general and how it has been manipulated by hedge funds and their financial partners to benefit themselves while others pay the price,"" Waters said when announcing the hearing.
""Hedge funds have a long history of predatory conduct and that conduct is entirely indefensible,"" she added, calling out private funds who engage in ""vulture strategies that hurt workers.""
Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the incoming chairman of the Senate Banking and Housing Committee, has also said he will hold a hearing into the GameStop saga.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also come under scrutiny during the GameStop trading frenzy. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a longtime critic of Wall Street, told CNN the saga showed the SEC needs to ""grow a backbone"" and regulate hedge funds.
Netflix and MGM are both reportedly making movies about the saga.
Correction: A previous version of this story misstated Citadel's relationship to the GME frenzy. The company invested $2 billion in Melvin.

GameStop CFO to exit with about $30 million: Bloomberg,https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-cfo-jim-bell-about-30-million-exit-package-bloomberg-2021-2,"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"GameStop's CFO, Jim Bell, may take home about $30 million as he leaves the retailer, Bloomberg reported. 
Bell's contract included severance of $2.8 million, along with a departure award of restricted shares worth about $13 million, according to Bloomberg. Much of the rest of the package would be in equity grants tied to company performance over the next few years, the report said. 
The company on Tuesday announced Bell's departure, saying in a press release he would resign on March 26. Diana Jajeh, senior vice president and chief accounting officer, will serve as interim chief financial officer while the company searches for a permanent replacement.
The company said it's seeking a chief financial officer with ""the capabilities and qualifications to help accelerate GameStop's transformation.""
Bell was appointed to the chief financial position at GameStop in July 2019, less than two years ago. He had previously been CFO and interim CEO at Wok Holdings, parent company of P.F. Chang's, according to his company profile. 
In 2020, activist investor Ryan Cohen bought a stake in GameStop, and took a seat on the company's board. Cohen, a co-founder of internet retailer Chewy, also installed two of his former Chewy lieutenants on the GameStop board. 
In November 2020, Cohen wrote a letter to the company's executive team, pushing for the company to become a ""technology-driven business."" Cohen wrote: ""But this pivot requires the type of strategic vision that has not yet taken hold in the c-suite or boardroom.""
Bell's equity package has benefited from the recent spikes in GameStop stock, which was pushed higher in an epic struggle between retail investors and short sellers. When Bell joined GameStop, the company's stock price hovered around $5.30 per share. In January, it spiked briefly to $483 per share, although it settled back into the range of $40 to $50 per share. 
Depending on the company's future performance, Bell could receive about 300,000 shares in the coming years, depending on how the company does, Bloomberg reported. Those shares were worth about $13.4 million based on Monday's $44.97 closing price of GameStop shares.

Elon Musk questions Robinhood CEO over GameStop stock drama,https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-clubhouse-robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-interview-gamestop-stocks-2021-2,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The GameStop stock saga took a new turn on Sunday night when Tesla CEO Elon Musk unexpectedly interviewed Vlad Tenev, the CEO of the trading app Robinhood, on the new audio app Clubhouse.
Robinhood was the target of widespread outrage last week when it stopped users from purchasing shares of GameStop, AMC, BlackBerry, and other so-called meme stocks that had rocketed over the week, fueled by Reddit users.
Musk went on Clubhouse for a wide-ranging interview in which he spoke about his plans to colonize Mars; his neural-technology company, Neuralink; and his love of memes. At the end of the interview, Musk brought in Tenev, introducing him as ""Vlad the stock impaler.""
Read more: The unofficial story of how Clubhouse founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth failed their way to a $1 billion app
""Spill the beans, man, what happened last week? Why couldn't people buy the GameStop shares?"" Musk said. ""The people demand an answer, and they want to know the details and the truth.""
Tenev said Robinhood had been forced to temporarily stop users from buying those stocks because the surge had resulted in a deposit requirement of $3 billion from the National Securities Clearing Corporation. Robinhood, which had raised only $2 billion in venture capital, spoke with the NSCC to get that requirement reduced to $700 million, Tenev said.
His comment echoed a statement from Robinhood on Friday.
Tenev said that the NSCC's decision-making process to get to the $3 billion figure was ""opaque"" and that it was hard to know why it settled on that.
""Did something maybe shady go down here?"" Musk said.
Tenev answered that he wouldn't say so, adding that the NSCC had been cooperative after the initial $3 billion deposit request.
Musk also asked whether Citadel Securities, a market maker and intermediary for Robinhood, could have influenced the NSCC's decision.
""There was a rumor that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into doing this,"" Tenev said, ""and that's just false.""
""But wouldn't they have a strong say in who got put in charge of that organization since it's an industry consortium and not a government consortium, or not a government regulatory agency?"" Musk said of the NSCC.
Tenev said he didn't ""have any reason to believe"" that. ""Then you're getting into the conspiracy theories a little bit,"" he said.
A Citadel Securities spokesperson told Insider: ""Citadel Securities has not instructed or otherwise caused any brokerage firm to stop, suspend, or limit trading or otherwise refuse to do business. Citadel Securities remains focused on continuously providing liquidity to our clients across all market conditions.""
Musk regularly chimed in during the interview with jokes; at one point he asked Tenev, ""Is anyone holding you hostage right now?""
Many of the Reddit traders said a motivation for galvanizing meme stocks was to take on hedge funds with heavily shorted stocks. Musk, who has historically attacked short-sellers, has been described as a sort of folk hero for Reddit day traders.
This wasn't the first time Musk demanded answers from Robinhood. Last week, he expressed support for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's call for the House Financial Services Committee to hold a hearing on the app's actions.
Robinhood allowed trading of meme stocks to resume on Monday with some restrictions.

Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev says GameStop trade restictions,https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-ceo-vladimir-tenev-says-gamestop-trade-restictions-2021-2,"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev said his company could have done more to communicate why some stocks, including GameStop, were switched temporarily to sell-only trading. 
""No doubt we could have communicated this a little bit better to customers,"" Tenev said on the All-In Podcast, as Reuters first reported.
Robinhood on January 28 had restricted buying on 13 stocks, including GameStop and AMC, as members of Reddit's Wall Street Bets group fueled a buying frenzy.
In a blog posted at the time, the company said it blocked purchases for some stocks to order to meet deposit requirements from clearinghouses registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
A Robinhood user launched a class-action suit, and lawmakers called for the SEC to look into market volatility. 
The House Financial Services Committee scheduled a virtual hearing for February 18. Tenev is expected to testify, along with executives from Reddit, Citadel, and Melvin Capital.
 
In the podcast published late Friday, Tenev said Robinhood had an internal dashboard, which allowed the company to manually switch stocks to sell-only when necessary. 
""That process is actually operationalized within Robinhood,"" he said. ""So it's — we do it from time to time, under various circumstances, like corporate actions.""
Trades would be restricted during a reverse stock split, as an example, he added. 
""So, there's a button in a dashboard that you can click and automated emails get sent out. It's an operational process that, I think, in hindsight, we should have exceptionalized to make it clearer why we were doing this,"" he said during the podcast. 
When GameStop and the other 12 stocks were limited, the reaction from users who received automated emails was swift, said Tenev. 
""As soon as those emails went out, the conspiracy theories immediately started coming. So, my phone was blowing up with, 'How could you do this? How could you be on the side of the hedge funds?'"" he said. 
He added: ""Of course, we're not on the side of the hedge funds. We're building products for our customers. And we just had to do what we did to meet our deposit requirements.""

Reddit banned a group of WallStreetBets moderators after they staged an attempted coup,https://www.businessinsider.com/wallstreetbets-reddit-bans-moderators-gamestop-started-movie-deal-coup-2021-2,"Fri, 05 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"WallStreetsBets, a forum on Reddit that recently made headlines for boosting unlikely stock picks like Gamestop, has exploded in popularity over the past two weeks. This week, it experienced a virtual coup among moderators of the subreddit that resulted in multiple waves of bans from WallStreetBets and Reddit itself. 
On Thursday morning, a moderator who goes by zjz, claimed that the group of moderators who oversee WallStreetBets had split over a potential movie deal following the subreddit's viral fame, creating a power struggle between two groups. Moderators oversee control of individual subreddits like WallStreetBets and make sure the sub is following Reddit's rules by removing spam and posts that break the community guidelines. 
Writing in a post titled ""/r/wallstreetbets will die soon unless the admins save us,"" the longtime moderator asked for help after he said he was being ""taken hostage by the top moderators.""  According to zjz, moderators who hadn't been active on the WallStreetBets recently came back and took over, creating press email addresses and ""scrambling to get paid from some movie deal."" The post was quickly removed from the sub, alongside many comments criticizing the new moderators.
Read Also: The history of WallStreetBets, the Reddit group that upended the stock market 
According to a report from the New York Times, moderators of WallStreetBets had been discussing ""landing a movie deal"" and figuring out what their ""cut"" is in a conversation on Discord, a chat app. These mods had booted out anyone in their inner circle, like zjz, who questioned the deal and wanted the sub to remain fairly true to its original message of buying stocks with a ""YOLO"" mentality. The ousted moderators were not only against the movie deal, they also believed that the sudden influx of new users could lead to a sudden shift in subreddit culture, changing what made WSB initially unique.
""This was our clubhouse with all our friends where we let loose and were honest about being in it for the money, but not being in it to sell each other anything,"" zjz told the New York Times over email.
R/WallStreetBetsTest, a sub created nine months ago by zjz, has become the new hub for these ousted mods and the place to discuss the drama that transpired. 
Shortly after zjz's removal, fellow mod jamsi announced that they had been removed as well. Claiming to have over 14 years of experience as a moderator on the platform, they offered their assistance to help deal with the volume of traffic and posts only a week ago. In that seven-day period, they claim to have moderated ""an average of 1,500 posts and comments per day."" 
 
""I was confused, annoyed and sad trying to understand what had happened,"" jamsi wrote. 
Over the next day, other WallStreetBet moderators like notmikjaash and bawse1 left their duties or were kicked out by the current administration. A petition was posted, asking Reddit administrators to step in and reinstate the old team that has pulled in nearly 9,000 upvotes. 
On Thursday evening, the WallStreetBets moderators who attempted the coup were removed by Reddit for breaking the platform's guidelines. At Reddit, a hands-off approach is usually saved for moderators, with the company rarely stepping in and forcefully clearing away those in charge of their subreddits. During all of this, WallStreetBetsTest went private, going public again early on Friday morning. 
Reddit's ""Moderator Guidelines for Healthy Communities""  require a ""stable and active team of moderators"" and ""association to a brand"" and it's unclear if the new wave of mods were able to adhere to these rules.
In total, six moderators had turned over by Friday, including turdled who had personally banned jamsi. Seven of WallStreetBet's older moderators were reinstated so that the sub could go back to some level of normalcy. 
""Matters are now returning to normalcy and the original mods are taking back control,"" jamsi wrote in a post on WallStreetBetsTest. ""This is a good first step in healing for this community that we care so much about.""
Mod upheaval on WallStreetBets has happened before. In April of 2020, founder of the sub Jaime Rogozinski was forcefully removed as a moderator from the sub after he pushed a ""Wall Street Bet Championship"" event where he may have had a stake in its sponsorship and success.  Rogozinski recently sold the rights to his life story to entertainment company RatPac Entertainment according to the Wall Street Journal.

GameStop stock is 'extremely volatile' but can't be controlled: filing,https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-stock-extremely-volatile-executives-say-cant-be-controlled-2021-3,"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"GameStop said Tuesday that its stock is —and continues to be — ""extremely volatile."" 
Moreover, that volatility is ""due to numerous circumstances beyond our control.""
The statement in a regulatory filing is the first such statement from GameStop leadership on its ongoing stock price fiasco that's seen its shares rise as much as 1600% in a matter of weeks. 
Under the ""risk factors"" section of the annual report, the company's stock volatility is listed as the primary risk factor related to the company's stock. It specifically cites ""short squeezes"" as a primary reason for that volatility.
""The market price of our Class A Common Stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile due to numerous circumstances beyond our control,"" GameStop said in the filing. 
GameStop's stock value has been explosively unpredictable since mid-January. 
Between January 15 and January 27, the price leapt from around $35 to just shy of $350. It's seen similarly huge dropoffs, but months later it's still in the $180 range.
The reason, of course, is the much discussed ""short squeeze"" from a large group of individual investors driving up the company's stock price in an effort to defeat short sellers betting against the stock. It's been a major topic of discussion for the past several months for loads of people in media and on Wall Street — except for GameStop leadership.
The company has more or less stayed mum for weeks, and even declined to discuss it on its quarterly earnings call this past week. Instead company leadership focused on the company's ongoing ""transformation"" led by Chewy cofounder and former CEO Ryan Cohen.
Since Cohen joined the company's board in January, taking charge of a ""strategic"" committee soon after, the company made a string of high-profile hires from the likes of Amazon and Chewy.
It is unclear what Cohen's specific plans are the future of the company, but he broadly outlined plans in an open letter to the company's board in late 2020. 
GameStop, ""needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences,"" Cohen wrote in the letter, ""not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""

Ryan Cohen profile: Chewy founder wants to revive GameStop,https://www.businessinsider.com/chewy-cofounder-ryan-cohen-plan-to-revive-gamestop-2021-2,"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Ryan Cohen is invested in three things that we know of: Apple, Wells Fargo, and GameStop. 
The entrepreneur and investor can attribute much of his wealth to the success of Chewy, which he cofounded and sold for $3.35 billion. 
He sat in tears outside the NYSE the night before the company went public in June 2019.
""It was emotional,"" he told the Wall Street Journal.
It was an awkward place for an entrepreneur. He had founded the company in 2011, grew it, and sold it to PetSmart in 2017. He left the company a year later, not long before the company made its IPO, with the private-equity-backed PetSmart holding onto the controlling stake. 
Priced at $22 per share, the IPO raised $1 billion at a valuation of $8.8 billion. The stock then surged as much as 88%, to $41.34, in its first day of trading before ending the day 59% higher. It was one most successful IPOs ever for a private equity-backed company.

And yet, the tears. Cohen, the visionary founder, wasn't a part of the IPO. 
""It feels like my baby is graduating from the college that I never went to,"" he told TechCrunch in 2019. 
In that same interview, Cohen's restlessness was already palpable. 
""I'm lucky. I'm talking to a lot of different entrepreneurs and business[es] and looking at corporate board opportunities,"" he said. ""I'm going through that exploratory process. I have no plans to sit in retirement, that's for sure. I'm 33 and I'm competitive and I like consumer businesses and I like to win.""
He put most of the proceeds from the sales of Chewy into Wells Fargo and Apple stock, which have respectively sagged (down 17%) and exploded (up 239%) in value since Cohen sold Chewy. Cohen told MarketWatch this past summer that his Apple stock was worth about $550 million. Apple's stock price has increased a further 39% since then.
Then, Cohen made a surprise move, spending just shy of $80 million on GameStop stock. 
The Reddit Stock Rebellion that led to GameStop's recent meteoric rally — and subsequent drop off a cliff — might not have happened at all had Cohen not stepped in to help the ailing retailer. 
""This man is going to take us to the moon,"" a member of the subreddit said of Cohen weeks before the company's stock ballooned.
In his mid-30s, his demographics read not unlike the retail investors who drove the company's stock price wild, but it's not entirely clear what about GameStop piqued Cohen's interest. GameStop is not a scrappy startup that he could see through to a wildly successful IPO, and it's not part of an industry that's heading towards a revival — most gamers have begun the transition from physical games to digital storefronts already. 
Critically, digital storefronts take time, infrastructure, and money to build — none of which GameStop has. Microsoft's Xbox store and Sony's PlayStation store are over 10 years old. Steam, the dominant digital storefront on PC, is nearly 20 years old. In all three cases, it took years of iteration and customer acquisition to compete with the physical retail market. 
Though Cohen's goal is to get GameStop involved in digital sales, he's already years late to the party.
Cohen has credited his father Ted, a glassware importer who died suddenly in December 2019, for everything he knows about business. 
""My father led by example, but not in a deliberate way. It's who he was,"" Cohen wrote in a tribute to his father. ""He admired the blue-collar worker. I watched him roll up his sleeves and help his employees move shipments of glassware from trucks into the warehouse, then put his suit jacket back on, shirt drenched in sweat, and do administrative work. I've never seen anyone work harder.""
Cohen, who grew up in Montreal and is now reportedly based in South Florida, became an entrepreneur at an early age. He started building websites at age 13; his first client was his father.
Teenage Cohen went door-to-door to local companies, offering to build them websites, he told CNBC Make It last year. 
He had other side hustles in high school. Writer Hillary Brenhouse tweeted earlier this week that she worked for Cohen when they were classmates. ""Dude was reselling imported sneakers when we were 14 and used to pay me to package stuff in his basement,"" she posted.
When Cohen was 15, he found real money in affiliate marketing — earning commissions for referring site visitors to e-commerce websites — and began making thousands of dollars a month.
After he dropped out of college, Cohen met Michael Day, his future Chewy cofounder, in an online chat room while looking for a programmer to help with his affiliate sites. Day dropped out of college to start a business with Cohen. By 2011, they were weeks away from launching an online jewelry business and had already bought $150,000 worth of inventory.
But while Cohen was shopping in a local pet store with his toy poodle, Tylee, another startup idea struck him. 
""I thought if I could deliver the same kind of personalized experience as the neighborhood pet store, but do it online and deliver a really convenient value proposition, that we could build a really big business,"" Cohen told Insider in 2019.
Cohen started Chewy — originally named Mr. Chewy — with Day, with the two respectively serving as CEO and CTO. 
When he set out to raise capital for their pet e-commerce business, more than 100 investors balked. Pet food sales were mostly offline, but Amazon was already taking over the online retail sector. 
Cohen tried to sell investors on Mr. Chewy's around-the-clock customer service, which understood how much customers cared about their pets.
""Call us 24/7 and someone picks up the phone within a few seconds, and we know every product that we sell really well,"" he said. ""That was really important to me because my pet was a family member, and I had a lot of questions. Pets can't speak, so you need to speak to someone who is an expert.""
It was still a tough sell. Chewy didn't complete a Series A until 2013 which was led by Larry Cheng of Volition, an investor who had originally turned them down.
Cohen told TechCrunch in 2019 that he ""knew nothing about raising capital."" He had ""no network"", no ""rich uncle"", and rounds of cold-calling VCs led to rejections ""basically every single time"" until Volition decided to invest. 
Chewy's personal treatment of customers extended to sending handwritten notes to customers after their first purchase or after a pet passes away. The Wall Street Journal reported that same year that Cohen would even surprise customers selected at random with oil paintings of their pets.
Amazon ""is the poster child for automation, it's a faceless machine,"" Cohen said. ""And I think that there is still a place in retail for providing a personalized experience.""
Acquiring customers was expensive but paid off. Sales doubled from $205 million in 2014 to $423 million in 2015, per The Harvard Business Review. 
PetSmart bought Chewy for $3.35 billion in 2017, then the largest e-commerce transaction of all time, and Cohen stepped down as CEO a year later. The deal was a calculated risk for both sides: PetSmart was a debt-laden company that had just been acquired in a leveraged buyout by BC Partners in 2015, and Chewy had been biting into its sales with its customer-centric service. Being in growth mode kept the company from profitability. 
Even after he departed Chewy, Cohen was still defending his creation. 
""We've seen this playbook pay off for companies like Amazon and Netflix, but their success doesn't make it any less nerve racking,"" he wrote in a CNBC op-ed. ""Without conviction in the underlying economics of the business, I would have found it very hard to sleep at night if I thought our strategy wasn't in the best interest of those employees, our millions of customers, or Chewy's shareholders.""
In 2020, Cohen penned an open letter to GameStop's board laying out his intentions.
""GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences,"" Cohen wrote, ""not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""
With over 5,000 stores worldwide, GameStop's retail footprint is enormous. That footprint has been a liability in recent years, as the majority of game buyers switched from physical to digital storefronts.
Between January 2019 and January 2020, GameStop's stock value dropped by two-thirds — from about $15 in January 2019 to under $5 by January 2020 — and it reshuffled its C-suite.
Once the coronavirus pandemic forced millions of people indoors, the sudden abundance of free time caused many to turn to video games. Sales of video-game hardware, software, accessories, and game cards topped $1.6 billion in March 2020, according to the market researcher The NPD Group's monthly report — ""the highest reported spend for a March month since the $1.8 billion achieved in March 2008.""
By the end of 2020, video game industry revenues topped both sports and film combined, NPD found. 
Still, the company's stock value remained in the gutter for much of 2020 before regaining its footing — surpassing its previous January 2019 high and hovering around $20 — later in the year following the release of new game consoles from Microsoft and Sony ahead of the holidays. 
By early January 2021, GameStop stock doubled after the company announced that Cohen would join its board alongside two of his former lieutenants at Chewy: former CFO Jim Grube and former CMO Alan Attal, who grew up with Cohen in Montreal.
Together, pending a vote in June, the three former Chewy execs will make up a third of the newly formed GameStop board of directors. 
Cohen, normally not shy with press, declined to comment on the stock volatility and hasn't given any interviews regarding his plans for GameStop, but he is making loud moves. In addition to bringing two former C-suite execs from Chewy to the board, he was behind the February resignation of GameStop CFO Jim Bell, according to sources close to the company. Cohen will chair a new board committee to focus on ""transformation.""
GameStop has made a recent slew of notable hires including Amazon logistics leaders and the former VP of customer service at Chewy. Technology veteran Jenna Owens took over as Chief Operating Officer just this month. The push is going to continue as GameStop announced in its fourth-quarter earnings press release that it is ""continuing to actively pursue senior talent with E-Commerce, retail and technology experience.""
Despite being the world's largest video game retailer GameStop's story in recent years is similar to PetSmart's before it made the bold move to buy Chewy.
Like music and movie retailers in the '90s, from Suncoast to Tower Records, video game retail stores face major challenges to their business model from the internet. As more people buy video games through digital storefronts like Steam or the Xbox Store, fewer buy games on physical discs from GameStop.
Cohen sees a way out — and it's just like the one he pulled off years ago, before he missed out on Chewy's big IPO. 
In his letter to GameStop's board in November 2020, Cohen laid out a vision for what he believes GameStop can become: ""a powerful e-commerce platform that provides competitive pricing, broad gaming selection, fast shipping and a truly high-touch experience that excites and delights customers,"" he wrote. Naturally, Cohen likened the idea for the e-commerce future of GameStop to ""the type of world-class infrastructure that was constructed at Chewy."" 
""He clearly has experience as someone who can build a successful online speciality retailer, which is precisely the type of mindset that GameStop needs if it's going to continue to play a role in the growing games market,"" game industry analyst and New York University professor Joost van Dreunen told Insider. ""Ironically, it may prove to be easier for GameStop to ward off Amazon in an online environment than in a physical arena.""
That's because, even for Amazon, margins on video games are ""razor thin,"" Van Dreunen said. ""Consequently, GameStop still pushes 7x more hardware units for console manufacturers than Amazon.""
Cohen regularly ties Chewy's success to its obsession with customer satisfaction — so-called ""high-touch service"" — in a category of customers that treat their pets like their first-born children. With GameStop, Cohen is once again facing a passionate consumer base with nostalgia for the games of their youth, while trying to take on Amazon.
According to Reuters, Cohen has been targeting GameStop's customer service since joining the board in January, asking for upgrades to the company's website and emailing with customers. In one case, he got a refund for a dissatisfied shopper who had not even asked for one.
While he's keeping quiet, he must be happy being back in business, regardless of what GameStop shares are doing. 
As he famously said: ""retirement sucks.""

"GameStop names Jenna Owens COO, is second Amazon alum to join c-suite",https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-coo-amazon-fulfillment-jenna-owens-2021-3,"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"GameStop announced on Tuesday that it has hired a tech industry veteran to join its executive team.
Jenna Owens will be the company's new COO after spending four years at Amazon, according to her LinkedIn profile, and most recently serving as the director for Amazon's fulfillment operations. She also spent four years at Google and five months at the online clothing service Rent the Runway.
Read more: Ryan Cohen made millions when Chewy got acquired. Now the millennial entrepreneur has a plan to turn around GameStop.
The news comes the day GameStop reported its fourth-quarter earnings, the first since the company's stunning stock frenzy in January, and reported a $215 million loss for fiscal 2020. GameStop's stock has had a tumultuous few months after an online forum drove the company's stock price to sky-high levels, but Wedbush said the stock's value is, ""completely disconnected from the fundamentals of the business.""
GameStop's appointment of Owens to the c-suite role marks yet another recruitment from Amazon's talent pool. In February, GameStop named Matt Francis as CTO after he spent time as an engineering leader at Amazon Web Services, Amazon's cloud arm.

GameStop also announced on Tuesday that it hired Neda Pacifico as its new senior vice president of e-commerce. Pacifico spent over four years at Amazon, per the press release, but most recently comes from the pet supply delivery company Chewy, where she served as vice president of e-commerce.
Pacifico isn't the only Chewy alum involved in GameStop: Ryan Cohen cofounded the company and served as its CEO until 2018. Cohen is now the largest individual shareholder in GameStop, has joined the company's board of directors, and is determined to steer the company into a new era of digital gaming, one in which it could rival Amazon. Two other former Chewy execs — Alan Attal and Jim Grube — also sit on GameStop's board. 
Before the pandemic, GameStop had become a dying relic of the video game world as players turned to digital games instead of physical copies. But the COVID-19 pandemic gave the company a slight boost as people, cut off from traditional means of entertainment, sought ways to keep busy at home.

How Ryan Cohen is transforming GameStop into the Amazon of video games,https://www.businessinsider.com/gamestop-ryan-cohen-amazon-chewy-revitalization-e-commerce-2021-3,"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The co-founder and CEO who convinced Wall Street that pets are big business has a new pet project: Turning GameStop into the Amazon of gaming.
After taking a 12.9% stake last year through his investment firm RC Ventures, Cohen has made major changes at GameStop. First, he oversaw a string of c-suite departures and hirings. Then, he was appointed leader of a new committee overseeing a company-wide ""transformation."" Now, he's taking over the company's board.
A whopping eight board members are stepping down, GameStop said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. That leaves only Cohen, his former Chewy colleagues Jim Grube and Alan Attal, kindred spirit/activist investor Kurt Wolf, and current CEO George Sherman as board members.
From a board that currently has 13 members, the new GameStop board of directors will have just five. And at least four of those five members are working together: Cohen, Grube, Attal, and Wolf. 
Notably, former Nintendo of America president and well-known video game personality Reggie Fils-Aimé is among the board members stepping down in June. He lasted just over a year in the position.
As for the executive team, CEO George Sherman is the only remaining member from before Cohen got involved with the company. Jim Bell, the company's CFO, is said to have been pushed to resign by the company's board. Soon after, CCO Frank Hamlin resigned. 
Cohen openly criticized Sherman, his c-suite, and GameStop's directors in a letter to the board about the company's overall direction in late 2020.
Sherman, ""appears committed to a twentieth-century focus on physical stores and walk-in sales, despite the transition to an always-on digital world,"" Cohen said. He added that the board lacks ""the type of strategic vision"" necessary for GameStop, ""to pivot toward becoming a technology-driven business that excels in the gaming and digital experience worlds.""
In his letter, Cohen said the company, ""needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences — not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem.""
Since Cohen joined the company's board in January, taking charge of a ""strategic"" committee soon after, the company has made a string of high-profile hires from the likes of Amazon and — you guessed it — Chewy.
Cohen himself has kept quiet across the last several months.
He has repeatedly declined interview requests, and his Twitter timeline is primarily GIFs and images. His most recent tweet is a GIF from the movie ""Ted,"" of the titular character smoking a bong. On the most recent GameStop earnings call, Cohen did not appear.
Representatives for Cohen and GameStop did not respond to requests for comment as of publishing.

Reddit's Wall Street Bets founder signed with a Hollywood talent agency that reps Jessica Alba and Kevin Hart,https://www.businessinsider.com/reddit-wall-streets-bet-founder-signs-kevin-hart-hollywood-agency-2021-3,"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Reddit's Wall Street Bets founder Jaime Rogozinski signed with a Hollywood talent agency as the entertainment industry looks to capitalize on the GameStop saga. 
United Talent Agency, which represents big names such as Jessica Alba, Seth Rogen, and Kevin Hart, is adding the Reddit star to its catalog after investors on his thread, r/wallstreetbets, forced a historic rally in GameStop shares that hurt short sellers. GameStop stock has since fluctuated in price, but its gains remain near 1000% year-to-date, Markets Insider data shows. 
""UTA has signed entrepreneur and tech visionary, Jaime Rogozinski for worldwide representation in all areas,"" a spokesperson said in an email to Insider.
With UTA, Rogozinski may appear in podcasts and speak at a conference in the fall, according to Bloomberg, which was first to report the story.

Hollywood has been picking up on the GameStop frenzy. MGM, for example, bought the film rights to a proposed book that will cover the saga. And last month, Deadline reported that Netflix is in talks to make a movie about what happened. That's just two of the nine projects already in the works about GameStop, Bloomberg reported. 
Rogozinski founded the Reddit group, r/wallstreetbets, in 2012, while he was working as an IT consultant. But the group only recently became popularized, as its members have helped pave the way for a frenzy in meme stocks, such as GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Blackberry, and Bed Bath & Beyond. In an interview, Rogozinski said seeing the GameStop rally was like watching a trainwreck in real-time.

GameStop rallies above $200 for the first time in a month as transition steps attract new bulls,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-stock-price-ryan-cohen-ecommerce-transformation-reddit-traders-gme-2021-3-1030164493,"Tue, 09 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Markets Insider,"GameStop climbed for a fifth straight day on Tuesday, signaling investors bullish toward the company's overhaul are sticking to their guns instead of playing the stock for quick profits.
Shares rose as much as 25% and landed above $200 for the first time since February 1. While the level remains well below the $483 peak seen during January's trading frenzy, shares are still up more than 900% year-to-date and about five times higher than where they stood mid-February.
The upswing follows larger gains made Monday after the company announced board member and Chewy founder Ryan Cohen will head a planning committee meant to usher in GameStop's transformation. Cohen said in a November letter that the video-game retailer needs to focus on e-commerce business and lean less on physical locations if it's to survive.
Steps taken since suggest GameStop heeded Cohen's warning. The company hired Amazon veteran Matt Francis to serve as its new chief technology officer in February. The transition committee is now tasked with hiring leaders for its e-commerce fulfillment and customer care arms, as well as find a new chief financial officer.
The group will also seek opportunities for transforming GameStop into a ""technology business"" and creating value for shareholders, the retailer said in a press release.
The announcement marks a new phase to the mania around GameStop stock. Shares famously shot higher in January as casual investors uniting online flooded the market with buy orders.
That phenomenon has mostly died out, but participating Reddit traders have replaced their calls of ""GME to the moon!"" with research into how GameStop can thrive as an e-commerce firm. The crude commentary, memes, and bragging about claimed windfalls remain.
Even Keith Gill, arguably the group's most famous GameStop bull, has cheered on the latest rally. The investor, known online as RoaringKitty and DeepF***ingValue, posted an update to his position on Monday. The one-day rally allegedly fueled an $8.5 million profit, bringing his total gain to $25.8 million.
Gill gained notoriety online for his early bullishness toward GameStop. Fame gained during the January surge led to his testifying to the House Financial Services Committee on the matter last month.
GameStop closed at $194.50 on Monday. The company has two ""buy"" ratings, two ""hold"" ratings, and three ""sell"" ratings from analysts.

Subreddit Founder Says Wall Street Bets Is 'Tired' of GameStop Talk,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/subreddit-founder-wall-street-bets-tired-gamestop-silver-short-squeeze-2021-3-1030229603,"Sat, 20 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Markets Insider,"Ivan Bayoukhi, the founder of subreddit Wall Street Silver, told Kitco News this week Wall Street Bets users are tired of talking about GameStop, and they did in fact trigger the silver short-squeeze in January, even though they said at the time this was not the case.
But the notorious subreddit had claimed they were not the ones behind silver's rally as they were more focused on members buying into GameStop, AMC, and other heavily shorted stocks.
""The Silver Squeeze is a hedge-fund coordinated attack so they can keep fighting the $GME fight,"" one user wrote last month. 
Bayoukhi, who was among users calling for betting on silver, said one can just scroll back five to six months on the WSB forum to find several silver-related posts. Some posts would even mention the Hunt Brothers who managed to push silver prices from $6 an ounce to over $50 an ounce within a year more than three decades ago, he said.
""We've kept track of absolutely everything,"" he said. ""That's in our extras section, or the information section on Wall Streets Silver reddit. We literally have a section for Wall Streets Bets posts for silver that they've deleted or kept up.""
But anyone attempting to post about silver on WSB, including Bayoukhi, was banned from the community because the majority of them didn't want focus to stray from GameStop, he said. Still, at least 30 to 40% of the WSB forum loves silver, he said. This indicates there was conflicting opinion among members of the subreddit, with some wanting to continue the GameStop short-squeeze, while others wanted to expand it to silver.
""That's why most of their users are coming to us for silver, because they're tired of just talking about one stock all day.""
Shortly after Reddit day traders drove up the prices of GameStop earlier this year, silver prices rocketed to their highest since 2013, driven by messages urging Reddit day traders to buy the metal and hike its price. Some members of the community claimed to not be a part of it and banned posts that mentioned silver. 
Bayoukhi compared silver to fiat currencies. When asked why he likes silver, he said traditional currencies aren't backed by anything and 99% of them have failed historically. On the other hand, silver is used in everyday life, such as in solar panels or industrial goods, has affordability, and works as a real store of value and hedge against inflation, he said.

Jane Street Poaches Senior Volatility Trader Katzman From Barclays,https://www.businessinsider.com/jane-street-poaches-senior-volatility-trader-aaron-katzman-options-barclays-2021-3,"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Quant trading firm Jane Street has poached a senior equity derivatives trader from Barclays to focus on the swings of individual stocks that have catalyzed markets thus far in 2021. 
Aaron Katzman is joining Jane Street as a single-stock options trader, according to sources familiar with the matter. A Barclays lifer, Katzman joined the bank in 2008 and rose to managing director on the equity volatility desk, with a focus on tech stocks, the sources said.
Jane Street is a proprietary trading firm and quietly one of the world's largest market makers, trading $17 trillion worth of securities last year, according to the Financial Times.
A representative at Barclays declined to comment. Jane Street did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Equity volatility traders are in high demand after a year flush with market shocks that pushed derivatives trading to its highest levels in a decade — producing monster trading revenues for banks in the process. 
Markets have remained jumpy in 2021, and the whipsawing of individual securities has stolen the show. Stocks like Tesla, GameStop, AMC, and Palantir have drawn heavy trading flow from retail investors — who are increasingly buying options — rapidly appreciating and falling in short succession.
Intense trading of GameStop and other ""meme stocks"" popularized on Reddit's Wall Street Bets forum created a bloodbath in January for hedge funds that shorted the stocks, as well as firms forced into selling off positions to reduce their overall exposure.
The traders that specialize in navigating such swings have become all the more relevant and valuable in the process. 
Jane Street is perhaps best known for its work with exchange-traded funds, but the firm handled $4 trillion in equity trading volume in 2020 on the way to a record year, generating $6.3 billion in adjusted profits in the first half of 2020 — a tenfold increase up from the first six months of 2019, according to the report from the FT.

Former moderators of Reddit's WallStreetBets want to start their own 'decentralized' community,https://www.businessinsider.com/wallstreetbets-reddit-sub-stock-moderators-want-to-start-new-community-2021-3,"Tue, 02 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Former moderators of WallStreetBets, the subreddit famed for sparking the GameStop stock buying spree that inspired international headlines and movie deals, are not happy with what the sub has evolved into. Now they want to strike out on their own in a new community.
On February 4, Reddit moderators on WallStreetBets removed two fellow mods, zjz and jamsi, in what has been described as a ""coup"" over a potential movie deal. The NY Times wrote that ""WallStreetBets moderators who were considering the film deal began booting out other moderators who had questioned them for secretly trying to profit from the forum's success."" 
Over the next week, three other moderators would step down before Reddit administrators got involved and removed the offending moderators. Since then, zjz has been reinstated as a moderator, but the others that were removed have been sharing what they believe to be fundamental issues with WallStreetBets.
A moderator's job on Reddit is to filter through comments, removing spam and ensuring Redditors are following the site's guidelines. With 9.4 million subscribers on Wall StreetBets that want to talk about GameStop stock and ""tendies,"" having good moderators is crucial for this subreddit's survival.
On Monday, the WallStreetBets moderator Twitter account, which is now being run by a group of former moderators, tweeted out a message to the WallStreetBets community from the old moderators. The account announced that they want to create a ""decentralized"" hub of communication called WallStreetBets 2.0 that uses ""smart contracts,"" which is the same system used to trade blockchain cryptocurrency.  
 
""It's time to stop using centralized platforms that can shut us down without warning,"" the post says. ""It's time to stop using a broken financial system that is archaic and inefficient. It's time to decentralize.""
The site also has a page talking about the ""coup"" which they believe was started because ""some of the remaining moderators intentionally spread false information in order to sieze (sic) control for themselves."" They claim that all money that would have been received for the movie deal would have gone to charity and that current moderator zjz had shared an edited screenshot to the NY Times implying that they were taking the money for themselves.
""We have no issue with them except that they lied in order to get us removed from the sub,"" the former moderators said over email. ""We also clearly disagree on the decentralization issue."" About nine former moderators ""are supportive of this, but not all will be involved as part of the team building."" 
Zjz wrote on Reddit that the wsbmods Twitter account ""was made by the previous tenants of the mod team""  and that he ""endorsed it at the time because it appeared to be necessary, but now it's just a bunch of unaffiliated people pretending to be us and giving interviews as if they're still here."" 
Zjz also said that the former mods ""didn't contribute"" to moderating the subreddit. The former moderators dispute that claim, telling Insider that they did impact the sub by ""setting up AMAs"" and ""communicated with the other mods frequently."" 
""To say that we were inactive and uninvolved with the sub until the GME event is categorically false,"" the former moderators said. ""We did let zjz and his bots take over more and more of the day-to-day moderating because that was working well.""
Most of the bots and moderation tools used by WallStreetBets moderators were created by zjz and the subreddit struggled to handle the wave of new users. The original mods said that they banned zjz because ""he was freaking the community out with lies"" in regards to his post about the coup and ""we were trying to prevent the community from being destabilized.""
10 days after his ban, zjz was brought back onto WallStreetBets to moderate the sub. On Monday,  zjz shared an official Twitter account for the current monderators and wrote  that ""unaffiliated people are impersonating us on Twitter and it's causing major issues."" 
 
Though the movie deal may have been the catalyst for the break, there seemed to be a clear divide on the moderator's opinions on cryptocurrency. 
""They have warped views on crypto based on outdated experiences from many years ago when crypto was brand new and scams were everywhere,"" the old mods wrote. They referred to our plan to decentralize WSB as 'some crypto shit'"".
In response to a user's question on Reddit about the posts, zjz wrote that they were ""trying to run a crypto scam on wallstreetbets"" and described their new site as a ""decentralized crypto-based wallstreetbets.""
One of the mods removed in the initial wave was jamsi (not a part of the WallStreetBets 2.0), who claims to be a 13-year-veteran of internet moderation and had only worked on the sub for a week before getting removed. While zjz has rejoined the sub, jamsi still has not and does not plan on it because they believe that there is a ""heavy amount of censorship in the subreddit.""
""Posts and comments are being suppressed and removed all the time,"" jamsi told Insider. ""Not for breaking the rules, but because they are not what the senior mod time want to see."" Zjz did not return multiple requests for comment. 
According to jamsi, the front page of the subreddit is being ""manipulated"" and posts with thousands of upvotes are being removed ""because the moderators personally disagree with them."" New subreddits have started to pop up in the wake of WSB's popularity like r/GME, r/WallStreetBetsNew and jamsi's creation r/HereWeTrade. 
On these subs, you can find links to posts from disgruntled users, confused as to why their posts about GameStop gains or memes about DeepF-Value are being removed. Though these posts could simply be getting removed as spam, jamsi believes it has to do with a moderator's personal opinion. 
""Certain tickers like GME, AMC, NOK, BB and NAKD posts and comments are being removed before they get to gain any traction,"" jamsi said. ""And the ones that do make it past the automoderator get their posts removed once a moderator gets to them.""

These are the kinds of charlatans who show up when Wall Street gets weird,https://www.businessinsider.com/charlatans-show-up-when-wall-street-stock-market-gets-weird-2021-3,"Thu, 04 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"In a stock-market bubble, it may sometimes feel as if there are two stock markets — one is normal, the other weird and almost entirely scammy. 
In these times, the portion of Wall Street operating in the ""normal"" market continues to do the methodical work of valuing corporations and investing in those it deems worthy. This market is boring, and almost no one pays attention to it.
The other market is dominated by loud self-promoters trying to pump fad products that will ultimately implode. Every bubble has these charlatans. Ask anyone who survived the tech bubble about Internet Capital Group, a business-to-business holding company that went from $112 a share in early 2000 to $0.34 a share in September 2001. The company was helmed by Walter ""Buck"" White Buckley III, and he liked to throw a lot of seminars with big-name CEOs.
Today promoting anything — not just stocks — is easier than it was back in the early 2000s, and today's ""Bucks"" are taking full advantage. Some, like Silicon Valley billionaire Chamath Palihapitiya, are promoting themselves and anything that comes from their brand. Others — like Robinhood co-CEO Vlad Tenev, that guy from Barstool Sports, and random crypto influencers — are promoting their products.
What they all have in common is that they are luring investors into a variety of risky fads meant to part investors from their money.
There are a few ways to tell if the person you are listening to is a bubble charlatan. For one thing, they can't handle criticism of themselves or their product. Debate — one of the most important elements of price discovery — is not tolerated. To them, short sellers are market villains. They also dislike traditional valuation metrics, regulators who put guardrails around trading or promoting, and — to ingratiate themselves with retail investors — other rich people.
You can also find them shilling free advice on social media and constantly calling into CNBC to rant.
Chamath Palihapitiya, founder of the now defunct venture-capital firm Social Capital, is skilled at all of those things. His success stems mainly from being at Facebook early. Since then he has perfected the art of raising money from people who should know better, and teasing a run for governor of California.
He is also especially talented at proposing things that already exist as if they are a genius revelation. Like taxes, for example:
He has also made money in the current special-purpose-acquisition-company bubble as the so-called ""SPAC King."" SPACs allow investors to raise money, buy, and take private companies public without the due diligence of a normal IPO process. Palihapitiya's SPAC, Social Capital Hedosophia (ticker IPOF), acquired and took Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic public in 2019. 
After a quick surge up, IPOF is basically flat now. This shouldn't surprise anyone who knows the nature of SPACs. A Harvard study found that while most SPACs ""issue shares for roughly $10 ... by the time of the merger the median SPAC holds cash of just $6.67 per share."" Lucky for those who get in early, though. There is plenty of money to be made through financial engineering and ceaseless self-promotion in the beginning of a SPACs life cycle. 
Palihapitiya also took a healthcare company that he backs, Clover Health, public through a SPAC last year. It is now trading below its opening price after short seller Hindenburg Research published a report on the company. Hindenburg said Clover failed to disclose that it is being investigated by the Justice Department for Medicare-payment fraud, among other things. After the report was released, Clover confirmed it had been contacted by the Justice Department, but it said the company had not violated any rules by not disclosing the inquiry. The company also disclosed that the SEC has opened an investigation into Hindenburg's claims. 
Did I mention that Palihapitiya hates short sellers?
Ranting about short sellers and ""the little guy"" on CNBC while hyping GameStop has made Palihapitiya a hero to the internet trading crowd. They are energized not only by duplicitous billionaires like him but also by fun kids making money on TikTok, random guys on Reddit pouring their life savings into failing companies, and no-fee trading app Robinhood.
Robinhood promises to give power to the little guy by ""democratizing"" trading. Whenever anyone on Wall Street promises to do that, you can be almost sure they are a charlatan. Nothing in this business is ""free,"" and selling the premise that little guys can swim with Wall Street firms using trading algorithms created by physicists is idiotic. Would you expect to win a pickup game with LeBron? No.
Yet that is what Vlad Tenev, the co-CEO of Robinhood, is selling with a side of ""eat the rich.""
During last month's GameStop hearing in Congress, Tenev made it abundantly clear that he has no intention of fixing what caused trading restrictions on his addictive platform. To deflect from his company's actual problems, Tenev suggested a technical regulatory change that every expert agrees would do nothing to fix the issues exposed by the GameStop saga and could actually hurt the ""little guy"" investor.
The real problem was the fact that Tenev's gamified platform allows novice traders to take on large amounts of debt to then invest with, and the fact that regulators want to make sure platforms like Robinhood have the cash on hand to keep things going if those risky traders go bust. So when Robinhood restricted users' ability to buy meme stocks, the market and its regulations were working exactly as they should. Tenev had to pause because he didn't have the cash on hand to keep letting his users take huge risks. That's how this works.
And, yes, I know he raised $3.4 billion to deal with capital issues. I also know that — given the way people trade on his platform — that may not be enough.
In this bubbly market, people will get their faces ripped off on Robinhood even when things are functioning perfectly well. And by people I mean that guy from Barstool Sports, noted bag holder Dave Portnoy. A bag holder is someone who is known up and down Wall Street for being bad at trading stocks. And Portnoy's $700,000 loss on GameStop and other meme stocks (in a mere 48-plus hours) cemented him in the annals of bag-holder history in January.
Lucky for him, though, trading is not the only lucrative business on Wall Street. Pumping nonsense — especially during a bubble — is an occupation that is always available for anyone who is incapable of embarrassment.
Portnoy seems to possess that quality. At the moment he is pumping an exchange-traded fund that tracks sentiment for stocks on social media. Yes, the very meme stocks he took a bath on. What will happen to this ETF when people can't be at home all day trading on their phones? It's not hard to guess. But Portnoy will keep getting paid to promote it, and the issuer will keep getting fees from Barstool fans who buy in.
Can we blame Portnoy for pumping this fad? Not entirely. He's already made it clear to the world that he has no idea what he's doing in the stock market.
There are other bit players, too, like anyone who claims to be a crypto influencer. Candidly, anyone on Wall Street will tell you that crypto is a fun tool for speculation. Last month Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said she worries about losses people could suffer trading Bitcoin, which she called a ""highly speculative"" and ""volatile"" asset.
Charlatans will have you believe that Bitcoin is the next gold, or a store of value, or a hedge, or a new kind of currency we'll use after the apocalypse, or a unicorn that poops glittery $50 bills. The beauty — as someone told me when I moderated a crypto panel back in 2018 — is that blockchain and crypto can be whatever you want because no one is sure what it is or will be.
Now, for anyone on Wall Street who has seen these characters emerge before, their unleashing on the market is like hearing a dinner bell ring. Time to eat.
For these charlatans, it's time to be everywhere — until suddenly they are not. Some will fail into oblivion, others will recover and reinvent themselves, and just a few of them will make the right moves at just the right time and end up as a judge on ""Shark Tank."" There is money to be made on all sides of a bubble. You just have to make sure that you're on the right side when it pops.

While Marge checks the stock's performance on an episode of ""Crazy Cash,"" perhaps a parody of Jim Cramer's ""Mad Money,"" real-time data on the fictitious market channel shows bitcoin accompanied by a green infinity symbol.
Bitcoin priced at infinity seems to indicate the show creators are either very bullish on digital assets, or believe the system will crumble.
The screen ticker also showed GameStop's stock rising by 1 trillion, and instantly falling by 2 trillion in the Simpsons' world. Meanwhile, the TV host quips enthusiastically: ""Buy, buy, buy! Then, when you hear a rumor of trouble, sell before anyone else!,"" with no specific reference to a stock.
Tesla was another amusing stock prediction in the show, for which the ticker feed directly stated ""if you have to ask, you can't afford it.""
Cryptocurrency has previously featured on the show in Season 31, Episode 13 called ""Frinkcoin."" Actor Jim Parsons, who played Sheldon Cooper in the Big Bang Theory, referred to it at the time as the ""cash of the future.""
Past predictions on the show that surprisingly came true include Kamala Harris' purple inauguration outfit, the election of former President Donald Trump, the discovery of the Higgs Boson equation, and a big plot twist in ""Game of Thrones.""

Stocks to buy for biggest gains in the second quarter of 2021: RBC,https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-to-buy-30-top-global-ideas-q2-rbc-2021-4,"Mon, 05 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"With the S&P 500 breaching 4,000 for the first time last week, US stocks wrapped up a dramatic yet hopeful first quarter of the year.
First, the market saw the extraordinary rise and precipitous fall of GameStop and other Reddit meme stocks. Then came the Treasury yield spike that fast-tracked the market rotation that has put everything from high-growth stocks, Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs, and special-purpose acquisition companies under pressure. 
As if those market events were not enough to capture investors' attention, the implosion of former ""Tiger Cub"" trader Bill Hwang's family office sent shockwaves across Wall Street at the tail end of March. 
Against all odds, the market still managed to cross the 4000 threshold on the last day of March as President Joe Biden rolled out a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure proposal. 
Heading into April, market strategists are already predicting a bullish month for stocks based on historical data.
Over the past 20 years, April has been the best month for stocks, according to Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.
""I had to double check, but sure enough, stocks have closed higher in April an incredible 14 out of the past 15 years,"" Detrick wrote in a Wednesday research note as markets wrapped up March trading. 
Despite the prospect of stock gains ahead, risks surrounding the pace and extent of the economic reopening as well as the potential impact of rising inflation remain top of mind for many market watchers. 
RBC, which maintains a list of 30 high-conviction, long-term stock ideas, surveyed its global research analysts around the issues of reopening and inflation. 
The Canadian investment bank found that 78% of its global analysts were ""positive"" or ""very positive"" when it came to the reopening. With respect to inflation, its US analysts were a bit more cautious, while projecting that non-US stocks, as well as the energy, materials, and financials sectors, could benefit more if a pickup in inflation did materialize.
These views are incorporated into the updated stock list for the second quarter, with changes made to reflect ""a rotation out of companies that have seen strong performance and less upside, into names that have more attractive potential upside,"" RBC analysts led by Brian Abrahams wrote in a Thursday note.
Many of the newest additions to the list come from cyclical sectors like industrials and materials. The second-quarter additions are Canadian Pacific Railway (CP), Humana (HUM), The Home Depot (HD), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX). 
Meanwhile, they removed stocks including AbbVie (ABBV), Cigna (CI), Kingfisher (KGF), and Truist Financial (TFC) from the list after strong year-to-date performances. 
As a whole, RBC's top 30 global ideas list has returned 6.3% in the first quarter compared to the S&P's 6.2%. Since its inception, the list has returned 40.2% compared to the S&P's 25.7%.
The stocks, along with their tickers, price targets, implied return rates, and analyst commentaries, are listed below in alphabetical order. Those return figures are from calculations as of March 31.

The key margin drivers we see are accretion from its acquisition of Topshop and efficiencies and leverage on warehouse, payroll and other operating costs, as we assume all incremental benefits from, e.g., more direct sourcing in the US and economies of scale are re-invested. Accordingly, we project ASOS can generate £3bn of FCF over the next 10 years, after more than doubling its warehouse capacity and investment in technology – fuel for innovation.""

EPD has grown and should continue to grow its fee-based cash flows as announced projects enter service and ramp. The large market capitalization relative to the rest of the midstream MLP space should mean easier access to and lower cost of capital and better trading liquidity.

5 ways to fix a PS4 controller that won't charge,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/why-wont-my-ps4-controller-charge,"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"There are many reasons why your PS4 controller may not be charging. And those reasons can range from the minor, like cable issues or dust, to more major problems, which might mean you need to buy a brand new controller.
Before you go out and replace a finicky PS4 controller, it's always a good idea to first do some troubleshooting to see if you can get your device to charge again — which could be easier than you think.
Here are five troubleshooting tips to get you back to gaming sooner.
Sometimes controllers have difficulty charging directly from the PS4, but testing out the controller by plugging it into another device — like your Mac, PC, or Android — can help you narrow down the reasons why it's not charging.
If it's not charging from another source, then you know that it's not the PS4 itself that's causing the problem. 
The issue may not be with the controller itself but with the charging cable. Try a different cable or try using that cable to charge another controller.
You can also check the cable for physical signs of damage such as fraying on the cord or built-up grime in the plug. 
 
Built-up dust or grit may be interrupting the power flow and keeping your controller from charging. A quick pass with a wooden toothpick or compressed air may help.
Go to the Settings menu on your PS4 and under ""Devices,"" remove all devices from the list. Then, on your controller, press something into the small hole on the underside of the controller and hold it for five seconds. A toothpick or bobby pin, for example, may do the trick.
Finally, re-sync the controller to the PS4 using the PS button. If you have issues re-pairing your PS4 controller, see our article on how to connect your controller to your PS4.
Turn off your PS4 console and controller, and unplug the PS4's power cord from the outlet. Wait 5 to 10 minutes, and with the PS4 still unplugged, hold down the power button for 30 seconds to drain all its leftover energy. Then, plug the PS4 back in, turn it on, and see if the issue has been fixed. 
If your controller still isn't charging after troubleshooting, check if it's still under warranty with Sony or the retailer you purchased it from. 
If so, you may be able to get a replacement, or swap out some of the hardware, without having to shell out money for a brand new controller.
You can play PS3 games on your PS4 with Sony's PlayStation Now streaming service — here's how
How to connect and pair a PS4 controller to your PC using Bluetooth or a USB cable

Maverick Capital dominating 2021 while other Tiger Cubs struggle,https://www.businessinsider.com/maverick-capital-dominating-2021-march-performance-tiger-cubs-andrew-warford-2021-4,"Fri, 09 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"After the Reddit-fueled GameStop saga that ensnared funds such as Melvin Capital and D1 Capital, Maverick Capital's founder, Lee Ainslie, told investors that his $9 billion fund was poised to take advantage of the trading landscape.
Two months later, it's clear Ainslie wasn't bluffing.
Maverick is dominating 2021 so far, returning 20% in March alone to fuel a 36% gain for the first quarter, sources told Insider.
The firm did not immediately return request for comment.
It's unclear what moves Maverick made following January's market volatility. Regulatory filings from February for the firm's portfolio show that Facebook, DuPont, and Microsoft were the manager's largest holdings to start the year, and each of those companies have seen their stocks rise, with Microsoft's 17% jump since the New Year leading the way.
Maverick's fifth-biggest holding, manufacturing equipment-maker Applied Materials, has increased by more than 50% since 2021's start.
The impressive March performance comes after Insider reported in February that the firm's top stock picker, Andrew Warford, would be leaving the firm to run his own family office. Warford, a longtime Maverick employee, became a managing partner in 2013 and still owns part of the firm.
Fellow Tiger Cubs — funds founded by people who worked under the legendary Tiger Management head Julian Robertson — did not enjoy March nearly as much as Maverick and Ainslie. Lone Pine, Coatue, and Tiger Global all lost money last month.
Sources told Insider that Tiger Global lost 5.3% last month and is up 0.8% for the year through March. The Chase Coleman-led fund declined to comment. Melvin Capital also fell in March after chipping away its GameStop-caused losses in February.
The average hedge fund, Hedge Fund Research found, was up 1% in March and just over 6% for the first quarter.
The biggest Tiger Cub blowup last month was from a family office, not a hedge fund. Bill Hwang's Archegos Capital lost tens of billions in a matter of days thanks to highly leveraged derivatives trades that went sideways.
Archegos' collapse led to big losses at banks such as Credit Suisse and Nomura, and could be the impetus for the Securities and Exchange Commission to add more transparency to derivatives markets.

H&M now lets you hire a men's suit for free — if you can return it within 24 hours,https://www.businessinsider.com/hm-free-suit-rental-mens-24-hours-return-2021-4,"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Fast-fashion giant H&M has started renting men's suits for free for 24 hours.
This new suit-rental service launched online in the UK on Thursday and is set to launch in the US on May 13, H&M told Insider.
The navy-blue suits on the service run from sizes XS to XXL.
An H&M representative confirmed to Insider that customers would not have to pay for the rental and would have 24 hours to use the suit before returning it. Customers would have to return it in a prepaid returns bag to a dry cleaning company that is working with H&M, a company representative said.
Customers wouldn't have to pay for any minor damage such as stains or tears, but would have to pay the full retail price of the suit for major damage, the representative said.
The brand said it wanted anyone attending a job interview ""to make a powerful first impression."" 
On Friday morning, Insider was unable to book one of the suits online. H&M did not immediately confirm to Insider whether the site was having technical issues. 
H&M said the service was part of its efforts to be more sustainable, given that customers would be renting rather than buying a suit. The company launched a ""conscious collection"" in 2012, where at least 50% of an item is made from more sustainable materials, and has a goal of using only recycled or other sustainably sourced materials by 2030.

"1 in 9 people in Puerto Rico left the territory in the last decade, new US Census data release shows",https://www.businessinsider.com/puerto-rico-population-one-ninth-moved-from-the-territory-2021-4,"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Puerto Rico lost a ninth of its total population between 2010 and 2020, according to the newly announced 2020 Census data.
The territory's total population decreased 11.8% over the past decade, the largest drop of any state or territory counted in the Census. In total, about 440,000 fewer Puerto Ricans were counted in the Census in 2020 than in 2010.
Additional insights from the new Census data include:
Destructive hurricanes rocked Puerto Rico in 2017, devastating the territory and causing a temporary shutdown of its entire power grid, more than 40,000 landslides, and close to 3,000 deaths. The territory also experienced a series of destructive hurricanes in 2019 and 2020, including 11 that were categorized as magnitude 5 earthquakes or higher.
The federal government's response to the natural disasters in the territory took years to fully take effect after President Donald Trump withheld nearly $13 billion in aid until 46 days before the 2020 presidential election.

The majority of Puerto Rican residents voted in favor of US statehood in a referendum included in the 2020 election season. The House narrowly voted to add Washington, DC, as a state on April 22 but has yet to vote on Puerto Rico statehood since the referendum.

Meet Chipotle's chief D&I and people officer Marissa Andrada,https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-chipotle-chief-diversity-inclusion-and-people-officer-marissa-andrada-2021-4,"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Marissa Andrada has been called a ""people doctor.""
When Andrada, now the chief diversity, inclusion, and people officer at Chipotle, was growing up, her parents encouraged her to pursue a career in medicine. But Andrada was more inclined toward something sociological — people-watching is still a favorite pastime.
Andrada's curiosity and openness have been critical leadership skills during the coronavirus pandemic. Chipotle, which employs about 88,000 people, grew its annual revenue by 7.1% and opened 161 new locations in 2020.
Under Andrada's stewardship, Chipotle refined its approach to employee benefits and redoubled its efforts around diversity, equity, and inclusion. This approach may pay dividends, helping the chain attract new talent at a time when employers across the fast-food industry are struggling to find workers.
""2020 reinforced my belief that the role of HR is to help an organization grow through its people,"" Andrada said.
Andrada's philosophy on talent management is simple: ""HR leaders need to have clarity on values, with a deep understanding of who the company is and what it stands for as an organization.""
Andrada joined Chipotle in 2018, after stints in HR leadership at companies including Kate Spade, Starbucks, and Gamestop. It was the same year Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol joined the company, tasked with overhauling the brand's image after a series of scandals around food safety.
One of Niccol's primary areas of focus was Chipotle's work culture. Niccol previously told Insider's Nancy Luna that he and his team did a lot of hiring his first year. ""Corporations are only as good as the people they have and the purpose that those people believe in,"" Niccol said.
To that end, Chipotle began investing heavily in employee development.
In 2019, the company partnered with the education-technology unicorn Guild Education and began covering employees' tuition for a range of business and technology degrees. More recently, Chipotle expanded that program to include agriculture, culinary, and hospitality degrees. Andrada helped waive the 15-hour minimum requirement for employees to qualify for Chipotle's education programs.
That year, turnover among Chipotle general managers hit 32.9%, marking a 15.1% improvement year-over-year, QSR reported. Turnover across the accommodation and food services sector was 78.9% in 2019, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In 2020, Chipotle promoted nearly 11,000 employees, HR Dive reported, and more than 70% of the chain's general managers came up internally.
On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that New York City had sued Chipotle, alleging that the chain had changed employees' schedules without sufficient notice or additional pay. In a statement provided to Insider, Chipotle Chief Corporate Affairs Officer Laurie Schalow said the lawsuit was a ""dramatic overreach."" Schalow added, ""Chipotle will vigorously defend itself. Chipotle remains committed to its employees and their right to a fair, just, and humane work environment that provides opportunities to all.""
A global pandemic, coupled with anti-racism protests following the police killing of George Floyd, put extra pressure on Andrada and her team to support employee wellbeing.
Early in 2020, Andrada led Chipotle in expanding its employee assistance program to all employees, so that they could reach licensed professional counselors. Chipotle also provides health advocates to help employees navigate healthcare costs. Between March and September 2020, according to Chipotle, the number of employees using Chipotle's EAP and advocacy services increased fourfold.
Andrada's parents immigrated to the US from the Philippines and she considers herself a champion for DEI. She hosted virtual sessions on DEI that featured Black influencers as guest speakers and helped launch a new employee resource group focused on mentorship of employees from marginalized groups. Andrada also oversaw a partnership with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and the National Urban League as part of a $1 million pledge to address systemic racism.
While human-resources leaders need to display business acumen, Andrada told Insider that talent heads should also remember they're a voice for employees. She said, ""You need to like people, see the best in others, and take time to listen to their perspectives.""

Stock market correction: Market bear on 6 charts to watch,https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-market-correction-crash-market-bear-signals-charts-to-watch-2021-4,"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The bulls are continuing to run rampant in the markets. On Thursday, the S&P 500 hit another record high close bolstered by strong technology earnings. 
Now, with the Federal Reserve once again stating its commitment to keep interest rates low and provide liquidity to the market, the question is whether anything will slow this bull rally down?
According to a new report from UBS, 41% of investors are considering increasing their holdings in stocks over the next six months, compared with 12% who are looking to reduce them.
Market events also continue to resonate with a mainstream audience from the Gamestop short squeeze in January to the cryptocurrency and non-fungible token frenzy in March.
Just this week, Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban went on mainstream daytime TV's ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" to discuss the merits of Dogecoin, a joke cryptocurrency that has surged 119% in price over the last year.
Yet, some pockets of the market have started to see a slow down. Barclays released a new report this week that highlighted a decline in trading brokerage usage as lockdown restrictions started to ease in the UK.
Bitcoin (BTC) also recently experienced a significant decline of around 17% after hitting an all-time high following the listing of the cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase. And the SPAC boom, which was seen as representation of current market euphoria, has officially peaked according to a new JPMorgan report.
Warnings about potential market corrections have also started to grow from market strategists. 
Bank of America's US equity strategist Savita Subramanian expects a 9% correction in the S&P 500 by the end of the year, according to an April 14 note. 
Her colleague Michael Hartnett, Bank of America's chief investment strategist, told investors to leverage the ""pain trade"" in preparation for a tougher market environment after analyzing current bull and bear market cases.
Sven Henrich, the founder of NorthmanTrader, recently explained why he believes the stock market is currently in a bubble, while John Hussman, the president of the Hussman Investment Trust, warned stocks could drop 25% to 35% in the near-term. 
Now, Société Générale's strategist and perma-bear Albert Edwards is joining the list of market-watchers increasingly worried about fundamentals. 
""Maximum 'extreme greed' never ends well,"" he said.  
""We all know that investors have decided that US equity valuations don't matter anymore – a stance usually forced upon investors in a bull market when equity market levels can no longer be justified by any sane valuation model,"" said Edwards, in the note.
We broke down the six indicators Edwards cited in his April 22 report that he is watching and in turn, that investors probably should be watching too.
Market analyst Lance Roberts of Real Investment Advisors created an aggregate sentiment indicator that shows US equity market sentiment is at maximum extreme greed.
""This overbullishness combines with extreme levels of overvaluation and a market that is very Overbought,"" Edwards said.
In an analysis of whether a stock market correction is likely, Roberts calls the current exuberance ""nutty"" highlighting that there have been very few points in history where the market was this significantly deviated, extended, overbought, and overly bullish. 
""Without exception, the market corrected,"" Roberts said. ""Sometimes it was just a 10-20% decline. However, sometimes it is a lot more.""
The team at Advisor Perspectives created a chart that shows the average of four valuation indicators.
""I know no-one cares about valuations, but I'm showing this chart anyway,"" Edwards said.
The indicators collectively demonstrate valuations at all-time highs.
Jill Mislinski, an economic and market analyst at Advisor Perspectives, points out these indicators are not useful as short-term signals as over-valuation and under-valuation can last for many years.
But instead investors can use this to understand the long-term expectations of investment returns.
""At present, market overvaluation continues to suggest a cautious long-term outlook and guarded expectations,"" said Mislinski, in the report. ""However, at today's low annualized inflation rate and the extremely poor return on fixed-income investments (Treasuries, CDs, etc.) the appeal of equities, despite overvaluation risk, is not surprising.""
A regression analysis from Michal Stupavsky, an investment strategist at Conseq Investment Management, shows investors should expect extremely weak returns for US stocks over the five years.
""At best, US stock performance should be around zero,"" Stupavsky said in a blog post.
The price-to-sales valuation indicator is at a new historical high, with the model predicting an average annual appreciation of US stocks over the next years at a level of -17% per annum, including dividends, according to the blog.
""This is, of course, a somewhat extreme forecast; on the other hand, it must be acknowledged that US stock valuations are currently in record, and it is precisely these valuations that are key to expected returns in the medium term,"" Stupavsky said.
""If you are looking for extremes though, the chart below by @MichalStupavsky at Conseq IM shows just how much of an outlier the current situation is,"" Edwards said.
Economist Michael Lebowitz also recently noted the four major valuation indicators are offering near-zero returns over the next decade.
Another chart from Lance Roberts of Real Investment Advisors demonstrates the S&P 500 has become extremely detached from the 200-day moving average, an indicator that determines overall long-term market trends. 
The detachment signals the market is overbought, Edwards said.
Some market analysts, such as Subramanian, expect a correction to stop around the 50-day moving average, which would be a 9% correction.
However, Roberts said  there is a risk of a deeper reversion.
""A correction back to 3800 would only revert prices to mid-2020,"" Roberts said. ""As shown, over the last 5-years, corrections have ranged from roughly -10% to -33%. Notably, these corrections usually have reverted the index either to the 200-dma or beyond.""
Considering the S&P 500's detachment from the moving average, Roberts expects a correction to surpass 3800. He said a 50% retracement seems more logical, which would result in 11% decline. But a 61.8% retracement also aligns with the 200-day moving average, which would result in a 14% decline.
""Furthermore, the entire market (small, mid, and large-capitalization companies) have all risen sharply in the liquidity-fueled advance from the March 2020 lows,"" Roberts said. ""Such provides plenty of fuel for a more significant correction if selling begins in earnest.""
Forward price-to-earnings ratios, the formula that uses forecasted company earnings versus current earnings, are elevated, particularly for technology stocks, Edwards said.
Edwards highlights this elevation is a recent development that occurred when Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell pivoted on the decision to hike interest rates between December 2018 and January 2019, supercharging the stock market bull rally.
""It is only a recent phenomenon - that is nothing to worry about, I'm sure…,"" Edwards said.
Rising bond yields are a threat to the technology and growth sectors of the market because yields are linked to interest rates, which are typically leveraged in the valuation models for these  types of stocks. Low interest rates mean higher valuations for these companies and a higher interest rate could impact valuation.
Although this a significant risk for technology stocks, Edwards thinks the even bigger risk could be a slide in technology earnings relative to the market.
Technology stocks have produced killer earnings results for the first quarter of the year. But Edwards questions what the impact will be on the stock market if there is a ""lull in growth"" and the economy is no longer receiving fiscal stimulus.
""But like everything else, I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. Nothing bad can, or will, happen. The Fed won't let it,"" Edwards said.

"Meet the rising stars of equity research, up-and-comers making calls on everything from the next big electric car maker to the return of live events",https://www.businessinsider.com/rising-stars-top-young-equity-research-analysts-wall-street-2021,"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"The stock market today looks far different than it did during the depths of March 2020, when investors were coming to terms with the economic wreckage the pandemic would cause, and dramatic market plunges triggered so-called circuit breakers for the first time in years. 
This week, the S&P 500 surged to an all-time high, up 46% from a year ago. Executives are growing more optimistic about the US economy's direction as vaccines roll out. And so far this earnings season, large-cap public companies have broadly turned in strong results and guidance, Bank of America Securities strategists told clients on Monday.   
Yet under the hood, whole sectors are in flux. 
It remains to be seen how industries like restaurants, travel, and some retailers will come out of the pandemic, and the prospect of inflation in the US is starting to dominate earnings calls between management and analysts. 
Suffice to say, this is a hectic period for analysts tracking companies' every move against a volatile macroeconomic backdrop. To identify standout analysts and highlight their work in a crowded field, Insider has compiled a list of rising stars in the industry. 
To qualify for the list, analysts had to be 35 years old or younger as of April 30, based in the US, work in sell-side equity research at a Wall Street firm, and stand out from peers through their work. Insider editors selected the finalists from nominations submitted by colleagues, bosses, and investors. 
Here is Insider's list of the top up-and-coming stars of equity research on Wall Street:
When Aga Zmigrodzka was in college in 2007, her dad gave her a chunk of money solely so she could learn how to invest it.
She was enjoying the returns she was generating until the global financial crisis happened. It prompted Zmigrodzka to want to know about what was happening in the financial world on a deeper level. 
So she started researching. 
""That was my first realization that if you invest in the stock market, it's not just about your fundamental analysis,"" she said. ""It's about the whole picture.""
More than a decade later, Zmigrodzka is among the world's most successful young equity researchers. 
A native of Poland, where she first started her career at UBS, she's now a director of equity research at the bank based in New York. She is the bank's lead gas-utilities analyst. UBS' natural-gas team was ranked the top research team in the oil and gas sector by Institutional Investor last year. 
Zmigrodzka said she is most proud of her analysis of macro factors, such as this year's winter storms in Texas. She credits her curiosity and willingness to collaborate for her career success.
Outside of work, Zmigrodzka enjoys traveling and taking road trips. She said she doesn't have a favorite place to visit and likes to constantly see new places — a trait perhaps derived from the same curiosity that has helped her as a researcher.
""As a kid, I used to travel every year throughout Europe, and we did a trip to a different country every summer,"" she said, adding that she tries to travel to different places with her own children now.
If you know Aileen Smith's family, you're probably not surprised to see her on this list. 
Her sister is an Olympic-medal-winning swimmer. One of her brothers is a software engineer at SpaceX. The other is in flight school in the US Navy.
""To use an autos term here, very high-octane family,"" she said. ""I have a lot of drive and I'll call it tunnel vision and a get-it-done attitude when it comes to setting goals for myself."" 
Smith, herself a record-setting swimmer during her time at Columbia University and the oldest sibling in her family, has relied on this drive to propel her to an impressive career start as an automotive-industry equity researcher at one of the world's biggest investment banks.
While at Columbia, Smith interned at Bank of America and started there full-time after graduating. She's since risen the ranks from analyst to associate to now vice president of equity research on the bank's automotive team. 
She said one of her proudest moments so far has been her role in helping to launch Bank of America's coverage of rental-car firms.
""Obviously one of the dynamics that happened in COVID last year is the travel industry and the rental car industry was really, really volatile and is very interesting at the moment,"" Smith said. ""So that lit a fire for me to get up and running on this stuff, so we initiated coverage on Avis Budget earlier this year.
Smith issued a buy rating on Avis Budget in January, and since then its share price has doubled. 
Smith said she's also proud of her work as a mentor to younger colleagues at Bank of America.
Beyond work, Smith says she is a devoted fan of the Marvel franchise. When asked for her favorite character in the franchise, she paused, then made the type of high-conviction call you'd expect from an equity researcher.
""Thor. It's like choosing between your children because they're all great, but definitely the third Thor movie sealed the deal.""
It is not a coincidence that one of the best gaming, lodging, and leisure analysts around is also an avid skier, rock climber, and surfer. 
Ben Chaiken lives and breathes the sector he covers by combining his real-life experiences with an acute intellectual rigor. 
After completing a post-college investment-banking rotational program, Chaiken found equity research to be the most enjoyable and intellectually stimulating way to continue learning. 
While he says he fell into the sector by coincidence, the outdoorsman has a knack for distilling unique insights into his qualitative and quantitative research. Whether it's using a sports-betting operator's mobile app, visiting a theme park, or skiing down the slopes of a resort, Chaiken tries to test the products as much as possible. 
""Our investment decision is not based on our anecdotal experience,"" he said, ""but having a deeper understanding of the product helps us make a more informed investment decision.""
To stand apart in a competitive field, Chaiken tries to look through the noise in order to offer clients differentiated stock views. For example, he gave Vail Resorts, a mountain, lodging, and real-estate operation, an outperform rating in the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""Our view was that the business was going to be more resilient than expected, in part driven by the local drive to skiers and also a lack of other optionality during COVID,"" he said. ""The inability to fly and travel was going to insulate the core business, and that was really the moving parts that are going to drive that core growth above expectations.""
A cultivated industry network was also invaluable in informing Chaiken's differentiated view going into the pandemic. 
""As the ski season was getting started, I was hearing just from talking to my industry network that season-pass sales were stronger than expected,"" he said. ""They turned out to be true, and that's one of the things that helps insulate the business, which was this strong network of prepaid passes versus relying on single-day transactions.""


Edison Yu's passion for the markets began when he was in college at New York University, but he knew then that the world of mergers and acquisitions and investment banking wasn't for him. That's why Yu told Insider he's since found a home in equity research at Deutsche Bank, where he leads the bank's coverage of Chinese electric-vehicle and autonomous-driving companies.
 ""You have something about the markets, how dynamic they are, how they can fluctuate — it lures people and attracts people. And so to be able to just have your foot in the door on that and then to do the more deep dive, maybe the more cerebral aspects of the job — it's a good balance,"" Yu told Insider. 
Yu began his career covering tech companies at Evercore ISI and has also since worked at the Hong Kong-based investment bank CLSA and Guggenheim Partners. Since joining Deutsche Bank in 2018, he's made a name for himself by initiating the bank's equity research coverage of some of the biggest names in electric vehicles and autonomous technology — including NIO, XPeng, and Li Auto over the past year.
""I was fortunate enough to be covering auto, but more specifically having done a lot of work on EV itself, to be able to get on that wave and to be really at the front and center of that,"" Yu said.
A key part of his job, Yu said, is balancing his coverage between the fundamental analysis associated with equity research and the macro environment, specifically the relationship between the US and China, that also shapes the auto market in China. 
""Especially in the last three or four years, the China piece of any story has gotten much more nuanced, for lack of better words. It's the biggest EV market in the world, so by definition, one must be monitoring what's going on. It makes the job very volatile sometimes, but I think we wouldn't have it any other way.""
Yu said he makes a concerted effort to separate his work from his personal life on the weekends, and he said since the pandemic began he's taken up an interest in wine and also enjoys playing piano — as well as the occasional Netflix show.


Emily Chieng was still in college when she began gaining exposure to metals and mining, the sector she now covers as an equity-research analyst at Goldman Sachs in New York. 
As part of earning her degree at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, Chieng interned at one of the largest commodities firms in the world, BHP Billiton. While Chieng, 29, didn't love working on-site, she found a passion for the industry.
In 2019, after five years working at Goldman in Australia and then New York, she began covering Canadian oil-sands companies and last year began covering North American metals and mining firms. 
While her early experience working inside the industry was helpful when first starting out, Chieng said that what's been most helpful since is keeping a keen eye on macro developments as they relate to commodities.
""That global perspective has been what's super helpful and understanding the supply-and-demand picture of different commodities and what makes things tick has been what I've found most interesting,"" Chieng told Insider.
When Chieng first began covering Canadian oil-sands companies two years ago, she knew she wasn't launching coverage of new firms or a new industry. 
Instead, she said, her goal was to ""find something that I think was missing from the market."" To that end, she and her team built a supply-and-demand model for the entire sector, combining a bottom-up analysis of each mine in Canada and working with other teams at Goldman to bring in market-demand metrics.
""I think having that level of granularity was really helpful for clients who were specifically looking to play the Canadian oil-sands coverage because small tweaks in the supply-demand balance can make a big difference to pricing realizations for some of these products,"" Chieng said. 
Chieng said the connections she's made at Goldman have been invaluable throughout her career. She's the chief operating officer of both the Asian Professionals Network and the Women's Network for Global Investment Research in the Americas. In her free time, she's taken up cooking during the pandemic and also enjoys working out, a hobby ""that I've found New York incredible for.""
A Michigan native, Evan Seigerman has always found biotech and healthcare a fascinating subject to study. In high school, he considered becoming a physician, but in college, he chose to major in finance and accounting. 
After graduating from the University of Michigan, Seigerman got his start working for the life-sciences practice of the consulting firm Capgemini. 
After three years in consulting, Seigerman joined Deutsche Bank as a biotech-equity research analyst in 2013, covering rare-disease companies. In 2015, he transitioned to Barclays and worked under Geoff Meacham, who left to join Bank of America in late 2019 as a senior biotech and pharma analyst. 
""I've really learned a ton on his team,"" he said. ""From client services to how to think about the sector, to how to interact with corporates, and really just how to be the best biopharma analyst.""
In 2018, Seigerman joined Credit Suisse. In his role as a senior large-cap biotech analyst, he has not only dived into individual-company research but also stayed on top of the broader themes within the sector as a whole. That has helped him make some prescient and distinctive stock calls. 
In December 2019, he downgraded Gilead Sciences from neutral to underperform. He stuck with that rating even as the stock was rising as enthusiasm over the firm's antiviral medication remdesivir skyrocketed in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
He knew that the sudden price surge was unsustainable, recalling that the stock shot to $84 in April last year before retracing to around $66 a share as of April 27.
""It's calls like that that I'm proud of,"" he said. ""Even if I have an underperform rating on a stock, it is very important in ensuring that my clients, investors, and the corporates are respected and that the work I'm doing has the highest level of integrity.""
With a doctorate in microbiology and immunology from Columbia University, Joe Thome had ""a late-stage transition"" to finance, but his career in equity research blossomed quickly. 
He attributes his fast adjustment to two mentors: Eric Schmidt, a top biotech analyst at Cowen who went on to become the chief financial officer at Allogene Therapeutics, and Philip Nadeau, a senior biotech analyst at Cowen. 
""Working under them and their mentorship definitely helped propel me forward to make sure we're thinking about the right thing and really learning about that space,"" he said. 
Coming from a science background, Thome has the advantage of having grasped a lot of the knowledge that is applicable to the companies that he talks to every day. But he believes that a constant appetite for learning, a strong desire to dig deep into the science, and knowing how to work with a team have also been instrumental to his success. 
""I think what Cowen looks for in the next generation of leaders is someone that can not only do the work but takes charge of initiative on larger projects,"" he said. ""So learning how to use your peers, mentors, and colleagues in a way that is extremely productive is something that I think all equity analysts can do.""
Before joining Cowen, Thome already had a few high-profile academic publications on new scientific innovations. He continues to leverage this strength and recently issued a large report on gene therapy in order to help the broader investment community understand it as well as the trials and successes associated with the technology. 
""It's been really successful. We've gotten great feedback on that report, and it's really highly read,"" he said, adding that the team has also organized a conference to educate investors and clients about the rapid development in the area. 
Judah Sokel's road to equity research included a pit stop as an accountant.
""I would love to pretend I was born invested in the stock market, but I didn't think about Wall Street until I got to business school,"" he told Insider. He said that being an analyst has an education component that he was well-suited for, given his background.
""On the sell side, we're telling a story and we're here to educate clients,"" he said. ""We may not always have the perfect estimate, but it's our job to explain to clients what a company does, how it makes money, its competitive advantages, and what's going on in the market.""
Sokel earned an accounting degree from Touro College in New York and worked for consultants PwC and McGladrey, now RSM US, before going back to school for an MBA at NYU Stern School of Business. He graduated in 2014 and has been in JPMorgan's equity-research division covering business and information services ever since. 
Analysts are often told to specialize and differentiate themselves by becoming experts in niche areas of their sectors. But Sokel says he likes the business and information services sector because he can succeed by being more of a generalist. His coverage list includes the commercial-landscape company BrightView, the pest-control company Terminix, and Moody's Investors Service.
""From food services at a stadium or how many people watch a TV show, it couldn't be a more wide range in terms of the markets and industries that are discussed,"" he said. ""This keeps it interesting because almost anything can be touched by the companies we cover. I like to call myself a generalist on the sell side."" 
Outside of work, Sokel is an avid sports enthusiast who enjoys playing and watching most games — but his favorite teams are the New York Giants and the New York Knicks.
Kristen Owen didn't start her career in equity research right away.
After graduating from Kent State University in Ohio, she worked at a bank branch in Akron as a financial consultant before deciding to get her MBA at American University.
She then worked in wealth management in Washington, DC, for a year, an experience that has helped her stay focused on the impact her equity research has. 
""I think it provided me with a little bit more context to understand that the research I do — my clients are mutual-fund managers or hedge-fund managers — but ultimately the people who matter in that theme are our parents, our grandparents,"" Owen said. 
""Your research actually has an impact on individuals,"" she added. ""So I think just having that little bit of that perspective gives me great pride in what I do.""
Owen then moved to Philadelphia in 2013 to work for Janney Montgomery Scott in equity research before moving to New York in 2015 to work for Oppenheimer, where she has risen through the ranks.
Owen said her proudest accomplishment so far has been starting coverage of the agricultural-technology sector at Oppenheimer.
She attributes her interest in the agriculture industry to her mom's career in the restaurant industry and her fandom of the food writer Anthony Bourdain growing up.
Outside of work, Owen enjoys learning about New York City history and volunteers for The Trust for Public Land helping to develop new parks in the city.


When GameStop's stock and its army of devotees became the face of market mania gripping retail investors in January, Kyle Voigt's days as an analyst covering global market structure and electronic-brokerage sectors were busy. 
""For the first time ever, I felt like people really cared about the market infrastructure that was underpinning the US cash-equity market,"" Voigt, a managing director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, the boutique investment-banking firm owned by Stifel, told Insider.
But he's also seen days that made the meme-stock mania look like a sleepy trading session. 
""There have been times when I've had far, far more active inbound calls that were just nonstop,"" Voigt said. ""A lot of those had to do with regulation that sometimes comes up out of the blue, and M&A."" 
All in a day's work. Voigt joined KBW, known for its specialization in financial-services investment banking and research, in 2012 from the listings department at NYSE Euronext, where he started his career. 
Now he feels that focusing on a smaller set of names in his coverage at a specialist firm — ""going a level deeper"" — separates his research from the pack. 
""That's half the job,"" Voigt said. ""The other half of the job is taking the data and analytics, putting that into something that's readable and understandable and actually has a solid conclusion, which is also not the easiest thing to do, and also conveying that to our clients."" 
Lauren Schenk has spent her entire career with Morgan Stanley in equity research. Schenk, who started as a summer intern in 2011, joined full-time in 2012 to cover retail companies after graduating from Boston College. 
""I knew I wanted to be client-facing at a preeminent firm. I also wanted a role that would help me to further develop both my quantitative and qualitative skills,"" Schenk told Insider. ""And I think that's one of the aspects of equity research that I enjoy the most, the balance of those two things."" 
Schenk, an executive director, now heads up the firm's small- and mid-cap internet-stock coverage, primarily tracking e-commerce companies like Bumble, Farfetch, and Poshmark. 
""Being in touch with how brand names and product trends are evolving, how consumer spending patterns are changing — that has always been really fascinating to me,"" she said.
Today she's meshed expertise in covering traditional retailers with faster-growing e-commerce businesses, and early on she worked on developing industry models around the online-dating industry at the firm. 
Schenk first worked under a more senior research analyst at Morgan Stanley, Kimberly Greenberger, who she said has been a ""tremendous mentor"" through the years.
""She not only was my manager, but she was also really supportive of my career development internally: the promotion process, the coverage process,"" Schenk said. ""My work gave her the confidence to be able to support me in that way. But I always asked for more, raised my hand, and was really eager to not stay still for too long."" 


Michael Ng got his start in the industry when BMO Capital Markets ""decided to take a bet"" on him when he applied for an equity-research position despite his work experience being in mortgage securitization and consulting out of college. 
At BMO, Ng covered packaged foods and agriculture before moving to Goldman Sachs in 2013. Ng found success when the bank had an opening on its technology, media, and telecom equity-research team, where he covered markets like movie theaters and toys. 
Since then, Ng's expanded his initial coverage of media and entertainment companies to include stocks like the gaming companies Activision Blizzard and Zynga. 
""When I started out in equity research, I was very sector agnostic. I was just happy to learn about the markets, build a foundation of analytics, really develop my understanding of businesses overall,"" Ng said.
Ng said he's been able to leverage his experience covering consumer goods to inform his time spent covering some of the market's most visible video-game stocks. He's able to track consumer sentiment, like gauging the response to a product release, by keeping tabs on sites like Twitter and Reddit. 
""I remember when I started out my career covering toys, I used to spend an hour or two every week walking up and down the aisles of Toys R Us, quite literally looking at the toys that were on the shelves. Looking at some of these social-media platforms has been a really helpful substitute for those in-person channel checks,"" Ng said.
In his free time, Ng said he makes an effort to take time off from work and get out of his home base of New York City. ""That's the beauty of living in a place like New York state. You can go a few hours in any direction and get to the beach or get to the mountains or anything really.""
Like others on this list, Paul Golding, who now covers consumer lifestyle and payments companies for Macquarie, has an invaluable connection to the industries he covers. He began his career on the other side of the aisle, in what he calls ""the operating side of finance"" doing corporate financial planning and analysis at Disney.
""From a broader skill-set perspective, it was valuable in helping me understand what's happening on the other side of the phone,"" Golding told Insider. He's since been able to use his understanding of how corporations prepare budget forecasts and present them through investor relations to communicate with executives at the companies he covers. 
Since joining Macquarie in 2016, Golding has distinguished himself by taking chances on as-of-yet-little-known stocks. 
""I thought if I can put together a pitch for me covering something that maybe isn't really on people's radar yet, I could make a splash and get my name out there as a lead on something,"" Golding said. One company he began covering early on was Roku. In 2018, Golding initiated coverage of the streaming platform with an outperform rating.
With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, Golding saw another opportunity to drive his equities coverage forward by pivoting to include e-commerce and payments in his coverage universe. 
""Just because a traditional leisure analyst doesn't necessarily cover PayPal, it doesn't mean that PayPal doesn't have a role in so much of what's happening in the sector. These are all things that are interwoven,"" Golding said. 
 As a result, his coverage at Macquarie has now become a blend of ""travel and lifestyle, e-commerce, digital commerce, online stores and digital payments,"" he said.
In his free time, Golding participates in what the philanthropic arm of Macquarie calls a ""pro bono marathon"" that matches employees with nonprofit organizations to work through business problems and provide budgeting and financial advice. 


Paul Matteis did not plan for a career in finance. In college, he majored in psychology and premed out of his passion for biology and chemistry. After graduation, he got his start doing neurology research in a lab at Harvard Medical School. 
But working in a lab turned out to be an unsuitable profession for an extrovert like Matteis.
While trying to figure out how to pivot, he learned from friends and contacts on Wall Street about equity research, a job that involved not only analyzing biotech companies and drugs and making predictions about them but also talking to people.
In 2012, he joined Leerink Partners as a junior associate and worked his way up to become an analyst and managing director before leaving for Stifel in 2018. 
 ""When I became an analyst, I started covering more of the emerging companies in biotech that were focused on neurology, areas like depression and Alzheimer's,"" he said. ""It was through that area that I was able to leverage the neurology background I had from working in the lab and from school.""
But having a background in science and medicine is not enough, Matteis said analysts need to be specialized in order to add value in an important and widely-covered space such as biotech.
Recently, Matteis expanded his in-depth research coverage by hosting a two-day conference where he moderated 30-minute panels with almost 40 different companies in the neurobiology space. Almost 300 investors attended the virtual panels. 
Outside of work, Matteis enjoys skiing and running. He is also involved in the President's Advisory Council at his alma mater Skidmore College.
A mechanical engineer by training, Rajat Gupta said he's always had an interest in cars, how they work, and the parts and technologies that go in them. So when an opening to cover the automotive industry at JPMorgan arose in 2018, he jumped at the opportunity.
Previously, Gupta had spent nearly 10 years at the bank covering the electrical equipment and multi-industry and global communications-equipment industries.
""I got lucky because if there's one industry that'll be the most exciting in the next decade or so, it's automotive,"" he said in an interview. ""People are now buying and selling cars online just from their home, so there's a lot of stuff that's changing in the industry across the supply chain, which will make it really exciting for the next five to 10 years.""
Today, as a vice president covering autos, auto parts, and auto dealers, Gupta is the lead analyst on auto dealerships and provides lead coverage for stocks like Carvana, CarMax, and Lithia Motors. He's also a senior associate on a team covering autos and auto-parts stocks — companies that manufacture vehicle equipment like air conditioners, power-steering systems, and airbags — with a combined market cap of $500 billion-plus.
Gupta said the pandemic has given him more opportunities to spend time with his 2-year-old son, and parenting during the past year has also inspired him to advocate for better childcare and support for parents of children with special needs. These issues fit into broader conversations about mental health in the workplace, he said.
""Today's lifestyle has a greater demand on mental energy that's different than the previous generation,"" he said. ""It was always an issue before COVID, but now it's even more upfront — which in a way is good because it's raised more awareness around the issue.""
Gupta also likes to watch and play cricket and to travel. He graduated from the India Institute of Technology Bombay in 2009.
Robert Majek always knew he wanted to do sell-side equity research, but he became inspired to cover IT infrastructure and software after reading the venture capitalist and entrepreneur Marc Andreessen's 2011 Wall Street Journal opinion piece about how new technologies are here to stay.
""I've differentiated myself by developing really specialized IT and software product knowledge, which helps me do invaluable, deep-dive research as opposed to just earnings notes,"" he said in an interview. 
In his less than four years at Raymond James, where he joined as a senior research associate in 2017, he's risen through the ranks to become the firm's youngest lead analyst at the end of 2020. He has 15 stocks under his primary coverage, including Oracle, Microsoft, and Atlassian.
""I enjoy doing that deep, iterative research process by developing and talking to industry contacts and digging into projects,"" Majek said. ""It takes a lot of time to do that, but I've developed a knack for doing it well.""
Before joining Raymond James, he spent four years as an associate analyst at CJS Securities. Before that, he was an associate at Condor Capital Wealth Management. Majek graduated from Rutgers University in 2012 with an economics degree.
Outside of his day job, Majek volunteers as a mentor for American Corporate Partners, a nonprofit organization that helps returning veterans find a career in the civilian workforce. He said this work became a passion for him after his brother joined the Air Force four years ago and he realized how tough it can be for service members to readjust to civilian life. 
Majek is also an avid skier, golfer, and traveler, and he hopes to soon visit his grandmother in Poland.
In January 2020, two months before the World Health Organization would declare a pandemic and in-person events would grind to a halt, Cowen launched coverage of Live Nation. 
""I was very bullish when I initiated,"" Stephen Glagola, a vice president at Cowen, told Insider. ""Two weeks later, I hear in mid-February that there's this coronavirus in China, and then in Europe. The live-events business got hit square in the nose. There was no live-event business come March.""
That was an obstacle for Glagola as an emerging analyst, who joined Cowen in 2013 to cover media and entertainment and now leads coverage of Live Nation and DraftKings. He remains bullish on the name, which he expects will benefit from the return to in-person entertainment and has since rallied back to pre-pandemic levels. (The stock traded as low as $21 apiece in March 2020 and traded at about $83 on Monday). 
Glagola joined the firm from Barclays, where he was an equity-research associate covering retail and footwear companies. At Cowen he started working closely with Doug Creutz, a managing director and senior research analyst who Glagola counts as an early mentor. 
""What I learned from Doug was trying to be as differentiated as possible,"" he said. ""This is a people business, too. I can't stress that enough.""
Glagola had an early interest in finance, inspired by the likes of Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham, and around his sophomore year of college started thinking more seriously about what field he wanted to pursue. He was drawn to the idea of becoming an analyst who could constantly learn new things through his work. 
""The market's very exciting to me. It's a three-dimensional puzzle. The whole world is changing constantly. The businesses and stocks we cover are changing constantly, and nothing is stable.""
As a lacrosse player at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania, Taylor McGinnis would go to the practice facility during the middle of the day to get extra sessions in.
""I was never the person that was naturally awesome on the field with little practice,"" McGinnis said. ""That's something I learned through sports. ... I was always the person that kept putting in the extra time and eventually earned my spot in the starting lineup.""
The work ethic she learned through the sport eventually leaked into how she approached her schoolwork, she said, and has led to the success she's had in her career thus far.
She was hired by Deutsche Bank out of college, where she was a leading equity-research analyst on multiple software stocks, including Microsoft. Before moving to UBS this year, where she also covers mid-cap software stocks, she coheaded Deutsche Bank's software research team.
McGinnis said her success is due in part to going out and speaking with people with firsthand knowledge of the industry she covers. 
She also cited her orientation to detail — and so do her colleagues. Multiple submissions nominating McGinnis for this list said she has the most detailed model for Microsoft on Wall Street. 
McGinnis said the best call in her career was on the software firm Anaplan, when she was among the first to be bullish on the stock. Since its IPO in October 2018, it's up 137%.
""That was one I felt really good about because at the time, it seemed to me like the stock was reaching a bottom while other people were increasingly becoming more cautious. I was like, 'Yeah, I'm as cautious as you near-term and understand that, but I think that downside risk is limited, and when you look ahead, this isn't a name you're going to want to miss once things start normalizing,'"" she said. ""Then over time, I saw many people who had previously downgraded the stock, upgrade it after the stock had already materially appreciated.""
Going to college in San Francisco in the late 2000s inspired Tyler Radke's passion for software and technology.
""This was the middle of the recession in 2009, and I was in the heart of tech innovation,"" he told Insider. Many of his close friends, along with his wife, worked in tech, which gave him a way in to the sector and a strong network early on. 
After graduating from the University of San Francisco a year early in 2012, where he majored in business, Radke joined Lazard Capital Markets as an equity research intern and later associate covering semiconductors before moving to MKM Partners in 2013 to cover enterprise software. He jumped to Citi as a senior associate in 2014 and has spent the past seven years climbing the ranks of the software-equity research team. 
At the beginning of the year, he became a director and senior equity-research analyst covering software at Citi, where he's the lead analyst on 31 stocks, including Oracle, Microsoft, and Palantir.
""I like equity research because I get to interact with some of the smartest people in the world and learn from them new ways to look at financial markets, tech companies, and technologies,"" Radke said. He added that no two days are the same at his job and that the relationships he's been able to build in the sector have been incredibly rewarding. 
Since his day job is largely spent in front of computer screens to understand the software that goes into the machines, Radke says that he tries to unplug as much as possible when he's not at work. He's big on winter sports, like skiing, as well as other outdoor activities, and he said he's looking forward to traveling and eating at restaurants when it's safe to do so again.
Radke married his wife last year in the midst of the pandemic, and the two had to put their honeymoon — an African safari — on hold. He says he hopes they'll be able to go later this year.

"Reddit Frenzy Forced D1 to Change Shorting Strategy, Sundheim Says",https://www.businessinsider.com/d1-dan-sundheim-reddit-gamestop-frenzy-short-strategy-2021-5,"Wed, 12 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Dan Sundheim is taking Gabe Plotkin's advice.
Sundheim, the billionaire founder of  D1 Capital, which manages $20 billion, said at the Sohn Investment Conference Wednesday that his firm had changed its shorting strategy in response to the social-media-fueled trading frenzy that sent companies like GameStop and AMC soaring in January.
Plotkin's Melvin Capital was the target for many of these traders, who communicated with each other in the popular Reddit channel Wall Street Bets, after his short positions against GameStop were disclosed in regulatory filings. The resulting short squeeze caused Melvin to lose more than 50% of its capital in a month, while D1 fell by more than 20% thanks to a short position against AMC. 
At a congressional hearing on the phenomenon, Plotkin said asset managers would most likely need to adjust their shorting strategies because of traders' ability to use social media to rally against a position.
The overall size of short positions at D1 is now smaller, Sundheim said in a conversation with Stripe cofounder John Collison.
""We haven't given it up, but we have altered our approach,"" he said.
He added that he wanted to keep his investing team small and focus more on private investments and long positions in public companies, where there's more of a chance for alpha.
""As you get bigger, shorting becomes harder,"" he said. ""I don't think it's evil. I think it's healthy for the markets.""
He said his first big break in finance came from a short report he posted on Joel Greenblatt's website under an alias.
But he said D1's focus on companies it can hold for years meant he didn't need to short companies ""to hedge the companies I buy"" and that he was comfortable with ""short-term volatility"" created by retail traders.
""The gambling creates excess volatility, and you just have to be aware of that, especially on the short side,"" he said. 
Sundheim has mostly been able to bounce back from earlier stumbles, unlike Plotkin, recouping nearly all of his January losses, according to Bloomberg.
Still, when asked by Collison what advice he'd give young investors, he said ""don't short GameStop.""

Mormon Church's $100 Billion Fund Made 900% Gain on GameStop Stock,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/mormon-church-100-billion-fund-gamestop-stock-gain-tesla-stake-2021-5-1030442617,"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Markets Insider,"The Mormon Church was a surprise winner from the GameStop short squeeze, racking up a 900% gain on the meme stock last quarter, regulatory filings show.
Ensign Peak Advisors — the secretive $100 billion investment arm of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints — bought 46,000 GameStop shares in the fourth quarter of 2020. Its stake ballooned in value from under $900,000 to $8.7 million in the first three months of this year, thanks to GameStop's stock price going stratospheric in January and remaining elevated since then.
The surge in GameStop stock from below $19 to $190 last quarter also catapulted it from Ensign's 1,452nd most-valuable holding to number 455 on the list.
Ensign tapped into the Tesla craze as well, growing its split-adjusted stake in Elon Musk's electric-vehicle company by about 3,500% to 467,000 shares over the course of last year. It bolstered the position by another 39% to nearly 650,000 shares last quarter.
The fund's Tesla stake was worth $433 million at the end of March, making it Ensign's 15th biggest holding. It was 22nd on the list three months earlier.
Ensign trimmed all four of its largest holdings last quarter, but still boasted $2 billion stakes in Apple and Microsoft, and $1 billion-plus positions in Amazon and Alphabet. Notably, it slashed its stake in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway by 21%, pushing the famed investor's company from its 14th most valuable holding to its 22nd.

"From YOLO to diamond hands, here are 9 pieces of lingo you need to learn before diving into Wall Street Bets",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/reddit-wall-street-bets-lingo-guide-glossary-yolo-diamond-hands-2021-5-1030450777,"Thu, 20 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Markets Insider,"YOLO, the acronym for ""you only live once,"" was popularized a decade ago by rapper Drake. Now, on Wall Street Bets, the term is used for a trader who goes all in on a stock.
""A YOLO should be at least 4 digits and represent 98-100% of your account,"" said one Redditor who posted a ""basic guide"" to Wall Street Bets terms in March. 
MOASS stands for the ""mother of all short squeezes,"" a likely reference to short-sellers who have lost billions on their bets against GameStop. The stock has rallied roughly 850% this year, largely thanks to hype from day traders on Wall Street Bets. The company, which has remained largely silent on its meme-stock status, made a nudge to Redditors last week in a tweet in which it used the term, ""MOASS.""
As Vox once described it, the term ""diamond hands"" compares the strength of diamonds with a ""user's strength to last through big market swings."" A trader with diamond hands never sells, one Redditor said. On the opposite side, a trader with ""paper hands"" sells easily. 
Read more: D1 founder Dan Sundheim, whose hedge fund was rocked by the WallStreetBets frenzy, says shorting isn't 'evil' but that he's changing up his approach
DD refers to a person doing his or her ""Due Diligence,"" or homework on a subject. When a Redditor posts a DD, that means he or she has done research on a stock or market trend. For example, one Redditor said Wednesday, ""this is only my second DD,"" before diving into pages of research on ICE Clear Credit, or ICC. 
Market Realist reported in February that ""ATH"" stands for ""all time high."" It cited one post in which a Redditor said ""Me and the boys after the Dow hits ATH"" with a video of Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and a cat dancing. 
Buy the dip, which is often abbreviated to BTFD — with the extra F signifiying a popular curse word — tells investors to buy into a stock after it's fallen, in the hopes of it rising out of its slump. 
When users say a stock is going ""to the moon"" or ""mooning,"" it's often accompanied by rocket ship emojis. They're referring to a stock rising in price or their belief that a stock will rise in price. Amid the initial GameStop craze in January, Redditors on Wall Street Bets said GameStop would go to the moon, meaning the stock price would have no limit in gains. 
""Tendies"" is a slang term for Redditors collecting money after their investment made a profit. At that point, an investor could collect his or her ""tendies."" 
Stonks is just a rif on the word stocks. The term gained popularity with the stonks meme, which shows a bald mannequin in a suit in front of market data. Reuters reported previously that the term refers to volatile stocks hyped up on Reddit.

"Elon Musk calls the meme-crypto Dogecoin the 'future of currency,' predicts it will 'take over the world' on 'SNL'",https://www.businessinsider.com/snl-elon-musk-dogecoin-hustle-future-currency-2021-5,"Sat, 08 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Elon Musk didn't miss a chance to hype the cryptocurrency Dogecoin as ""Saturday Night Live"" host on May 9.
Multiple times during the show's ""Weekend Update"" sketch, ""SNL"" cast members asked Musk, ""What is Dogecoin?""
""It's the future of currency,"" Musk said in response. ""It's an unstoppable financial vehicle that's going to take over the world.""
Musk added Dogecoin was ""as real"" as a dollar bill that cast member Michael Che pulled out of his pocket during the sketch. 
Dogecoin is a cryptocurrency created in 2013 as a joke and a cheaper alternative to Bitcoin, but it recently shot to fame after Musk, fellow billionaire Mark Cuban, and rapper Snoop Dogg expressed interest in it. Dogecoin jumped as high as 40% the week leading up to Musk's ""SNL"" appearance. Musk tweeted he was ""The Dogefather"" during the episode. 
Musk also referenced the popular catchphrase ""To the moon,"" popularized by the Reddit group Wall Street Bets. Wall Street Bets was rooting for GameStop stock's unlikely rally earlier in the year. In January, Dogecoin surged 600% following Reddit-mania surrounding GameStop, Insider's Grace Kay reported. 
Earlier on Saturday, Musk also joked he bought his mother Dogecoin as a gift for Mother's Day, which was the day after the episode. 
""Well break a leg tonight, I love you very much, and I'm excited for my Mother's Day Gift. I just hope it's not Dogecoin,"" Maye Musk, his mom, said during the episode's opening monologue, to which Elon responded: ""It is.""

'Resident Evil Village' is the most visually stunning game of the PlayStation 5 era so far,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/resident-evil-village-review-ps5-xbox,"Wed, 05 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more

""Resident Evil Village,"" the latest game in Capcom's legendary survival horror franchise, launched on Xbox, PlayStation, Stadia, and PC on May 7. The game is a direct sequel to ""Resident Evil 7,"" which has sold more than 8.5 million copies since 2017.
""Village"" is also the first ""Resident Evil"" game made for the next-gen PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles. ""Resident Evil"" is well known for its striking visuals, and the extra horsepower of the new consoles helps deliver remarkable graphics.
Simply put, ""Resident Evil Village"" is one of the best looking games ever made, creating a haunting atmosphere that will stick with you long after you're done playing. Players can look forward to a game that blends cinematic presentation with tense gunplay and puzzle-solving as ""Village"" explores a series of maze-like destinations hidden in a remote European town.
Though we played the PS5 version for review, whether you're playing on a next-gen console or an older machine like the PS4, ""Resident Evil Village"" is a well-built game that should satisfy series veterans and newcomers alike with its stunning presentation and gameplay variety.
""Village"" stars ""Resident Evil 7"" protagonist Ethan Winters, picking up three years after that game's conclusion. After the Winters family is attacked by original ""Resident Evil"" hero Chris Redfield, Ethan sets out to find his infant daughter. The journey brings Ethan to a European village stalked by werewolves and demons, all led by a mysterious cult figure named Mother Miranda.
As Ethan's adventure unfolds, players find hints that explain why Ethan's family was attacked, Chris's role, and what Mother Miranda has planned. Players will gradually explore the legends that haunt the village through castles, factories, and swamps as they search for Ethan's family and work to escape.
For those who haven't played ""Resident Evil 7,"" a brief recap video with minimal spoilers is offered in-game. Ethan's story is not directly connected to the early ""Resident Evil"" titles, so don't worry if you don't know the series' history.
""Resident Evil Village"" is a first-person survival horror game; that means bullets are scarce and players won't be able to shoot themselves out of every situation. Instead, Ethan scavenges the village for resources and key items to make his escape. In many cases, solving puzzles is more important to escaping the maze-like village than actually fighting enemies.
Constant exploration is necessary for progress, and players are encouraged to learn the map and village layout to avoid danger as much as possible. Ethan can craft items using found supplies, and eventually a merchant arrives that makes it easier to resupply and buy or upgrade weapons.
If you just want to enjoy some gunplay, ""Resident Evil Village"" also has a special mode called Mercenaries that lets you fight endless waves of enemies until you die or the round timer runs out. Capcom has also included an online multiplayer mode called Re:Verse, but it won't be ready to play until later this summer.
""Resident Evil Village"" is one of the most impressive looking games I've played to date, offering 4K resolution, HDR color and contrast, and ray tracing on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Without getting too deep into the technical specifications, the environments of ""Resident Evil Village"" are beautifully crafted and life-like, creating an ideal atmosphere for survival horror.
Capcom's RE Engine continues to create some of the most realistic human faces we've seen in video games, adding to the expressive personalities of the game's characters. The lighting of indoor spaces feels particularly effective too, creating a dark, cramped feeling that stands in stark contrast to the snow and fog that cover the surface of the village. 
While ""Resident Evil Village"" will certainly look best on PC and next-gen consoles, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One owners will still be able to enjoy the game as intended, albeit with a slight visual downgrade.
""Resident Evil Village"" delivers atmospheric horror, gruesome monsters, and a fair share of jump scares, but players can control the pace and difficulty to limit the terror.
As a horror game, ""Resident Evil Village"" is designed to be challenging, but it does offer a casual setting for new players. Veterans will also be able to try the game on harder difficulties, including one that unlocks after completing the game.
Though ""Village"" does include an option for aim-assist, there aren't many ways to fine tune the experience. Players can expect to die a few times from unexpected traps or monsters, but luckily ""Resident Evil Village"" has frequent checkpoints.
""Resident Evil Village"" can be completed in about 10 hours, though that time could be cut shorter if you're more willing than me to run into danger.
""Resident Evil Village"" was released on May 7 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, and Stadia. The standard version of the game costs $60; the $70 deluxe edition includes several in-game rewards like a special gun, max difficulty, and a visual filter.
The $220 collector's edition comes with a map of the village, a statue of Chris Redfield, an artbook, and all the deluxe edition rewards. 
""Resident Evil Village"" feels like a must-play for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X owners thanks to its unmatched graphics and tight gameplay. It's a beautiful, cinematic experience that's engaging from start to finish, delivering a satisfying story that builds directly from the most popular ""Resident Evil"" game to date.
Survival horror isn't a genre for every player, but ""Village"" does a fantastic job creating a haunting atmosphere that spans castles, factories, snowbanks, and swamps; turning the game's destinations into an interwoven environment. 
While the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions are the most impressive, players on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One can also enter ""Village"" knowing that they're getting a complete experience. Extra game modes like Mercenaries and Re:Verse bring even more value to the $60 package.

"Kamala Harris and Doug Emhoff made $1.7M last year, more than Bidens",https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-salary-income-doug-emhoff-joe-biden-tax-return-2021-5,"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, collectively earned $1,695,225 last year, newly released tax returns show. 
Most of the second couple's 2020 income came from Emhoff's work as partner at law firm DLA Piper, according to Bloomberg. 
Harris contributed her salary as a US Senator and $293,902 from sales of her 2019 book, ""The Truths We Hold: An American Journey.""
Their income was substantially down on 2019, when they earned $3,018,127. The drop was mostly due to Emhoff stepping back from his law firm. In August 2020, Emhoff took a leave of absence from the company following Harris' nomination to vice president, and left the firm after the election in November. 
Harris and Emhoff paid $621,893 in federal income tax in 2020, a rate of 36.7%, according to their joint tax filing shared Monday.
Their income in 2020 was much higher than the Bidens'. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden earned a collective $607,336 in 2020, and paid $157,414 in federal income tax, a rate of 25.9%, according to their joint return. 
This is a substantial drop from 2019, when the first couple earned $944,737. The president stopped taking paid speaking engagements during his election campaign.
Harris and Emhoff have collective assets between $3.1 million and $7 million, Bloomberg reported.

Bill Gurley rejected Robinhood for misleading users: New Yorker,https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gurley-rejected-robinhood-for-misleading-users-new-yorker-2021-5,"Tue, 11 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Venture capitalist Bill Gurley reportedly did not invest in Robinhood because it made him feel ""emotionally bad.""
Gurley, a general partner at Benchmark who has invested in Uber, Zillow, and Stitch Fix, told The New Yorker's Sheelah Kolhatkar he did not invest in Robinhood because of oppositions to the app's business model. Robinhood gets money by using a third party to carry out individual buy or sell orders, called a ""payment for order flow.""
""It made me feel bad. Emotionally bad. Because I think it is misleading to people."" Gurley told The New Yorker. ""My issue with Robinhood is, I think their mission and what they say they stand for is not actually true.""
Robinhood is a commission-free trading app popular among first-time investors. The firm's website said it's aim is to ""democratize finance for all.""

But the app has high profile critics like Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, and some markets experts recently told Insider the app ""gamifies"" trading through flashy animation and incentivizes risky betting.
Gurley called for the US Securities and Exchange Commission to ban payment for order flow models during the height of GameStop's short squeeze. In early 2021, many retail investors, including those in the Reddit group WallStreetBets, pushed the price of GameStop up. Some said it was to burn hedge funds that bet against the stock.
Gurley, in the past, has said the payment for order flow practice ""smells bad"" and is already outlawed in the UK and Canada.
""If the SEC/government wants to ""fix the plumbing"" the number one thing they should do is ban Payment for Order Flow,"" Gurley tweeted in January.
Gurley gained fame through backing Uber in 2011 with $10 million, which brought Benchmark $8 billion. Gurley did not participate in Benchmark's latest fund, but will remain at the VC firm that he joined in 1999, Insider's Bani Sapra reported.

Bloomberg Intelligence's top ETF expert names 21 funds that tap into the stock market's biggest themes for the rest of 2021 — and explains why investors should consider each one,https://www.businessinsider.com/top-etfs-stock-market-investing-trends-of-2021-bloomberg-intelligence-2021-5,"Wed, 05 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"""I've always found that if you find 10 stocks you really like and buy three, you always pick the wrong three. So I just buy all 10,"" the investing legend Peter Lynch once said.
If Lynch has trouble picking individual stocks, the average investor probably does as well. One way to avoid that problem altogether is to buy ETFs, which let you invest in anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred stocks all at once. 
ETFs allow investors to track the performance of an industry, an index, or even a commodity, and can be a great way for investors to gain exposure to the latest market trends. But which ETFs should investors be watching? 
Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, compiled a list of the 21 ETFs that he and his team are keeping a close eye on this year. These are the ETFs that correlate with popular market themes, including SPACs, cryptocurrencies, and more. During the recent Bloomberg Wealth Summit, Balchunas broke down what he likes about each of these ETFs and why investors may want to watch them closely for the rest of 2021.
Ticker: ARKK
Balchunas' comment: ""This thing is a juggernaut, and what it really showed was if you really swing for the fences you can actually overcome the drought and the outflows that have hit active managers.""
""Part of the reason for that is a lot of portfolios have gone cheap beta for the core, and then they decorate it with things that are totally opposite beta. We call them shiny objects, and so Ark has become something that you would put on to your cheap beta. And so we can tell in the flows that most of the money goes to cheap beta. But a good section of it goes to the sort of really high active share. And, of course, the performance helps and you have all that come together and Ark has been a juggernaut.""
""The question is, can they keep it up? A lot of the flows came in recently and you can see, you know, when flows come into a hot strategy, a lot of times, it doesn't really work as well after. We'll see what happens. Right now I think she's flat this year, but it's something to watch. She is going to keep expanding her universe of ETFs, you can see that there's eight ETFs now, just launched the space one.""
""So Ark is something we're always going to watch. It's a very interesting active strategy.""
Ticker: GBTC
Balchunas' comment: ""This is GBTC, it's not an ETF. It's an over-the-counter traded trust. And it's going to have a lot of premium and discount action. That said, it's really a sign of this race for Bitcoin ETFs and until a Bitcoin ETF launches, the flows in this have been pretty good. I think it has $30 billion at this point, which is a lot.""
""There's now nine ETFs filed, we'll see if they get launched. We think September 30th is when we'll probably see the first Bitcoin ETF. If and when that happens, look for some people to leave GBTC or look for GBTC to convert to an ETF. Anyway, this is probably the biggest story going on right now in ETFs.""
Ticker: SNPE
Balchunas' comment: ""There's a lot of ESGs out there. We find the ESG [ETF] that's going to work the best is the ESG that is the most benchmark aware. So if you look at the holdings of this SNPE, it's like a lot of BlackRock ETFs as well. It's going to hold a Facebook and Exxon, and that's going to turn off some hardcore people.""
""But we think that the returns that are similar to the S&P will make a lot of advisors and institutions more comfortable. So we think that's probably where you're going to see the assets. We also like clean energy. Again, stuff that's very different than the index. So, TAN and ICLN and those are ones we're also watching.""
Ticker: VXUS
Balchunas' comment: ""So international has been left behind in the past 10 years and an ETF like this we're starting to see a lot more flows into as people rebalance into it. It's lagged the US market by a ton here, so has emerging markets.""
""You know, these flows and this rebalancing is going to start to add up at some point and we have seen a little bit of a shift to value in some of the left behind areas. So we're watching VXUS for this international play.""
Ticker: FPX
Balchunas' comment: ""We're also watching this IPO ETF, as well 5.5 this SPAC ETF [below].""
""A lot of people think of SPAK as the SPAC ETF but SPCX is actually the better one, or I should say the more pure one, because it only holds pre-IPO SPACs. So these are the ones that are real micro caps before they announce what company they're going to acquire. SPAK holds mostly post-IPO SPACs. So this is the one we're watching and now it's the biggest SPAC ETF. People are noticing it because they want that purity.""
Ticker: SPCX
Balchunas' comment: See above.
Ticker: TQQQ
Balchunas' comment: ""TQQQ and SQQQ. These are leveraged Q's, these are the popular ETFs with the Robinhood crowd. So, we're watching these to see what's going on with Robinhood because you look into the volume of SQQQ and TQQQ, and that's a good gauge for how active the retail day trader is. And right now, looking here at the amount of volume going on here, it's unbelievable. TQQQ in particular is the fourth most traded ETF on a daily basis. And it's triple leverage Q's. Now, if the Q's start falling down, you're probably going to see a rise in SQQQ as well.""
""But when these two ETFs start dying down volume-wise, I think we're going to know that the retail day trader is starting to calm down a little bit. Maybe they're going to go out in the summer. Pandemic's over, you know, the market isn't as easy to make money in and we'll look for that as a sign. But these are two we're watching, they're leveraged ETFs punching way above their weight.""
Ticker: SQQQ
Balchunas' comment: See above.
Ticker: MSOS
Balchunas' comment: ""We're probably going to see more progress in the legalization of marijuana, and we watch MSOS because this is the only one that's all US. And the US market is, I believe, five times bigger than any other country, or in that ballpark, so a lot of the action will be here. This one is the only one that's all US.""
""It has a slick way of getting around holding multi-state operators, which is really an important part of the cannabis play and it does that by using swaps on the stocks. And so it's grown quickly and people have noticed this one as well.""
""That said, the returns in this area are very volatile and uncertain. Sometimes even good news doesn't really push it. Sometimes it rallies randomly. It's a very volatile area, but one that we're watching — and this ticker in particular we're watching.""
Ticker: URNM
Balchunas' comment: ""So obviously we call this clean energy for realists. We think nuclear energy is going to have to be part of the solution for the world to get to net zero, and this is one that's been popping on that news. And it was really, it's the worst performing ETF over the past 10 years, at least the index. But over the past year, it's popped a lot. So it has a lot of room to run as well, and it's one that we're watching for that play.""
Ticker: IBUY
Balchunas' comment: ""Obviously online retail is major, especially with the pandemic, and a lot of this is going to hang around. I think people are just done going to stores. What we like about this one and what we're watching is that it's more equal weighted, so you get way less Amazon. We think most of us probably have Amazon in our portfolio in a large amount somewhere else, so why double up that much? This gives you exposure to a lot of the other ones. So we sort of watch this one for a more proxy on online retail, not just Amazon.""
Ticker: QQQJ
Balchunas' comment: ""These are the 100 stocks that are next on deck to go into QQQ. So, it's sort of like the JV team and we think if the Qs are so hot, so popular, and the innovation in that index is amazing, it's just logical that this would be a launch.""
""I'm surprised it hasn't been launched earlier. It took, you know, the ETF industry is 23 years old. I'm just surprised it took so long, but this one has been an instant hit for obvious reasons and it's one we're watching.""
Ticker: GOVT
Balchunas' comment: ""What's interesting about this one is it covers the whole curve equally, and so we find a lot of people will go into here when they want a safe-haven asset but they want a little more yield, because if you go to the short-term you don't get a lot. We tend to see flows coming into this regularly, people like this, it's low cost, and this is one we're watching to see how people are feeling about the market as well.""
Ticker: VTI
Balchunas' comment: ""I think this is going to ultimately be the biggest ETF in the world someday. Right now it's third.""
""The reason is, this covers the whole entire market, it charges three basis points, plus with the SEC lending Vanguard does, the revenue makes your tracking perfect so you actually eat up those three basis points. So it's basically free exposure to everything.""
""And what's interesting about this is it's FOMO-proof, because when we saw Tesla get added to the S&P 500 so late a lot of people were mad they didn't own Tesla earlier. Well, VTI owned Tesla for 10 years, it owned GameStop, it owns all of them. So you never have the fear of missing out with VTI and we think more people going to come around to this and leave the large cap and the S&P 500. Not everybody, but there will be a migration and we feel like VTI is one to watch for that and you can see how S&P 500 was hurt by adding Tesla late."" 
Ticker: JPST
Balchunas' comment: ""People are not real keen to go into money market funds as much. What they are using is ultra-short-duration ETFs that are actively managed, so that it's a relatively safe place to park cash. Although it can move, it's not an avid one, but you get a lot more yield for that kind of a safety. And we're finding this area is very popular. MINT is another one from Pimco and JPMorgan, and Vanguard just launched one here. So just trying to eke out a little more yield for is being as safe and as low duration as possible, and that's a hot area and a place we're watching.""
Ticker: QVAL
Balchunas' comment: ""We think that the next ARK could be a deep value ETF because if and when value starts popping like it is this year, look for these ETFs here. This is our intensity rank for how value-y value ETFs are, and you can see FOVL, DEEP, QVAL, these will pop the most. These will double and maybe even triple the performance of the Vanguard value or the Russell value. And so we think the way that ARK was a shiny object on the growth side, one of these could be a shiny object on the value side, so we're watching these for that value comeback.""
Ticker: SLYV
Balchunas' comment: ""I think small-cap value is the most left-behind area, and so of course it makes us think that this is an area that might lead, right? So in the 2000's small-cap value destroyed the S&P, the S&P was flat. So things change, regimes change. And so we look for the small-cap value area as a leading indicator for if there is a bigger regime shift and this is one of the ones we watch.""
""IShares also launched one called, I believe it's called SVAL. And it's basically a really concentrated small-cap value. So it's also going for that shiny object potential. We do find a lot more launches these days are very concentrated. There's a limited number of holdings. So be wary — when you pick any kind of ETF for their small-cap value or total value, look at the concentration of holdings. Some are going to pop a lot, and some are going to be more watered down.""
Ticker: IUSB
Balchunas' comment: ""This is the total bond ETF. To me this is a better version of AGG. The AGG has been this easy to beat benchmark for bond managers, but when you compare them to the total bond market, which includes a little international and a little high yield, their beat rate goes down a lot. It goes more into lines of like equity managers. And so this is a fascinating ETF — it's growing very slowly, it's very cheap, and it gives you the whole bond market and it's a better benchmark for managers. So we're watching this one to see if the world will finally move on from AGG a little bit."" 
Ticker: SRVR
Balchunas' comment: ""Everybody thinks of VNQ with REITs. REITs are for yield, but you wouldn't use this for yield. This is an interesting play on data and infrastructure, especially if the infrastructure bill from Biden goes through. They're going to spend a lot of money on cell towers and that kind of thing. And that's what this ETF tracks and you can see it's done a really good job in performance, but again it won't yield a lot. Again, warning, I wouldn't use this for yield — but this is one we're watching for the infrastructure play that we might see happening as well as an alternative innovative ETF in the REIT space."" 
Ticker: GLDM
Balchunas' comment: ""Gold is now cheap. I think GLD is 40 basis points, now you can get gold ETFs under 20 and GLDM is one we're always watching. We also watch gold in terms of how it's comparing to Bitcoin. Gold and Bitcoin have this rivalry now that we're going to see play out and so GLDM, to us, is probably one that will grow bigger than maybe all of them someday because it's cheap.""
Ticker: DFAU
Balchunas' comment: ""So Dimensional came into the ETF space last year and what they did is they have active, but they price it at beta pricing. So it's a very, very low cost, active ETF here. And this is working. We think if you're going to do active you need to be really active, or you've got to be really cheap, and this one's really cheap and it's working.""
""Also, DFA is going to convert a mutual fund into an ETF, and it's going to bring a small wave of products that move from mutual fund to ETF. In DFA's case this is a $32 billion conversion. This, we think, is going to be the more popular asset-rich way for mutual funds to enter the ETF world. You bring your track record, you bring your assets, and you sort of start on third base instead of going into the brutal ETF market with nothing but this new launch, which is what some of them are doing through active non-transparent. So anyway, DFA taps into that issue as well.""
Ticker: CN
Balchunas' comment: ""China is a pain. It's all kinds of share classes, but CN is the easy button. It holds it A shares, N shares, P chips, you name it. We think this is an ETF that will grow if and when China starts becoming more popular in portfolios."" 
Ticker: SPD
Balchunas' comment: ""The Simplify US Equity PLUS Downside Convexity ETF is a mouthful. People are nervous the S&P is going to go down real quick at some point. So what this does is it holds the S&P so you get beta, but then what it does is it holds some really out-of-the-money puts and call options so that if there's a real quick move to the upside you can get a little extra juice on it. And if there is a real harsh move to the downside, you'll buffer some of it. So what they're doing is they're using options to sort protect on the downside, and we think this kind of option-overlay strategy is something we'll see more of.""

Meet 26 rising stars in public relations at top brands and agencies like Uber and Edelman,https://www.businessinsider.com/meet-the-rising-stars-in-the-public-relations-industry-2021-5,"Fri, 14 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Public relations is changing swiftly due to increasing client demands for more creative campaigns, better measurements, and counsel that comes from more diverse backgrounds, an enduring issue in the majority-white profession. And this hiring spree has made it more difficult to keep track of all the industry's new top talent.
Insider identified 26 of PR's rising stars from agencies and brands. The list includes people like Christine Alabastro, the executive communications manager at TikTok; and Kadrie Lamin, an account executive at the biggest PR firm, Edelman.
Their backgrounds are also varied. Molly Hendriksen, an account director at BerlinRosen, started out helping corporations navigate political issues, while Adeel Hussain, an associate director of social analytics at Ogilvy, creates tools to help clients with strategy.
We chose these people based on the accounts they handle and how they help their organizations' culture and recruiting efforts. The result is a list that represents all aspects of the PR industry.
Read the list below, in alphabetical order.
2020 was a chaotic year for TikTok, with the Trump Administration threatening to ban the platform amid explosive growth, and Alabastro played a pivotal role in managing the company's communications.
Since joining TikTok in August 2019, Alabastro has coached content creators and executives for media interviews, including TV appearances on programs like ABC Nightline.
Alabastro is on the board of advisers for the Center for Public Relations at USC.
Alvarado works on media relations, social media, and influencer marketing campaigns for clients like Baskin-Robbins, Truvia, and Dunkin'. 
When Dunkin Rebranded from Dunkin' Donuts, Alvarado developed messaging for executives, handled media questions, and planned unveiling events in Quincy, Massachusetts, home to the first Dunkin' location.
Alvardo also led strategy creation for the collaboration between Baskin-Robbins and Netflix's ""Stranger Things,"" a campaign that included press junkets with the show's creative talent, media and influencer events, and a pop-up experience. The program led to more than 800 stories and more than 3.3 billion media impressions.
Alvardo also helps the RF Binder recruit new employees and its social justice efforts.
If corporations want to know what to say during social justice movements — or if they even should — they need only ask Arlook.
A five-year veteran of the public affairs and corporate reputation firm, Arlook was recently named the practice lead for APCO's equity and justice practice and works with corporate clients like CarMax as well as nonprofits like the George Floyd Memorial Foundation.
She supports the George Floyd Memorial Foundation's mission to drive reform around criminal justice, education, and economic opportunity by advising them on strategy, digital communications, and corporate engagement.
Previously, Arlook worked with the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, which was competing to become the home of Amazon's HQ2 contest.
Arlook also was a founding member of the Junior Executive Board for Knock Out Abuse, a nonprofit based in Washington, DC, that raises more than $600,000 annually for domestic abuse victims.
Assevero heads up the diversity, equity, and inclusion practice at FleishmanHillard's East Coast team.
The Omnicom-owned PR firm has amassed more than 90 clients to its growing practice since its October 2020 launch.
Assevero works on corporate accounts like AT&T and JetBlue, helping with issues like corporate reputation, financial services, and crises, but she's also known for her pro bono work.
Following Fleishman's pledge on its 70th anniversary to volunteer PR work for nonprofits, charities, and other social justice organizations, Assevero helped Black History Month in Florence highlight the cultures of the African diaspora throughout Italy.
When Chow landed at the investing social network in January, she found herself in a potential firestorm around the GameStop short squeeze.
Public notified investors of potential volatility and let them decide how to use their spending power, gaining coverage in The Wall Street Journal.
Chow also helped roll out the announcement of Public's $220 million Series D fundraise in TechCrunch and get coverage in Reuters. She also helped promote Public's ""Break up with your Brokerage"" campaign.
Before joining Public, Chow worked as a consumer communications staffer at Reddit and led communications for media startup Pop-Up Magazine.
At Dentsu-owned Mitchell, Edie helps oversee PR for Walmart at a local level by promoting product and service launches as well as seasonal sales. Because of the pandemic's varying impact on different regions, Walmart has built different strategies for each of its markets, and Edie had a hand developing all of them.
When Walmart partnered with NextDoor to make it easier to coordinate pickup and delivery orders, Edie facilitated coverage in hundreds of segments in local TV markets across the US. She also boosted awareness of Walmart's COVID-19 testing clinics by getting the word out through local city governments, testing providers, and local media channels.
Grossman oversees every external communication released by Grail, an $8 billion early cancer detection startup that was backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos. She manages the company's image and oversees its website and social media, among other responsibilities.
Since 2020, Grossman has helped get coverage for Grail in hundreds of stories in outlets like The Wall Street Journal. One of her biggest assignments is helping Grail launch its first product, Galleri, a test that can detect types of cancer through a blood draw. 
Beyond her day-to-day responsibilities, Grossman also founded Grail's first employee resource group, for female professionals.
""In the next few years, I am absolutely certain we will see Kelsey in a chief communications officer role,"" said Matt Burns, the head of corporate communications at Grail and Grossman's boss.
As PR and advertising increasingly compete for the same accounts, PR firms need big creative ideas to attract clients. Enter Hager, who works on accounts like AirBnb, McDonald's, and Dollar Shave Club at Weber Shandwick.
Hager helped create Dollar Shave Club's ""PaintMyBalls"" competition, which asked men to write about  the importance of their testicles for a chance to win a cash prize. She was also part of the Airbnb account team that came up with the ""Only on Airbnb"" campaign.
During the 2021 Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, Hager placed second  in the PR category of the 2021 US Cannes Young Lions.
Though Hannigan joined the year-old Bateman agency only a few months ago, he is already known as a go-getter.
""He is trusted by client contacts up to and including the CEOs of [solar power storage provider] SunPower and [ecommerce software provider]Mirakl, and he has played an active role in landing new business for Bateman Agency including French multinational Thales,"" said CEO Fred Bateman.
Among his gets: He arranged an interview about cloud software company New Relic's chief HR officer for The Wall Street Journal.
Hendriksen, whose clients range from startups to multinational corporations, specializes in public affairs work for urban innovation, mobility, and sustainability technologies. 
For example, her work positioning Virgin Hyperloop One and its executives as leaders in transit technology led to coverage in CNN, Reuters, New York Magazine, and other outlets.
Hendriksen also spearheaded BerlinRosen's efforts to win the US agency of record account for Octopus Energy, a UK startup valued at $2 billion.
Hussain has evolved Ogilvy's data analytics capabilities by introducing new methodologies and products to clients.
For the lobbying group, American Health Insurance Plans, Hussain produced an index that can tell if news articles contain disinformation. His work on the Federal Emergency Management Agency account combined historical climate information with social data to show how communities discuss disasters around weather events.
Hussain also mined YouTube data to see how healthcare information and preventative care is explained in how to videos to help client Aetna understand how to reach YouTube watchers.
Krishnan's accounting background (she is a chartered accountant from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India) is a major asset at the financial and public affairs firm, where she works on high-profile assignments for SPAC transactions, IPOs, corporation reputation, and executive positioning.
Her expertise helps clients navigate complex financial transactions and the firm touts her as a ""driving force behind FGH's growing SPAC practice.""

She also worked on loanDepot's IPO and does corporate reputation and thought leadership work for Tadawul, the Saudi stock exchange.
O'Keeffe's peers consider her an expert at building relationships with business and finance reporters and helping position clients on sustainability issues.
For example, O'Keeffe advised LiveKindly Collective, a vegan company, on how it would roll out news about its $335 million capital raise. Her other notable projects include beauty and wellness SPAC Waldencast Acquisition Corp's listing on the Nasdaq, the $11.3 billion sale of Dunkin Brands to Inspire Brands, and Pfizer's spinoff of its $25 billion generics business.
Lamin is known as a go-to media relations expert at Edelman, where he handles accounts like McKinsey, John Deere, and YMCA.

Lamin frequently returns to his alma mater Morgan State University to help students prepare for the workplace. He also helped plan the firm's diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy and engagement with HBCUs.
Edelman recognized Lamin by naming him as their DC rookie of the year.
For a company of its size and profile, Twitter runs a relatively lean communications division and Lee's multiple assignments cross corporate positioning, crisis management, and media relations.
Lee played a critical role in how Twitter responded to the coronavirus pandemic when it became one of the first companies to move to an entirely remote working environment. His blog posts and tweeting about this move led to coverage in The Washington Post, tech outlet Protocol, and Buzzfeed.
Lee also worked with the company's CFO, Ned Segal, on Twitter's quarterly earnings and diversity and inclusion reports, as well as its first analyst day in five years.

How Pizzaslime perfected the art of Gen Z meme fashion,https://www.businessinsider.com/pizzaslime-founders-meme-fashion-gen-z-brand-diplo-record-label-2021-5,"Sun, 16 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Wearing the Bernie Sanders inauguration meme, sleeping on a pillow emblazoned with the Musk tweet ""Bitcoin is my safe word,"" and donning an ""Oprah 2020"" hoodie are all possible because of Pizzaslime.
Even the website for the streetwear brand and creative agency, where you'll see much of the merch mentioned above is sold out, is a play on the gossip website TMZ, filled with satirical articles and ads.
""Sometimes we're not even sure if it's going to connect with people all the time,"" said Nick ""Stove"" Santiago, one of the brand's millennial cofounders. ""We're trying and having a good time with it. And it works.""
Work it does. Pizzaslime has gained traction among Gen Z and DJs alike, appearing on influencers Emma Chamberlain and Addison Rae and on Diplo and Skrillex. While Pizzaslime found cult fandom in its early days, cofounder Matthew Hwang said it exploded during the pandemic thanks to the rise of TikTok, where Pizzaslime has 1 million followers. 
The merchandise line, founded in 2013, has acted as both a sly observer and ironic commenter on political, economic, and cultural moments that have gone viral. By offering an implicit critique on media consumption and internet and celebrity obsession, the merch itself tends to go viral.
In 2020 alone, the clothing side of Pizzaslime raked in $2 million in sales, peaking in April, according to screen shots verified by Insider (they declined to share total business revenue overall). That's a lot of stonk for a brand with only two employees: the 33-year-old Stove and 34-year-old Hwang. 
The pandemic has only thrown up more memes for Pizzaslime fodder. ""When all the WallStreetBets stuff was happening, it was energetic,"" Stove said. ""Me and Matt were waking up at six in the morning to text each other about stocks. Like we were in it, you know, it's real and authentic to us. And that was the [thing] we thought would be funny to make.""
The result: a typically Pizzaslimish graphic tee featuring a mashup of things easily identifiable by the young and internet-savvy: the logos of Reddit, WallStreetBets, and Gamestop; a fat pile of money; a stock board; and Elon Musk's famous tweet, ""Gamestonk!!"" 
Pizzaslime's success has propelled them to new ventures: the launch of a record label with Diplo last spring, their New York Fashion Week debut in February, and an expansion into film television. At the center of it all is the internet. 
Stove and Hwang met as coworkers, doing marketing and creative direction at a music management company, but not all their merch ideas fit the artists they were working with. So they decided to make T-shirts for themselves, wearing them backstage at concerts or events, and the entertainment crowd gravitated toward their designs.
As they tell it, the Kardashians were wearing Pizzaslime's Gucci-Versace-Louis Vuitton mash-up at a Kanye West concert. ""Kris Jenner just turns around, and is like, 'I love that shirt,'"" Hwang said. ""So I was like, 'Oh, OK. Let us contact you.'""
These organic moments of ""being in the right place at the right time,"" as Santiago describes it, put Pizzaslime on track to being the internet-savvy brand it is today. They count the Gucci-Versace shirt as their first big streetwear hit. Since then, their merch has flown off the site, from their Crocs collab that repurposed the shoes into crossbody bags for $300 to their ""Stop looking at my"" line, famously worn by Billie Eilish. 


Pizzaslime has tapped into the emerging trend of meme fashion before the powerhouses caught on, with major players from Balenciaga to Maison Margiela now in the space, Morgane Le Caer, content lead at global fashion shopping platform Lyst, told Insider. 
""Virality has become one of the key factors in determining the success of fashion products,"" she said. ""What matters to younger consumers is what captures their attention and has the ability to spread like wildfire across social networks — and this is exactly why meme fashion is so popular.""

Santiago was hesitant to use a buzzword like ""authenticity"" but acknowledged he couldn't find a better term. ""There's a real rawness and authenticity to what we do,"" he said. ""We aren't afraid to make a statement or post something and lose 1,000 followers."" He added that this caught on with Gen Z because it relates to authenticity more than his own generation, which he finds a bit more susceptible to marketing. 
""It's hard to define what Pizzaslime is,"" he said. ""For some people, it's sort of like a barrier of entry they find confusing. At the same time, it's given us the ability to build all these verticals and do everything and try everything."" 
But that's not to say Pizzaslime lacks strategy. ""We're not just sort of like throwing darts to the wall,"" Santiago said. ""The strategy really comes in with like, OK, now, how do we present the idea? How do we get this out there?""
Pizzaslime's greatest strength is its lack of definition.
The verticalization allows them to move in all sorts of spaces differently. The work, Santiago said, is figuring out how all of these verticals intertwine to fit into the Pizzaslime ecosystem. 
""We don't have to think like a traditional clothing brand because we also act as an agency and we're developing TV shows,"" he said. ""It's just all feeding each other and having a division for that, so what we're really doing is building our Willy Wonka factory.""
While the internet informs and inspires its creative decisions, it also helps them figure out what sort of strategies and mechanisms they want to try with clients like Crocs or Paramount Pictures for their marketing arm. Santiago likened it to a proof of concept — trying things with their own brand, only to apply those discoveries to the agency side.
Building out these verticals has put Hwang and Santiago at full speed. When asked for some of Pizzaslime's key turning points over the years, they took pause.
""We're going like a billion miles per hour because we're doing so many different things at the same time,"" Santiago said. ""These are interesting reflection points where like, 'Oh, right now I feel like I'm slowing down and processing this.' It's hard to pinpoint those moments because I'm always onto the next thing right away.'""
That they are. They're currently working on a TV project that Santiago described as an ""internetty"" version of ""American Idol,"" all while collaborating with Amazon on a new animated TV series called ""Fairfax."" And the first song of their record label, they said, just crossed 75 million streams on Spotify.
They plan to start plugging more into the label, looking at how they can tie music to products and build trends through products and sounds on social media, such as incorporate music from their record label into their TV show or collaborating with artists to put merch on Instagram. ""If we're working with a client and they want to make a TikTok campaign, we have the record label and the ability to make that TikTok song also a real song released through our record label,"" Santiago said.
While they've been approached by venture capitalists, they said they're taking the time to find the right strategic partners that would help scale up Pizzaslime.
""We want to jump into spaces and places that don't have strong internet voices or tones like we do,"" Santiago said, adding that he wouldn't be surprised if you can find Pizzaslime skincare at some point. ""We want to do some pretty unexpected stuff.""

Maplelane down in May after it began to claw back WallStreetBets losses,https://www.businessinsider.com/maplelane-capital-may-performance-wallstreetbets-losses-hedge-fund-2021-6,"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"One of Reddit traders' hedge-fund targets — $3 billion Maplelane Capital — took a step back in May as it tries to dig out of its GameStop-caused hole.
The fund, run by former Galleon Group portfolio manager Leon Shaulov, lost 2.7% last month and is down roughly 39% for the year, sources tell Insider. The manager lost 45% in January thanks to a short position against GameStop, which had its stock inflated by legions of Reddit-connected retail traders who were targeting to short squeeze another hedge fund, Melvin Capital. 
Maplelane, similar to Melvin, had begun to claw back some of its losses brought on by the WallStreetBets crowd with a decent end to the first quarter. Bloomberg reported that the fund made 6.5% and 2.1% in February and March, respectively, to finish the first quarter down 39.5%, but two months later, the firm is still stuck at that figure. 
Melvin Capital also sustained losses in May as it tries to claw its way back from a 53% loss from GameStop short positions, among other shorts. The Financial Times recently reported that Gabe Plotkin's manager lost 4% last month to bring its year-to-date losses to just under 45%. 
Despite the poor performance this year, Melvin has raised its assets under management up to $11 billion, the FT reports.
Maplelane did not respond to requests for comment.

"2 of the biggest hedge fund victims of GameStop's short-squeeze suffered more losses in May, report says",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/gamestop-short-squeeze-melvin-capital-light-street-losses-meme-stocks-2021-6-1030515597,"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Markets Insider,"US hedge funds Melvin Capital and Light Street Capital, two short sellers hurt by the GameStop day-trader rebellion earlier this year, saw further declines in May, the Financial Times reported on Thursday.
New York-based Melvin, which lost more than 50% in January over its short positions on GameStop, lost another 4% last month, the report said, citing sources. That brings its overall losses so far this year to about 45%.
Meme stock short-sellers have continued to be squeezed as retail investors remain bullish on popular names like Bed Bath & Beyond, AMC, BlackBerry, and Clover Health. Total hedge fund losses from betting against this pack of stocks amount to $6 billion since the start of May, the FT said, citing data from Ortex Analytics. 
At the start of the year, a number of short-sellers lost over $5 billion as Reddit traders formed a snowballing momentum trade that caused GameStop shares to skyrocket. Shorting a stock means an investor is betting a company's share price will fall. The opposite of this is ""going long,"" which reflects a belief the price will rise. 
Although the value of Melvin's assets fell $4.5 billion in January from the end of 2020, they have since recovered to $11 billion as of June 1, the FT reported. The fund closed out all of its public short positions, including GameStop and AMC, in the first three months of the year. But it could still have some traditional short positions that aren't required to be publicly disclosed.
Other funds with extended losses include Palo Alto-based Light Street Capital, founded by Glen Kacher, who started his career at billionaire Julian Robertson's famous fund, Tiger Management.
Light Street, which had about $3.3 billion in assets under management at the start of the year, was hit by losses on short positions in the first-quarter, the FT said. After losing a further 3% in May, its flagship fund is now down more than 20% this year.
Melvin Capital declined to comment on FT's report, while Light Street could not be contacted.

Sam Bankman-Fried Says Dogecoin Should Be Named Asset of the Year,https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/dogecoin-sam-bankman-fried-named-asset-year-meme-stock-crypto-2021-6-1030539878,"Mon, 21 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Markets Insider,"Sam Bankman-Fried, the 29-year-old billionaire founder of crypto exchange FTX, said in a recent podcast that dogecoin should be named asset of the year, given the massive fanbase the meme token has managed to rack up.
""If there is an asset of the year for 2020 and 2021, it would be dogecoin,"" he said in an episode of The Jax Jones and Martin Warner Show podcast. ""That is the asset that accurately reflects our current economic climate. That is the asset that we have all chosen, that we all deserve – for better or for worse.""
Dogecoin was last trading 12% lower at 22 cents on Monday, amid a broad cryptocurrency sell-off triggered by China's intensification of its crackdown on crypto mining and services. The digital token is still up around 4,700% so far this year.
Bankman-Fried said he wasn't attempting to either endorse or reject dogecoin, or even take a position on it. ""I'm just saying everything we as a society have decided over the last year has been dragging us closer and closer to the dogecoin financial standard.""
The meme token has seen its popularity explode this year after influencers including Elon Musk and Mark Cuban drove attention and support its way via tweets. Dogecoin investors bet on being able to cash out by selling to the next person looking to invest, so they can make a quick buck, and those comments drew a lot of new entrants to the market.
Cardano creator and ethereum cofounder Charles Hoskinson is among those who have warned that this situation is a bubble waiting to burst and that investors will be left holding the bag if they don't exit in time.
Digging into why and when retail investors turned their attention to dogecoin, Bankman-Fried said celebrity endorsements are fundamental to the token's future growth.
""Elon is a powerful piece of this — he is actually the most influential man in the world when it comes to financial assets right now,"" he said. ""Everyone kind of knew he'd choose Dogecoin. And we chose Elon. We signed up for this. We signed up for some amount of self-aware mockery, for some amount of a sense of humour, and for some amount of challenging norms.""
He agreed that dogecoin's value is not based in its underlying technology, and suggested people don't invest in it for the product or its roadmap. ""They buy it because it is just a funny looking dog and the fact that it is pronounced 'doge'. That's why they bought it,"" he said.
Bankman-Fried also discussed GameStop stock's sudden price spike, and decribed how day-traders are deciding what the value of such assets should be.
""The only surprising thing was that it wasn't a cryptocurrency, because that pattern happens all the time in crypto —it's not unusual,"" he said.
He went on to talk about how Reddit traders banded together to ignite the video-game retailer's trading momentum, and how that connected with dogecoin trading.
""The moment that Robinhood banned buying of GameStop, hundreds of millions of dollars flowed instantly into dogecoin. Directly out of GameStop into dogecoin. Because those are the same types of assets. People see them very similarly,"" Bankman-Fried said, adding that millions of day-traders en masse can decide the valuation of an asset after discussing it on social media.

Search warrant was executed for Robinhood CEO's cell phone,https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-ceo-cell-phone-search-warrant-ipo-filing-vlad-tenev-2021-7,"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Robinhood revealed in its S-1 filing that the US Attorney's Office launched a search warrant for CEO Vlad Tenev's cell phone.
The company, which publicly filed for an IPO on Thursday, listed the search warrant for Tenev's personal cell phone as a potential risk factor for investors looking to buy a share in the company.
It said the company has received several requests for information and testimonies, as well as subpoenas after Robinhood temporarily restricted trading earlier this year. It is also involved in numerous litigations related to the issue and said it has been made aware of 50 putative class action lawsuits. The company said it is complying with the requests.
""These proceedings ... may subject us to fines, penalties and monetary settlements,"" the company said in its S-1 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. ""[It could] increase regulatory scrutiny of our business, restrict our operations or require us to change our business practices.""
In January, Robinhood came under scrutiny after it temporarily restricted the trading of 13 equities, including GameStop and AMC. In its filing, the company said its decision to restrict trading had negatively impacted its brand, and could pose a future risk to investors.
Though the company eventually lifted the ban, it received widespread public criticism. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said Robinhood's decision was ""unacceptable."" 
That month, the company explained it had limited trading on stocks that had been fueled by the Reddit and retail investor trading frenzy due to a spike in its SEC-mandated deposit requirements which the company did not have enough capital to cover. Since, the startup has raised over $1 billion to avoid future deposit issues.
In February, Tenev testified before US congress regarding the restrictions and the GameStop trading turmoil. At the hearing, congress grilled the CEO over how Robinhood ""gamifies"" investing.
On Wednesday, Robinhood was slapped with a $70 million fine by the securities industry's self-regulator, FINRA, for misleading customers and system outages that the agency said hurt Robinhood's customers. In its public filing, the startup said it will likely incur similar fines in the future.
The S-1 filing is one of the first comprehensive looks at Robinhood's financials. In 2020, its revenue grew 245% to hit $959 million, while it reversed losses to post a $6.3 million profit. Though, the first quarter of 2021 saw a $1.4 billion loss amid the retail-trading saga.

"Simple trading strategy for meme stocks, best short squeeze candidates",https://www.businessinsider.com/simple-trading-strategy-for-meme-stocks-best-short-squeeze-candidates-2021-6,"Fri, 04 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Meme stock mania and its sequel may seem unprecedented, but whether they're really something new depends on how you look at them.
David Starr, vice president of quantitative analysis for the educational stock market platform Simpler Trading, says the titanic moves in companies like GameStop and AMC Entertainment are just contemporary versions of events that have always happened, like manias, collaborations, and bubbles.
That means there are reliable guidelines investors can follow. And they've worked well for Starr, who says he made a 70% gain on GameStop shares earlier this year with basic premarket trades. 
""They're trading for far beyond any reasonable value,"" he said. ""I do a lot of trading as opposed to investing, and quite frankly, as an investor, playing these stocks is probably crazy.""
True to the name of his company, Starr tries to keep things simple. He breaks down his trend investing practice this way: Identify the trend, like the dramatic moves upward in these stocks in recent months, wait for a counter trend move like the steep losses in AMC suffered Thursday morning, and wait for it to play out and present an entry point.
Just on Thursday, someone who timed AMC's moves correctly could have booked a hefty gain as the stock whipsawed from a 40% loss to a small gain before it finished down 18%.
A trader enticed by that kind of profit, or by the stock's eye-popping 3,000% gain in 2021, could spend days scouring r/WallStreetBets for the next meme stock or the next cryptocurrency that's primed to explode. But Starr says he has a more basic way to find the next big short squeeze.
""If you look for those with the combination of being within 10% of, say, 52-week highs and with a short interest as a percentage of float, say above 10% — and the more, the better — then those ended up being some good ones,"" he told Insider in an exclusive interview.
Starr is looking for stocks that a lot of investors are betting against, but where the prices have risen enough that a lot of those bettors are on the verge of quitting. They'll have to buy the stock to close their short positions, which will take the price even higher.
That can set off a highly profitable short-squeeze chain reaction as more and more people who'd bet against the stock are forced to buy it.
""You get the shorts needing to buy the stock, and that drives the price up more, which creates pain for even more shorts and that impact snowballs on itself,"" he said.
It's a risky trading strategy, since it involves buying stocks that are already overvalued in the expectation they'll go even higher before they inevitably crater. So he advises people to only risk money they're comfortable losing.
Starr says two promising examples as of Thursday are American Airlines and Norwegian Cruise Line. Both have rallied since their pandemic-period lows, but there are significant short bets against both even though the reopening of the global economy could send the stocks far higher.
Starr says the key to wrapping up those investments successfully is to decide on an exit strategy before buying. Otherwise, when a trade starts to go wrong, investors can end up justifying their incorrect choices again and again amid mounting losses or shrinking profits instead of facing reality.
""Nobody ever gets smarter once they're in a trade,"" he said. ""If you want to survive in trading, you've got to realize that it's more important to make money than be right. And if you're wrong, get out. But it's just too easy to rationalize once you're in it.""
In other words, when trading these stocks, it's better to have a rule — any rule, even a plainly imperfect one — than to try to wing it.
For his part, Starr says he doesn't have any long positions right now because he expects a significant pullback. But when that concludes, he'll look for newly-cheap equities.
""That may give us a nice opportunity to look for some names,"" he said.

'Big Short' Michael Burry Warns of Meme-Stock Crash As New Money Fades,https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-warns-meme-stock-crash-money-fades-2021-7,"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Markets Insider,"A crash in meme stocks is coming, Michael Burry said. 
Burry, who's known for predicting the US housing-market collapse that precipitated the global financial crisis, told Barron's in an interview that ""we probably do not have to wait too long"" for meme stocks to crash as retail traders and Wall Street are fully invested in the theme. 
""We're running out of new money available to jump on the bandwagon,"" Burry told Barron's. He likened the market froth to the 1999 dot-com and 2007 housing bubble that people thought would continue and said everyday investors are the most likely to be harmed. 
The Scion Asset Management head has made known his bearish view on meme stocks before. In his brief return to Twitter last month, he said, ""All hype/speculation is doing is drawing in retail before the mother of all crashes. #FOMO Parabolas don't resolve sideways; When crypto falls from trillions, or meme stocks fall from tens of billions, #MainStreet losses will approach the size of countries. History ain't changed.""
Burry, who was portrayed in the film ""The Big Short,"" was once a GameStop bull, paving the way for the meme-stock frenzy to come. His private investment firm bought a stake in the video-game retailer in 2019 and owned 1.7 million shares as of the end of September 2020.
His thesis began to play out as shares rose through the end of 2020. According to regulatory filings, the firm exited its GameStop stake by the end of the year — missing out on the stock's epic rally in January forced by retail traders. 
Even if the market has a correction, investors told Insider previously that the horde of retail traders who have joined the stock market amid the pandemic are largely here to stay, though meme stocks could be hit hard.

11 PlayStation exclusive games that make the PS5 worth buying,https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/ps5-exclusives-sony-games,"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more

Sony's PlayStation 5 is the fastest-selling video game console on the market, enticing millions of gamers to upgrade their machines for the next-generation of blockbuster releases. PlayStation's large library of exclusive games play a major role in the brand's lasting popularity, with hits like ""The Last of Us,"" ""God of War,"" and ""Marvel's Spider-Man"" breaking sales records and earning game of the year honors.
Sony says it's working on at least 25 upcoming PS5 exclusives, many of which will also work on PS4. That's good news, since the high demand for the PS5 is expected to outmatch supply for most of 2021. Players who grab games like ""Horizon Forbidden West"" on PS4 will be able to play an even better version for free whenever they upgrade to PS5.
Just a handful of PS5 games, like ""Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart"" and ""Demon's Souls,"" are unavailable on the PS4 due to their technical demands.
Below we've compiled a list of upcoming games you need a PlayStation console to play, excluding games that are also available on PC or Xbox consoles. 
""Ratchet and Clank"" has been a PlayStation exclusive series since 2002, and ""Rift Apart"" is the first new entry since 2016, when the series was rebooted and adapted into a movie.
Ratchet and his robotic sidekick Clank have invented a wide range of weapons and gadgets to battle the evil Dr. Nefarious and his cronies. In ""Rift Apart"" Ratchet travels through space and time to stop Nefarious from tearing the universe apart, using a mix of platforming and run-and-gun skills to progress through each new world. 
As a true PlayStation 5 exclusive, ""Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart"" makes use of the PS5's speedy loading times to let Ratchet quickly slide between worlds, and will incorporate ray tracing for enhanced reflections and lighting. The game also adds a new playable character to the series named Rivet, who hails from another dimension.
The original ""Final Fantasy VII"" was one of the first major exclusives released on the PS1, and more than 20 years later ""Final Fantasy VII Remake"" has returned to PS4 and PS5 as an exclusive reimagining of the classic game.
""Final Fantasy VII Remake"" has been design from the ground up with a new combat system and some of the most impressive graphics we've seen to date. However, ""Remake"" only contains about one third of the original ""Final Fantasy VII"" story, so sequels are on the way.
Released on June 10, ""Final Fantasy VII Remake: Intergrade"" is the first story add-on for the game and it's exclusive to PlayStation 5.  That same day, ""Final Fantasy VII Remake"" also received an update to improve performance on PS5 and add a camera mode to all versions of the game.
""Horizon Zero Dawn"" marked the debut of a new PlayStation franchise on PS4, pushing the boundaries of the console with its impressive visuals. Its sequel, ""Horizon Forbidden West,"" continues the open world adventure series on a new continent, with players once again assuming control over the huntress Aloy in a post-apocalyptic version of the western United States, including regions of San Francisco, Utah, and the Yosemite Valley.
The creators of ""Horizon Forbidden West,"" Guerilla Games, say the haptic feedback of the PS5 controller will let players feel the resistance of Aloy's bow while aiming, and it will have special interactions when fighting against machines and humans.
Sony has confirmed that ""Horizon Forbidden West"" will be available on PlayStation 4, as well as PS5.
The 2018 reboot of ""God of War"" was one of the PlayStation 4's most critically acclaimed titles, earning multiple ""Game of the Year"" awards with its polished gameplay and story presentation. Sony teased the game's sequel during a PlayStation 5 event in September 2020 with a logo and the word ""Ragnarok.""
Sony's Santa Monica Studios said it's aiming for a 2022 release for the ""God of War"" sequel, but hopefully we see a trailer before the end of the year.
""Gran Turismo"" is Sony's seminal racing franchise, with each new entry in the series pushing the limits of the PlayStation hardware. Sony has confirmed that ""Gran Turismo 7"" will incorporate ray-tracing visual effects, 3D audio, and haptic feedback using the PS5's Dual Sense controller.
A release window for ""Gran Turismo 7"" hasn't been announced yet.
""Returnal"" is one of the few PlayStation games that actually requires a PlayStation 5 to play, thanks to its fast moving gameplay and mutating environments. Players control an astronaut stranded on an alien planet who realizes that each time she dies, she is reborn at the start of her journey.
The goal of ""Returnal"" is to fight your way across this alien world and free yourself from the planet's cycle of life and death, but each death will reset your progress. That makes ""Returnal"" quite difficult to complete, but it's an absolute treat if you enjoy challenging games.
""Returnal"" also offers one of the most impressive demonstrations of the PS5 hardware so far, making expert use of the DualSense controller's adaptive triggers and haptic feedback alongside the console's next-gen processing power.
""Destruction AllStars"" is a vehicle combat game that pits players against each other in a vicious demolition derby. While the emphasis is on your car, drivers can hop out of their vehicle to avoid elimination and regain the upper hand by hopping in another car on the course.
Longtime PlayStation fans will remember ""Twisted Metal,"" a PlayStation-exclusive vehicle combat game that launched two months after the original PlayStation in 1995. ""Destruction AllStars"" may not have the same kind of dark humor, but PlayStation has a long history with the vehicle combat genre.
FromSoftware's ""Dark Souls"" games have earned a legendary reputation among hardcore gamers for their difficulty, but the series' origin actually dates back to a small PlayStation 3 exclusive called ""Demon's Souls"" released in 2009.
Despite its heavy influence on recent action games, ""Demon's Souls"" was never been released outside of the PS3, while ""Dark Souls I"" and ""Dark Souls II"" enjoyed remasters on newer consoles.
The dungeon crawling gameplay and haunting visuals of ""Demon's Souls"" were remastered for the PlayStation 5, with developer Bluepoint Games rebuilding all of FromSoftware's original game from the ground up with new character designs and stunning environments in 4K resolution.
""Marvel's Spider-Man"" was one of Sony's biggest PlayStation 4 exclusives, making the game's sequel an excellent way to demonstrate the difference in power between the PS4 and the PlayStation 5.
""Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales"" once again takes place in New York City, one year after the events of the first game. Marvel fans will recognize Miles from the 2018 film ""Into the Spider-Verse"" and years' worth of comic book appearances. His unique spider powers — an invisibility cloak and electric venom blasts — look even more impressive with the PS5's ray tracing features.
While ""Miles Morales"" is playable on PS4, the vast improvements in visuals and loading times make it one of most impressive games designed for PS5. If you haven't played the original ""Marvel's Spider-Man,"" you can also get the remastered version for PS5 when you buy the $70 Ultimate Edition of ""Miles Morales.""
Sackboy, the mascot of Sony's ""LittleBigPlanet"" series, got his very own game when the PS5 launched. Unlike ""LittleBigPlanet,"" which primarily focused on creating your own 2D platforming stages, ""Sackboy: A Big Adventure"" offers a full 3D range of motion and a set of premade levels for up to four players.
""Sackboy: A Big Adventure"" is available for PlayStation 4 too, though the PS5 enjoys faster load times and enhanced graphics. The difference between PS4 and PS5 isn't quite as noticeable as it is for games like ""Spider-Man: Miles Morales"" though.
""Astro's Playroom"" is a sequel to ""Astro Bot Rescue Mission,"" a virtual reality platforming game released for the PlayStation 4 in 2018. However, ""Playroom"" doesn't require a PlayStation VR headset, and comes pre-installed on the PS5 for free.
""Astro's Playroom"" is designed to show players how to use the special features of the PlayStation 5's DualSense controller as they guide Astro across four different worlds. Players can discover hidden artifacts from past PlayStation consoles and build a gallery of Sony's gaming history.

"Investing strategy: Hedge fund veterans talk meme stocks, volatility: Emles",https://www.businessinsider.com/investing-strategy-hedge-funds-meme-stock-outlook-retail-etf-emles-2021-6,"Sat, 19 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Fellow Goldman Sachs alums Gabriel Hammond and Nathan Miller are constantly on the lookout for uncorrelated sources of return from their investments.
The pair, who have spent two decades working in fund management, went their separate ways after a spell at the investment bank and teamed up again at New York-based asset manager Emles Advisors, which Hammond co-founded.
Hammond, who founded energy-focused firms Alerian Capital Management and SteelPath MLP, had been looking for ways to get the kind of results that high market volatility brings but without the huge risk. 
He spotted an opportunity with his long-term friend, mentor and former colleague, Miller, a contrarian value investor that had spent the past 20 years running classic long/short strategies at various hedge funds, including SAC Capital and Citadel.  
What caught Hammond's attention was Miller's calling of the COVID-19 market collapse at the start of 2020.
""I mean he absolutely made a killing positioning himself correctly in late February, early March of last year and before anybody was talking about it,"" Hammond said. ""Again, his engineering background really lends itself to the type of diligence and those special situations and that was really eye opening."" 
Hammond had to find a way to work with Miller based on his track record of performance following this strategy for years.
For the last ten years, Hammond has achieved annual returns of 50% within his personal accounts, according to documents seen by Insider. 
Together, they launched the Emles Alpha Opportunities ETF, a hedge-fund style active ETF with a long/short strategy that can be marketed to both retail and institutional investors.
Insider spoke to the pair about their approach to investing and their take on the meme-stock frenzy that has taken the world of trading by storm. 
""If we can get an event or a catalyst and combine it with something that's really, really cheap, that's a powerful way to compound money,"" Miller said.
Miller is looking for stocks with a one-to-three risk-reward profile and is exclusively focused on outliers that are dramatically overvalued or undervalued relative to their intrinsic value.
""We're focused on putting up very high returns,"" Miller said. ""That's why we call it a hedge fund-like product.""
The strategy they use for their ETF is one of active management that deploys hedge-fund style strategies, such as shorting index, or single-stock options, but without the focus on the leverage.
""We're totally unwilling to take the unsafe levels of leverage and margin that most hedge funds employ,"" Miller said. ""We know the inherent dangers, we don't think it's well understood by bulge bracket investment banks, you look at the number of funds that got destroyed on the Archegos unwind. That's a very clear example of how leverage is catastrophic.""
Miller believes in the reversion to the mean and has the goal to produce alpha in both the bear and bull markets.
""We like to buy stocks when they're cheap,"" Miller said. ""Companies and sectors can go through periods where they're over earning, or frankly, sentiment is just too high and so you see that today, there are bubbles, in our opinion, all over the place."" 
One very obvious example of a bubble is the meme-stock frenzy in which traders have pumped up the share prices of companies like video-game retailer GameStop, movie theater chain AMC, the makers of now-almost defunct mobile devices like BlackBerry or Nokia, and cryptocurrencies on social media.
Much of their efforts have centered on stock of companies that big hedge funds had sold short, or bet against, rather than on those firms' business models.
""It's disturbing for a fundamental investor to look at stocks that are untethered to fundamentals,"" Miller said.
As a contrarian, Miller is paid to be skeptical. He's currently cautious on disruptive, innovative thematic funds that are buying growth names but are agnostic to valuation. That's very dangerous, he said.
""I think we know how the movie ends,"" Miller said. ""I may not know every chapter in the book, I would be very cautious on the meme stocks, and stocks in general that are unrelated to fundamentals.""
Hedge funds over the years have faced increasing scrutiny over high fee structures and excessively risky strategies without delivering on their promises of outperformance.
Hammond points out how the recent short squeezes have helped highlight flaws in the existing hedge fund business model.
""I'd say that one of the hardest skills in all of investing is the short side and I think that's part of the big misnomer with hedge funds,"" Hammond said.
Funds take on tremendous amounts of risk on behalf of clients with a fantastic asymmetric risk reward for the manager.
""It's heads, you get 20% of a very large number,"" Hammond said, describing the manager's approach. ""Tails, it blows up and you don't lose anything, so the economic incentive structure doesn't appropriately incentivize people and obviously, that's why you've seen these [outflows].""

Hedge Fund D1 Capital's 2021 private investments,https://www.businessinsider.com/d1-capital-private-investments-dan-sundheim-venture-spacs-2021,"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Business Insider,"Hedge fund D1 Capital Partners, run by billionaire Dan Sundheim, is continuing to ramp up its private market bets — having invested in at least 35 private companies in 2021 so far. 
The $21 billion hedge fund has been making private investments in startups since its launch in 2018. Popular among fellow Tiger Cub firms Tiger Global and Coatue Management, private investing continues to take the hedge fund world by storm this year. 
As companies choose to stay private for longer periods of time and the number of public companies in the market has declined, hedge funds are turning to startups as a source of differentiated returns. They have won deals against traditional venture firms by offering startups lucrative 50% to 100% premiums, according to private markets data provider Pitchbook. 
D1, like many other hedge funds, made headlines in January for its losses in the public markets when popular short bets like Gamestop and AMC were pummeled by a mob of day traders. However, D1 was relatively insulated from this downside because, as Insider reported in October 2020, almost one-third of its capital is invested in private market bets, some of which have produced substantial profits.
One of its initial investments, a $160 million bet on cold-storage firm Lineage Logistics, appreciated over 150% during the pandemic. The fund has also invested in widely recognized names such as popular trading app Robinhood, Elon Musk's rocket company SpaceX, and salad unicorn Sweetgreen.
D1 powered full speed ahead in 2021 and we outlined each of the hedge fund's publically-announced investments below by sector with data provided by Pitchbook. Its investments this year so far have coalesced around logistics, enterprise software, e-commerce, consumer tech, healthcare, and fintech.
A spokesperson for D1 declined to comment on the firm's strategy or sectors of interest.

"45% of teens think they know more about crypto than their parents — and social media got them hooked, study finds",https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/crypto-investing-social-media-teens-wells-fargo-study-2021-6-1030496990,"Sat, 05 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Markets Insider,"Teenagers have a reputation for firmly believing they know way more than their parents. In the case of cryptocurrencies, almost half of them say they know more about these digital assets than Mom and Dad, and any interest they have in finance has been thanks to social media, a Wells Fargo survey published earlier this week found. 
Traditionally, parents have usually passed on financial knowledge and expertise about money and investing to their children. The survey showed almost two out of three kids, or 57%  of those polled, still agree this is the case, although this dynamic is shifting when it comes to cryptocurrency. 
The Wells Fargo Parent-Teen Study on investing included 318 teens between the ages of 13 and 17, and 304 parents of teens who are 13 to 17.
The survey showed 50% of parents said their teen knew more about bitcoin than they did, while a similar percentage - 45% - of teenagers felt their knowledge of crypto topped that of their parents. The survey also found teen boys were more likely to say they know more than their parents about bitcoin than girls. 58% of boys polled said this was the case, while only 33% of girls surveyed agreed, Wells Fargo said.
In some cases this has even led to parents taking investment advice from their children - 19 year old Adam Mlamali, who has invested in stocks and has crypto holdings, for example regularly gives his mother financial advice - including telling her when to sell her bitcoin. 
He believes that his mom seeing him take risks and reap profits as a result made her want to get involved, he told Insider. ""She likes it when I explain my analysis to her and will then consider if she would like to invest and how much."" Adam told Insider.  
Cryptocurrencies are especially popular topics on social media - where 35% of teens say they get at least some of their financial education. Parents seem to be unaware of this - only 12% said their children learnt about finance online in the Wells Fargo study. 
TikToks that are tagged with #bitcoin have 3.6 billion views on the social media platform and #crypto renders 3.4 billion views. On a broader scale, #fintok, which is the financial niche on TikTok, boasts 357.3 million clicks and #stocktok, where TikTokers talk about their top stock picks and investments, has 1.2 billion hits. 
So-called 'finfluencers', many of whom have over 100,000 followers, use social media platforms like TikTok to talk about their own investment strategies and journeys, share their top stock picks and provide financial education. Video titles range from ""3 stocks that will double in 2021"" over ""How to turn $100 into $7,000 in crypto"" to ""3 steps to start investing"" and ""Taking out $ from a Roth IRA"". Not all 'finfluencers' are qualified financial professionals or have formal investment education. 
Social media's power to move markets also appears interesting to teens - 45% of those surveyed said the social media led GameStop saga that caused chaos on markets earlier in the year got them hooked on finance. 
Reddit's WallStreetBets page, where much of the GameStop short squeeze began, has over 10 million members. It also played a major role in the accelerate growth of dogecoin and is currently driving the AMC Entertainment craze - retail traders had organised themselves online, investing in the company's stock and skyrocketing it's stock price. 
""Social media has a profound influence on our younger generations. Those generations grew up with social media and often trust many of the platforms more than their parents do,"" Mariana Martinez, a family dynamics consultant with Wells Fargo's Wealth & Investment Management group, said.
