The Federal Trade Commission said Thursday it has settled with mobile advertising company Tapjoy over claims it used false advertising offers for the promise of in-game rewards that weren't given. 
But regulators also said Apple and Google helped create the environment that squeezes mobile gaming industry players and incentivizes them to find other monetization models that may have unsavory consequences for consumers.
Tapjoy runs a platform that lets users complete activities, like signing up for a free trial or downloading and running an app, in exchange for in-game virtual currency. It earns commissions from third-party advertisers who want to entice users to perform these tasks. 
The FTC said in a statement that hundreds of thousands consumers complained they had never received promised awards. Some spent ""significant [amounts] of money completing various Tapjoy offers"" or revealed sensitive information like medical history or contact information.
Democratic Commissioners Rohit Chopra and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said in a statement they sought to address the conduct of Tapjoy against the backdrop of massive growth of the mobile gaming market.  
""It appears that Tapjoy amplified false offers by its business partners, who baited gamers with big rewards only to cheat them when it was time to pay up,"" they wrote. ""Tapjoy did little to clean up the mess, even when hundreds of thousands of gamers filed complaints. This also harmed developers of mobile games, who were cheated of advertising revenue they were entitled to.""
But the commissioners widened their criticism in their statement, saying Tapjoy was ""a minnow next to the gatekeeping giants of the mobile gaming industry, Apple and Google."" 
""By controlling the dominant app stores, these firms enjoy vast power to impose taxes and regulations on the mobile gaming industry, which was generating nearly $70 billion annually even before the pandemic,"" they said. 
The commissioners added that those ""gatekeepers"" can harm developers and innovation, and that under ""heavy taxation"" from those major players, developers have been pushed to ""alternative monetization models that rely on surveillance, manipulation, and other harmful practices."" 
Both Apple and Google charge up to 30% for sales through their platforms, with a few exceptions. 
""By offering a platform connecting advertisers, gamers, and game developers, Tapjoy allows these developers to generate advertising revenue that Apple and Google do not tax,"" the statement reads. ""But this monetization model also creates opportunities for fraud…""  
Both companies have faced legal action over their mobile app store fees, which outspoken developers have complained are exorbitant. One such developer is Epic Games, which filed suit against both companies, claiming they engage in anticompetitive practices. Apple filed a countersuit. Google also faces separate antitrust suits from the Justice Department and several coalitions of states. 
Apple pointed to CEO Tim Cook's congressional testimony last year, where he said, ""for the vast majority of apps on the App Store, developers keep 100 percent of the money they make. The only apps that are subject to a commission are those where the developer acquires a customer on an Apple device and where the features or services would be experienced and consumed on an Apple device.""
 Google declined to comment.
The proposed settlement bans Tapjoy from misrepresenting the rewards and terms it offers, and must also monitor its advertisers to ensure they're following through on promised rewards. The FTC said when it issues a consent order on a final basis, it carries the force of law for future actions, and said each violation of such orders can result in penalties of up to $43,280.  
In a statement, Tapjoy's CEO Jeff Drobick said the FTC had raised concerns about its reward delivery back in 2017. 
""Over the past 3 years, we have enhanced the rewarding process and customer interaction, and worked to reach a resolution that we believe benefits consumers, Tapjoy's partners, and our business overall,"" he said in an emailed statement. ""In accordance with our agreement with the FTC, we will further increase our efforts with advertisers to improve the clarity and transparency of their offers, and we will add enhancements to our offer testing and reward monitoring processes.""
The commission voted 5-0 in favor of the settlement with Tapjoy, but the statement targeting Apple and Google included only the Democratic commissioners' names. Those commissioners will soon have more sway in the agency when a third Democrat is confirmed to the panel. 
It's unclear when exactly that would happen, though it's common for FTC chairs to vacate their posts around presidential transitions. While a new chair or commissioner (if one of the current Democrats is elevated to the chairmanship) will need to be confirmed by the Senate, that process may be smoother than initially expected as Democrats are projected to secure a slim majority in the chamber.

In this article
Apple senior executives are measured on key financial goals when it comes to being awarded among the  market's most lucrative pay packages, such as sales, earnings and valuation growth. Now, for the first time, executives at the stock market's largest company are also going to have a portion of their millions in cash bonus pay linked directly to factors reflecting a fast-changing world of capitalism: environmental, social and governance (ESG) metrics.
In 2021, Apple is adding an ESG ""bonus modifier"" to its cash incentive program which can swing the total bonus payout by 10% — executing on ESG goals can increase the bonus by 10%, while failing to hit ESG targets could cost Apple's top brass a bonus reduction of the same amount.
The new executive compensation measure revealed in Apple's recent 2021 proxy — shareholders have to approve executive compensation plans each year — comes after years of pressure from activist shareholders. In fact, just last year Apple opposed a proxy measure filed by shareholder Zevin Asset Management — which received 12% support from the company's stockholders — that asked for executive compensation to be linked to ESG. Apple argued to shareholders there was no need to narrowly link pay to ESG since its corporate mission already included ESG goals foundationally.
What changed in one year? A lot.
For starters, activist shareholders say it is common practice among corporations to resist any resolution introduced at annual meetings, even in cases where the companies are moving in a similar direction — if at a slower pace — and when they are ready will do an about-face.
""The general posture with companies toward proposals is oppose in every instance,"" said Pat Tomaino, director of socially responsible investing at Zevin Asset Management, which authored the ESG compensation proposal last year. The Apple shareholder said that this posture is even more likely to be the case when the issue is executive pay. ""Companies desire to have a free hand with executive compensation and we see it across the marketplace. The relationship between the compensation committee and the CEO is guarded very closely.""
To its credit, Tomaino said Apple reached out to him after his measure's defeat at the 2020 meeting and provided him with an indication that change was coming. He said throughout the process Apple was eager to understand what the shareholder was asking. ""I don't think of shareholder resolutions as adversarial. They wanted to understand what we wanted and i never doubted they were going in good faith to compensation consultants to study and understand whether it made sense. They could have chosen to do nothing."" 
The past year was no ordinary year either.
After a 2020 that included civil unrest in the U.S., the Black Lives matter movement, and a pandemic that showed the financial fragility and health risks across many communities and workers, there is more pressure on companies to focus on ESG themes, such as diversity, equity and inclusion, and labor policy. ""For better or worse, this year the world is a lot different than it was last proxy season,"" said Jannice Koors, senior managing director at Pearl Meyer, an executive compensation consultant. ""Diversity, equity and inclusion is taking up a lot more bandwidth in boardrooms."" 
Apple declined to comment to CNBC beyond citing the proxy language.
""It will enter into the discussion more,"" said Courtney Yu, head of research for executive compensation consulting firm Equilar. ""What happened over the course of the past year and summer has helped supercharge lots of these processes and put direct focus on how companies are looking at diversity ... and just their contribution to society in general.""
An analysis by JUST Capital, which ranks corporations on ESG (Apple is No. 3 overall, behind tech peers Microsoft and Nvidia), found that in recent years among the Russell 1000 universe of companies about 20% have linked executive pay to ESG goals. That is consistent with other surveys showing between 10% and 20% of companies have some executive pay tied to ESG key performance indicators. Most are of the magnitude of the new Apple 10% swing factor in bonus pay, according to a Pearl Meyer survey from last summer. Roughly 25% of the firms that said they have an ESG pay component indicated it was less than 5%; 67% indicated it was 5% to 10%.
Executive compensation and ESG experts say the data on companies that have incorporated ESG into pay can be misleading, though, and overstate the trend's influence when the details are not considered. A significant percentage of the existing ESG compensation plans are in industries where they have been mandated for a long time due to safety concerns, such as in oil drilling, mining and other industrial operations where the risk of an accident is an immediate material and legal risk to the company.
Or as Koors put it, ""Old ESG versus emerging ESG. Emerging ESG is different.""
If 15% of S&P 500 companies have incentive plans with an ESG component, that includes many with the ""old"" ESG, according to Gregg Passin, senior partner and Mercer's U.S. executive solutions Leader. ""It will be much bigger this year and in future years,"" he said. A small number of companies included diversity, equity and inclusion as a metric in prior years. ""We expect many more this year,"" he added.
The majority of companies that have an ESG pay metric use a bonus modifier like Apple. It allows companies to still rely on core financial metrics, such as sales and profit, as the most influential payout measures, while bringing in newer metrics — which also may be harder to measure — on the edges.
""Is it enough? Ten percent of a bonus doesn't strike me as being a massive swing factor,"" said Martin Whittaker, CEO of JUST Capital.
Apple's top executives received bonuses in 2020 that were 179% of the target payout opportunity, according to its proxy.
""It's laudable it is in there at all, and it puts Apple in a minority. That's leadership. ... If we only have 20% of companies tying compensation to ESG, that tells you there is lots of room for intelligent incentive packages that will drive performance even better,"" Whittaker said.
Using a modifier takes the pressure off in the goal-setting process and reflects the imprecision that still exists in ESG. ""Companies can't just dive into the deep end of the pool right off the bat,"" Koors said (her firm does not work with Apple specifically). ""The question for them is, 'How do we start to introduce these measures in a way where we don't end up regretting it. You don't necessarily want to be the first one out. You can tell the pioneers by the ones that have arrows in their backs. But lots want to be a fast follower.""
Pearl Meyer expects more companies will be adopting ESG metrics in incentive plans — in its summer survey the number of companies that said they were looking at adding an ESG pay metric this year (9%) more than doubled over those that said they already had one (6%). ""Given the data we've seen, this is still the early adopter phase,"" Koors said.
Which ESG metrics, and how many, to incorporate, remains a challenging question. ""That everything is important should be signalled, but on the flip side, if everything is important than nothing is important,"" Koors said.
Mercer's Passin recommends no more than a handful of executive compensation metrics in total, and only one or two tied to ESG, though companies can have multiple factors considered within each category.
""What are we measuring? That's the bigger problem,"" says Whittaker.
Climate is an area in which metrics are maturing, such as reductions in carbon emissions across multiple well-defined scopes of emissions types. But not all ESG metrics are as easy to define. ""The issue is there has been no generally accepted standard set of ESG metrics,"" Whittaker said.
In the Equilar 500, roughly 20% of the companies tie compensation to some kind of diversity metric, ""and even there, it is very broad,"" Yu said.
There are quantitative measurements for gender pay gap or ethnic pay gap analysis, but there is no ""monolithic approach,"" says Koors.
The issues should not deter companies from thinking about senior executive incentive plans, though, because they drive behavior and performance throughout an organization. ""You need everyone in the boat all rowing in the same direction and the more companies that make a plan like this, it can cascade down through the entire management."" 
""It's typically the first step companies take, the bonus modifier,"" Tomaino said. ""Companies typically do not reorient a whole portion of equity incentive around ESG, but take an existing part of the cash bonus plan.""
Even in taking its first step, Tomaino said Apple has done more than other companies that insert basic language into a proxy saying it is at the discretion of the company's compensation committee to set targets for pay, and that could include ESG performance.
Apple's move is better than a blanket statement, but ""it gives them a ton of wiggle room,"" Whittaker said. ""Sometimes getting started is the hardest thing. We expect to see a lot more shareholder pressure on executive compensation.""
More shareholder measures are coming soon, and targeting Apple peers among the market's dominant tech firms. Tomaino said Zevin Asset Management will again introduce a measure at Alphabet for this year's meeting.
""Impact investors can now point to Apple and I think it is a powerful example,"" Tomaino said. ""Our argument is there is no better way to send a signal that it is mission critical than putting a portion of executive compensation at risk. I wouldn't say Apple went from zero to 60. Apple went from zero to 30.""
Microsoft, Intel and IBM already have a compensation plan in place that accomplishes something similar to Apple's new incentive.
An Alphabet spokeswoman told CNBC in an email that in ""assessing the individual performance of our executive officers, the Leadership Development and Compensation Committee considers their performance against a number of strategic goals, including those related to sustainability and diversity."" 
Tomaino described Alphabet's approach to similar resolutions introduced over the past three years as ""less transparent"" than Apple.
""It is harder to tell if they are considering a change and their contention to us is that within each executive performance review there are certain basic sustainability issues on the table. Our contention is we want ESG aimed at senior officers and need more on what the mechanism is. And we have not been able to understand it over the past three years,"" Tomaino said.
For Apple, the proof that the ESG metric matters won't come until next year. That is because companies do not actually detail their compensation awards and how they arrived at those awards until the following year's proxy.
""We have to wait and see how serious they are about using this tool now that they have it,"" Tomaino said.
Investors will be looking at the discussion in next year's compensation section of the Apple proxy and how executive payouts moved up or down in respect to ESG. ""That's what we get with any other financial and we are already pushing on Apple to outline what investors would want to see.""
""No one telegraphs this in advance,"" Koors said.
Apple has increased transparency on climate and raw materials relative to conservation, and investors want to see that metric-approach in supply chain risks and with diversity and inclusion. As examples, that can include recruiting at historically Black colleges and universities, and employee participation in affinity groups.
""The labor issues in their supply chain are a big issue, as is progress on diversity in engineering,"" Tomaino said. ""Tim Cook has described these issues as mission critical and ESG is financially relevant right now and into the long term. It is time for Apple to put their money where their mouth is ... a warts and all analysis. My message is consistent to companies: as an investor I don't want to substitute my judgment for their own or micromanage. They tell me which are the most relevant factors for them and how to get there.""
Companies should be less concerned about looking bad and more focused on how to improve, but that worry is in the air.
""What does scare companies is having to report on it, if it is metric you have to disclose and talk about how you did next year,"" Passin said. ""It takes the brave company to be serious about this and put it in, in a real way.""
But Passin does think we will start seeing purpose-driven compensation more tied to a multi-stakeholder view of a corporation. 
Moving ESG into long-term incentive plans rather than just the annual cash bonus ultimately is appropriate, he said, and it is a conversation that Mercer is starting to have with clients. ""But it is not going to be fast,"" Passin said. ""Holding executives accountable, just like with EPS and revenue, you need to be able to measure it. Metrics are not magic. You need a strategy on how to achieve it and how to build facts and end goals. Many companies are not ready yet.""
Some critics of executive compensation are focused on the disparity between CEO pay and median worker income — Apple CEO Tim Cook makes 256 times the median Apple employee pay of roughly $58,000. And they say as long as CEOs are paid enormous sums, factoring ESG into that pay does not solve the larger problem. But Tomaino and other ESG experts said while wage disparity is among the bigger ESG issues, shareholders shouldn't view it as overriding the broader ESG-linked compensation discussion.
""It is the most profitable company in the world and the simple reality is high-pay decision makers should not be sheltered, isolated and unaccountable from what happens on the ground,"" Tomaino said. ""CEO to worker median pay ratio is one metric of how divorced a leader is from what's happening on the ground, but it doesn't tell the whole story. At Apple, imagine the gap between Tim Cook and not just the Apple software engineer but those who shuffle in and out of supply chain factories.""
""If the company proves that the goals they set were rigorous such that the 10% modifier plus or minus doesn't always end up being positive, if we see examples where they set goals and they were not layups and money was taken away, then give them credit for it,"" Koors said. 
Apple's example will draw this into more peer conversations, but it may not see quick traction across the broader market given that so many companies are dealing with financial pressures caused by Covid-19. ""The lingering effects which aren't going away any time soon may keep executives focused on financials,"" Equilar's Yu said. ""Time will tell how impactful it is but any time a big name like Apple is saying that they are going to put more of a focus on ESG it can make some waves.""

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg used the opening remarks of the company's fourth quarter earnings call to blast Apple over its upcoming privacy changes, and to say Facebook increasingly sees Apple as one of its biggest competitors.
Apple is gearing up for a software change that will more prominently ask iPhone and iPad users if they want to share their information for ad-tracking purposes. The online advertising industry expects to be hit as some percentage of users choose not to share that information. 
Facebook, which derives nearly all its revenue from online advertising, has been outspoken about the changes, running newspaper ads, publishing a website and running a blog post outlining its arguments opposing Apple over the change it claims ""threatens the personalized ads that millions of small businesses rely on to find and reach customers."" 
Zuckerberg, in his comments, suggested Apple uses its position to help its own services, particularly its iMessage service, which competes with Facebook's Messenger and WhatsApp services.
""iMessage is a key linchpin of their ecosystem,"" he said. ""It comes pre-installed on every iPhone and they preference it with private APIs and permissions, which is why iMessage is the most used messaging service in the U.S.""
He said Apple's business is now depending more and more on gaining share in apps and services.
""Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,"" he said. ""This impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes.""
Zuckerberg also reiterated Facebook's argument that Apple's privacy changes will make it harder for small businesses ability to reach their customers with targeted ads.
""Apple may say they're doing this to help people but the moves clearly track their competitor interests,"" he said. ""We and others are going to be up against this for the foreseeable future.""

GUANGZHOU, China — Apple raked in its highest ever revenue in the greater China region in the December quarter as a record number of iPhone upgrades helped the U.S. tech giant in one of its most important markets.
Greater China revenue came in at $21.31 billion in the three months ended December 26, up 57% from last year. That was the highest revenue figure for a single quarter in greater China in Apple's history. Apple also recorded its highest ever quarter for total revenue as it reported fiscal first-quarter earnings on Wednesday.
Apple CEO Tim Cook said the performance in China was ""more than an iPhone story,"" with other products contributing, but noted the company's flagship smartphone was crucial.
""China also had a record number of upgraders during the quarter, the most we've ever seen in a quarter. I think probably some portion of this was that people probably delayed purchasing in the previous quarter as rumors started appearing about an iPhone,"" Cook said on the earnings call.
""Keep in mind that 5G in China is, the network is well established. And the overwhelming majority of phones being sold are 5G phones. And so I think there was some level of anticipation for us delivering an iPhone with 5G.""
Apple released the iPhone 12 series in October and Chinese users snapped up pre-orders for the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro in particular. Apple also released two other models — the iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max.
The iPhone 12 range can connect to next-generation 5G mobile networks which are rolling out fast in China. Apple's competitors already had 5G phones on the market.
The momentum seen in pre-orders appears to have stuck through the December quarter. In October and November, Apple shipped 11.2 million iPhones in China, according to data provided to CNBC by IDC. The final figures for December have not yet been calculated. IDC tracks so-called sell-in numbers which are iPhones Apple ships to distributors in China.
Separate figures from Shanghai-based CINNO Research estimate Apple actually sold 13.57 million iPhones in the October to December period, which would mark the highest single quarter of iPhone sales in China in history.
Apple shipped 90.1 million iPhones in the fourth quarter of 2020 globally, the largest number ever shipped by any vendor in the history of the smartphones in a single quarter, IDC said. Apple no longer provides iPhone unit sales data.
Will Wong, an analyst at IDC, said two key factors were behind Apple's success in China — attractive iPhone 12 models and the weakness of Chinese smartphone giant Huawei.
The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro were the most-bought models due to good pricing and features such as screen size, according to Wong.
Meanwhile, Huawei has been hurt by a number of U.S. sanctions that have effectively cut it off from key components like cutting-edge chips, which has opened the door for Apple to take some of its market share.
In China, Huawei and Apple are seen as high-end smartphone players, according to Wong. Huawei has been slowing down supplies of its smartphones to distributors and retailers to make them last longer, Wong said. As a result, these distributors see reduced competition from Huawei.
""The channel partners see the competition to Apple is lesser now and consumers are also likely to shift from Huawei to Apple in China,"" Wong said. That has helped Apple increase shipments of its iPhone in China.
Cook also said that Apple's other products sold well in China.
""We could not have turned in a performance like we did with only iPhone,"" the CEO said.
""iPad did extremely well, far beyond the Company average. Mac was about the Company average. Wearables, Home and Accessories was above the Company average. And so if you really look at it, we did really well across the board there.""
Services revenue, which includes money made from the App Store and other products like cloud storage, has become an important part of the Apple story for investors.
In the first few months of each year, Apple usually gets a boost from China because of increased spending by users around Lunar New Year. But in 2020, China went into lockdown in response to the coronavirus outbreak for much of February and March. Now, China generally has the virus under control and in many parts of the country, life is back to normal.
On the earnings call, one analyst asked if the ""seasonal bump"" may not happen in 2021 due to the prolonged amount of time people spent at home in the previous year.
Luca Maestri, chief financial officer at Apple, said that during the lockdown in China the ""propensity for playing games continued for several weeks, more than a typical cycle.""
He said that Apple expects ""to have a great (March) quarter in China"" but warned the comparison ""is going to be particularly challenging because of what happened a year ago.""

Apple CEO Tim Cook on Thursday linked Facebook's business model, which used data to serve targeted ads, with real-world consequences like violence or reducing public trust in vaccines.
Cook's speech at a data privacy conference in Brussels did not mention Facebook by name, but the social media company was clearly a target of the Apple CEO's warning.
""If a business is built on misleading users, on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform,"" Cook said.
Cook also criticized recommendation algorithms that suggest extremist groups to users, as Facebook has been under fire for doing. On Wednesday, Facebook said it will no longer automatically recommend political groups.
Cook also said he believes that some companies reward content that could undermine public trust in vaccinations to boost engagement.
""At a moment of rampant disinformation and conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms, we can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement is good and the longer the better,"" Cook said.
The speech comes as the battle between the Silicon Valley rivals heats up, particularly about a new iPhone feature called App Tracking Transparency, which will force apps to ask for user permission to access an important device identifier that's used by companies like Facebook and Google to serve and measure mobile ads.
Cook's comments also come amid questions about whether Facebook's algorithms and tools were used to supercharge the pro-Trump riot on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg was already forced to defend the company, saying that rioters who were planning violence were ""largely"" not organized on Facebook.
""It is long past time to stop pretending that this approach doesn't cover the costs of polarization, of lost trust, of violence,"" Cook said. ""A social dilemma cannot be allowed to cause a social catastrophe.""
On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg slammed the App Tracking Transparency change, and said that Apple was its biggest competitor. He also implied that Apple is using privacy as a justification to disadvantage Facebook.
""Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,"" Zuckerberg said.
Apple told CNBC on Wednesday that the next beta version of its iPhone operating system will start to enforce app tracking, which means the change will go into effect for everyone soon — Apple says it will happen in ""early spring.""
Correction: An earlier version of this story misquoted a sentence of Tim Cook's speech. The correct quote is: ""It deserves reform.""

Apple's App Store customers spent a record $540 million on New Year's Day alone, marking a 40% increase from last year, the company said Wednesday in its annual services report.
On top of that, Apple announced it generated $1.8 billion in App Store sales of digital goods and services in the week between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve and now has 90 million monthly active users for its Apple Books app.
But the report didn't provide updates on subscribers for its suite of newer subscription products such as Apple TV+, its video streaming service; Apple Music and Apple Fitness+, which is a Peloton competitor. In the fall, Apple began bundling many of its subscription services together as part of its Apple One program. The services category is a key growth area Apple has focused on in recent years as hardware sales growth has fallen.
Apple's App Store update also comes as tensions continue to rise over Apple's control over its App Store policies. Several app developers, most notably Facebook and Fortnite maker Epic Games, have publicly criticized Apple for taking a 30% cut of App Store sales from developers and for enforcing a new policy designed to disclose which apps track your data for targeted advertising. Apple recently altered its policies to take a 15% cut from companies that generate less than $1 million in App Store sales, which the company said was a move to help small businesses.
Overall, Apple's services generated revenue of $53.8 billion in the company's last fiscal year, which ended in September 2021. Apple is expected to report its fiscal first-quarter earnings in a few weeks.

SINGAPORE — Shares of Hyundai Motor surged 19% after the South Korean automaker said it was in early-stage talks with Apple over potentially working together to develop an electric car.
""We understand that Apple is in discussion with a variety of global automakers, including Hyundai Motor. As the discussion is at its early stage, nothing has been decided,"" a representative from Hyundai Motor told CNBC's Chery Kang.
The statement followed a local report from the Korea Economic Daily that said Apple suggested the tie-up and Hyundai Motor was reviewing the terms. The report said both electric vehicle production as well as battery development were included in the proposal, and that the car could potentially be released in 2027.
Apple declined to comment on the report.
Hyundai later released an updated statement that avoided the mention of Apple and said, ""We've been receiving requests of potential cooperation from diverse companies regarding development of autonomous driving EVs, but no decisions have been made as discussions are in early stage.""
Shares of Hyundai Motor and its affiliates popped in South Korea.
Hyundai Motor rose 19.42%, Hyundai Wia added 21.33%, Hyundai Mobis gained 18.06% and Hyundai Glovis was up 0.75%. Shares of Hyundai affiliate Kia Motors, which is the second-largest automobile manufacturer in South Korea, surged 8.41%.
Speculation about an Apple car has been rife for several years but nothing concrete has materialized.
""Over the last six years we have seen many twists and turns in Apple's automotive ambitions,"" analysts Daniel Ives and Strecker Backe from Wedbush Securities, said in a note.
""Project Titan as its been known within the halls of Cupertino has ultimately been significantly scaled down from its initial ramp a few years ago and now appears to be front and center again on the radar screen of the Street,"" they said.
Citing sources familiar with the matter, Reuters last month reported that Apple was moving forward with its self-driving car technology. The report said the iPhone-maker was targeting to produce a passenger vehicle by 2024 that could include its own breakthrough battery technology.
While the report sent shares soaring for companies that build parts for autonomous cars, prominent Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the hype was purely on speculation that some of those companies may supply parts for the Apple car.
Kuo warned that the market was ""too bullish"" on the Apple car and said he wouldn't be surprised if the vehicle doesn't launch until 2028 or later.
While Apple's current business is based on selling premium computers, phones and accessories, cars are a different sector than Apple's traditional strength. While some Wall Street analysts see the automotive sector as a new market for Apple to grow into, others say the reality of making an Apple-branded car could potentially mean heavy investments for low margins.
Ives and Backe said they would assign a 35%-40% chance of Apple launching its own standalone car due to the ""Herculean-like auto production capabilities, battery technology ramp, financial model implications, and regulatory hurdles involved in such a game changing initiative.""
""In addition, on the autonomous front and given safety/regulatory issues we would see a longer timeframe if Apple ultimately heads down this path especially given the cautious DNA of Cook & Co. in launching new products,"" the Wedbush analysts said. They added that partnerships are ""likely the first step"" for Apple in this space.

The long-awaited privacy update to Apple's iPhone and iPad operating systems that could dramatically hurt mobile advertising is coming in ""early spring,"" Apple told CNBC on Wednesday.
To target mobile ads and measure how effective they are, app developers and other industry players currently often use Apple's (IDFA), or a string of letters and numbers that's different on every Apple device. But once this update rolls out, app makers will be forced to ask permission to access a user's IDFA through a prompt. A significant portion of users are expected to say no, reducing the effectiveness of targeted ads.
Apple first announced the change last summer, giving advertisers and app makers ample time to prepare. But it's become a major point of contention for ad-supported companies, who could lose revenue from the change.
Facebook in particular argues that the change will hurt the availability of free content on the open web and the ability of small business to place personalized ads. On Facebook's Q4 2020 earnings call Wednesday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg slammed the change, calling Apple one of its biggest competitors and claiming that the change ""threatens the personalized ads that millions of small businesses rely on to find and reach customers."" 
The timing of Apple's change has been the subject of intense speculation in the mobile industry. Apple CEO Tim Cook is set to speak Thursday about data privacy at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in Brussels. On Thursday, the company is also releasing new marketing materials, including an update to its website and a report on data usage to illustrate how companies track user data across websites and apps.
Apple told CNBC that the next beta version of iOS will require app developers to ask permission to access the phone's unique identifier.
The current version of iOS is 14.4, which was released earlier this week. There currently isn't a public beta version beyond that available to developers. Apple declined to provide additional timing details. 
As companies prepare for the change, they're letting partners and advertisers know how they plan to approach the change. Google on Wednesday said in a post that it will no longer use any information that falls under Apple's AppTrackingTransparency framework for its iOS apps, and doesn't plan to show the prompt on those apps.
Nominations are open for the 2021 CNBC Disruptor 50, a list of private start-ups using breakthrough technology to become the next generation of great public companies. Submit by Friday, Feb. 12, at 3 pm EST.

Big technology corporations including Apple, Alphabet's Google and Microsoft have raced to create a pair of fashionable smart glasses readily embraced by consumers, but 2021 is shaping up to be one more year these gadgets fall short of mass adoption.
With a launch of Facebook smart glasses as early as this summer, technology companies are getting one step closer, but widespread consumer interest is five to 10 years away, says Tuong Nguyen, a principal analyst at technology consulting firm Gartner. And some tech CEOS agree. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel speculated it would be at least 10 years before consumers widely adopt smart glasses speaking during the 2019 TechCrunch Disrupt conference in San Francisco.
A recent report from Gartner forecasts the wearable device market will see significant growth, but that includes not only smart glasses but watches and virtual reality headsets. Gadgets like the Apple Watch already have been big successes. Gartner forecasts wearables will reach $109 billion by 2024, with watches and virtual reality headsets for gaming growing by compounded annual growth rates of 20% and 22%, respectively. 
For smart glasses, the lag in mass market adoption is a result of slow progress on easy-to-use designs, fashionable appearances and easy-to-use content, Nguyen said. Many products remain bulky, making it a hard sell for consumers looking to stay fashionable on the go, while slow connectivity issues dissuade those looking for efficiency. Companies also have yet to work out powering kinks such as whether its tethered to a computer or battery-powered.
But the latest iterations of smart glasses are showing progress. Last week, Vuzix premiered a fashion-forward product at the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show expected to hit the market this summer and that will feature speakers, noise-canceling microphones and offer options supporting WiFi and data.
The Rochester-headquartered company, which has long created smart glasses products for enterprise clients, is making its first major foray into the consumer market. In 2015, Intel Corp. invested nearly $25 million for a 30% stake in the company.
Lenovo introduced its ThinkReality A3 smart glasses at CES, which tether to a PC and some Motorola devices. These smart glasses allow users to project several virtual screens at once and come with an added speaker and microphone for interacting with peers or coworkers.
There's also a range of everyday benefits to this product niche which continue to multiply as it develops. Smart glasses can be used for virtual shopping, figuring out what furniture fits into homes, and could one day replace screens entirely, said Rick Kowalski, director of industry analysis and business intelligence at the Consumer Technology Association.
For years, IKEA has toyed with using the Microsoft's HoloLens to allow customers to plan out a kitchen, bathroom or room redesign, while Lowe's implemented a pilot program in several stores in 2016. ""The value that they bring is so far beyond what they can think of right now,"" Kowalski said. 
Smart glasses initially hit the market as early as 2012, but most have relied on enterprise clients, with only a few temporarily targeting consumers. 
In 2013, Google released the first prototype of the Google Glass to a select group of consumers before going public in May 2014. Retailing at $1,500 a pair, the product fit few consumer price points and came under fire for potential privacy issues related to its connected camera; it's consumer model was discontinued in 2015, and the company found a place developing line for warehouse and manufacturing use.
The latest iteration geared toward the enterprise community was launched in 2019. Retailing at $999, the model comes equipped with voice activated applications can be managed from a mobile device.
Despite a slow integration into the consumer market, Covid-19 and the rise in remote work could accelerate smart glasses integration in health, medical and service fields. Vuzix recently announced they would partner with a medical technology company to assist with remote servicing during the pandemic.
Microsoft is also putting smart glasses to use in the defense sector. First available to consumers in 2019, the HoloLens glasses can overlay images and display computer programs. In 2019, the company won a $479 million contract to deploy 100,000 prototypes to the U.S. military hoping to improve soldier effectiveness, a move which came under harsh employee criticism.
The decision caused some concerns among employees who across the tech sectors have been more vocal in recent years as activists questioning some uses of their own technology. But Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella later defended the decision in an interview with CNN Business, citing that the company would not ""withhold technology from institutions that we have elected in democracies to protect the freedoms we enjoy.""
In 2016, Snap made its foray into the smart glasses market with Spectacles, a wearable product that allowed users to record videos to sync with their phones. But by 2017, several media outlets reported that the creator of Snapchat largely overestimated demand and less than half of buyers continued using the product within a month of purchase, internal company data obtained by Business Insider suggested. Though largely unsuccessful among consumers, the most recent iteration offers 3-D capabilities and retails for $380, a fraction of the price of its competitors.
The price point for most smart glasses is still high, with many models upwards of $2,500. The new Vuzix glasses are expected to retail for $1,000; Lenovo has not yet detailed pricing on its ThinkReality A3 smart glasses. Offering consumer-friendly pricing for the products is one way to accelerate the rollout, but companies also need to ensure smart glasses are accompanied by easy-to-use apps and libraries of content that keep consumers occupied.
Without these vast content libraries released in tandem with smart-glasses, consumers are less likely to materialize the benefits of the product, said Allan Cook, a managing partner at Deloitte leading the digital reality practice.
""People think it's weird to be wearing AR or smart glasses,"" he said. ""There's been blocks to the market in the past, but in 2021 we are going to see some dramatic increase.""
Some experts thought 2020 would be ""the year"" of headsets due to the pandemic but it wasn't, and again in 2021, while there will be growth it will be off a low base and more of it continuing in the enterprise market, according to a Deloitte analysis. Overall spending on AR and VR headsets, software, and services, including purchases by consumers, rose in 2020 to $12 billion globally, which was up 50% from 2019, but below the pre-pandemic forecast of almost 80% growth. With the pandemic accelerating the opportunity to demonstrate their value, digital reality headsets may continue to gain ground after the pandemic ends due to a variety of other benefits, such as lower cost, greater safety, and better learning retention, but those benefits still show more appeal to and adoption among enterprise clients rather than consumers, according to the Deloitte outlook.
As technology companies push for greater consumer adoption, several tech giants beyond Google and Microsoft have announced plans for their own smart glass creations expected to hit the market in the next few years.
Facebook plans to release its smart glasses created with Luxottica's Ray-Ban. The social media giant is banking on the popular sunglasses brand style-sense to offer a fashion-forward model that will appeal to skeptical customers. In 2019, CNBC also previously reported that the company was working on an accompanying artificial intelligence voice assistant to rival Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri.
""I can't go into full product details yet, but they're really the next step on the road to augmented reality glasses,"" said CEO Mark Zuckerberg during a September livestream from Facebook Connect, where the company annually showcases virtual reality products.
Simultaneously, the company is working on Project Aria, an initiative that will distribute devices to employees to accumulate video, audio and location data, and ultimately help the company research and develop its smart glasses. Facebook first announced its Luxottica partnership in 2019.
Apple is reportedly working on its own AR glasses that would allow users to view maps, text messages and control Siri, expected to hit the market by 2023 at the earliest. Development on the product is shrouded in secrecy — like all of Apple's R&D, which the company never provides comment on. An augmented and virtual reality headset similar to Facebook's Oculus Rift is also reportedly in the works.
Wall Street is anxious for an Apple unveil, with Wedbush analyst Dan Ives putting Apple Glasses on his 2021 wish list and making a prediction that the company's first augmented reality eyewear — the result of many years of development in the labs of Cupertino — will be introduced at the company's WWDC 2021 developers conference, expected to be held in June.
Amazon has not announced plans for a full-scale augmented reality competitor, but it currently offers the Echo Frames, a pair of glasses enhanced with a speaker and built-in Amazon voice assistant.  
Jio, an India-based technology company that's backed by both Google and Facebook, announced Jio Glass last year, a mixed reality headset that connects to the internet through a cable connected to a smartphone. Although the company, part of India's largest conglomerate Reliance Industries, has yet to announce a price point, they've hinted that the product works with more than 25 applications and could benefit remote work and school.

Apple is planning to release a new thinner and lighter MacBook Air that will launch in the second half of this year or early next year, according to Bloomberg.
The report said Apple will plan to market the device as a higher-end version of the current MacBook Air, which Apple released in November with its new M1 processor. That device was among three new Apple computers to make the switch away from Intel chips.
Apple's Mac revenue was up 28% year over year, when the company reported its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in October. That boost was helped by millions of people forced to work from home because of Covid.
The new MacBook Air will include Apple's magnetic charging system called MagSafe, according to the report. MagSafe was used in Apple laptops for years before it was removed over two years ago in place of newer USB-C charging. But, it's convenient because it allows the charger to pop out easily and helps prevent the laptop from being dragged off a surface if someone pulls the cord or trips on it. MagSafe is also used in the latest iPhone 12 phones, though it has a different design and relies on a magnetic puck accessory that wirelessly charges the phones.
Top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of TFI said earlier this month that Apple is planning to launch two new MacBook Pro laptops this year — with 14- and 16-inch screens and with MagSafe. Bloomberg confirmed the report but added Apple is also planning an iMac with Face ID, which means it would unlock when you look at it, a smaller version of the Mac Pro computer and a new Mac Pro with an Intel processor.

The past six years of speculation around the so-called Apple Car have been a roller coaster. First Apple was reportedly building a car. Then the company wasn't building a car, just the guts of a vehicle. Most recently, sources told CNBC that Apple will manufacture an autonomous car with Hyundai and Kia in Georgia. Now that might be out, too.
Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world, and it could become massively more valuable if it can make a splash in cars – the global auto and mobility market is worth about $10 trillion compared with the $715 billion smartphone market, according to Mordor Intelligence.
Apple did not respond to a request for comment.
Watch CNBC's deep dive into the Apple Car to find out more.

Shares of Apple closed up 5.39% on Monday to a price of $127.79, outpacing the NASDAQ, which was only up 3.01% percent. It was Apple's biggest day since Oct. 12, when shares rose 6.35%.
The bump came after Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO Warren Buffett said in his annual letter to investors published this weekend that his investment firm owns 5.4% of Apple's stock, making it Berkshire's third-most valuable asset. The letter praised Apple's approach to dividends and share buybacks.
""Berkshire's investment in Apple vividly illustrates the power of repurchases,"" Buffett wrote.
Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway started buying Apple in 2016 after years of avoiding tech stocks. Apple's success last year largely offset damage from the pandemic to the investor's railroad and insurance businesses.
Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway, like Apple, plans to repurchase its shares.
Apple's rise also comes after the company confirmed on Monday that all 270 of its U.S. retail stores are open for business, although some remain appointment-only.
Monday marked the first time that all U.S. stores are open since Apple started closing them in response to the Covid-19 pandemic last spring.
Apple reopened and reclosed its stores several times during the past year in response to local Covid-19 conditions, and Monday's milestone suggests Apple's retail business is starting to return to normal.

Apple shareholders on Tuesday voted to re-elect the company's board of directors and approve 2020 pay for executives, including CEO Tim Cook.
The vote was nonbinding and advisory. Apple shareholders also voted down a shareholder proposal opposed by Apple that would compel the company to reduce executive pay compared with median Apple employee pay.
The votes, which were expected, are another sign that Apple's shareholders are satisfied with the company's management and CEO. Apple, valued at more than $2.1 trillion, recently reported a quarter with $111.4 billion in revenue and sales growth in every product category, even during a pandemic year.
Apple's board strongly supported Cook's pay package in a filing, citing a 867% return to shareholders, including dividends, from when he took over as Apple CEO in 2011 through September 2020.
Apple's proxy also included information about an equity package announced last year that could net CEO Tim Cook 1 million new shares if the company hits certain goals. However, that equity package was not granted until Sept. 27, 2020, which was the first day of Apple's 2021 fiscal year. So this year's shareholder vote on executive compensation did not actually cover that grant.
Cook also said that Apple planned to increase the company's dividend. Dividends totaled over $14 billion in the last four quarters, he said. The company paid a dividend of 20.5 cents per share in the last two quarters.
Covid-19 and Apple's success as a business during a pandemic year was major theme of Cook's remarks to shareholders. Last year, Cook said the pandemic was the most challenging environment Apple's ever faced.
""A year later, you have to pause, and say wow,"" he said.
Cook said in a question-and-answer session that while Apple had adapted well to remote work — Apple employees have been working from home since March — the company still ""can't wait until we can gather together in the office again,"" suggesting that Apple will still be office focused after the pandemic, in comparison to rival tech companies that have announced plans to shift to a remote work model.
He said that one advantage of working from an office was serendipitous interactions between employees.
Cook also talked about Apple's acquisitions strategy. He said that Apple has acquired 100 companies over the last six years. Ultimately, Apple acquires a company every three to four weeks, Cook said, mostly aimed at acquiring technology and talent.
In response to a shareholder question about whether Apple faces regulatory challenges around its control of the iPhone App Store, Cook said that Apple doesn't have a monopoly. ""While scrutiny is always fair, accusations like these fall apart on a reasonable examination of the facts,"" he said.
Correction: This year's shareholder vote on executive compensation did not encompass the new restricted stock unit (RSU) award granted to Tim Cook on the first day of Apple's 2021 fiscal year. An earlier version of this story also misstated Apple's revenue for the last quarter, which was $111.4 billion.

If you subscribe to a bunch of Apple services, like Music, News+, Fitness, Arcade and iCloud storage, you can save money by buying one of the Apple One bundles, which package services at a discount.
You'll save up to $25 a month if you already pay for a bunch of Apple's services. Apple's Family and Premier plans will offer access to premium services for up to six people, so you can share with your family.
For example, since I was spending $26 for my personal Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple News+ and 50GB of iCloud storage, I decided to move to the Apple One Premier plan. It costs $29.95 per month but now allows me to share all of those subscriptions with my wife and parents, who were also paying separately.
But in talking to people, I've learned that some folks aren't always sure what they already pay for and if a bundle will save them any money. So here's a quick guide that will show you how to figure out which services you already pay for and how to select the right plan for you and your family.
Move through this list. You may have many subscriptions from lots of apps if you've signed up inside them. But look for the Apple ones, like Music, Arcade, News+, iCloud, Apple TV+, Arcade and Fitness+. Then find out if multiple people are using each service.
If you add all of those up, including the family plan for Apple Music, you're paying about $55 per month. You'll save $25 per month by signing up for the Apple One Premier plan, which includes everything above for $29.95 per month. And your entire family will be able to use the services.
You can even save significant bucks even if you only use some of those services. Say your family uses Apple Music and Apple TV+, but each person pays for their own iCloud storage. A family of six could save $8 by moving to the Apple One Family plan, which includes Apple Music, Apple TV+, Arcade and 200GB of iCloud storage.
Lastly, maybe you're flying solo. You pay for Apple Music, Apple TV+ and 50GB of iCloud storage. That's about $16 a month. But, if you switch to the Apple One Family plan, you'll save $1 and get Apple Arcade free (or you'll just save $6 if you're already paying for Apple Arcade.)

All 270 Apple stores in the United States are open for business on Monday, a company spokesperson confirmed.
It's the first time that all U.S. stores are open since Apple started closing stores in response to the Covid-19 pandemic last spring. Apple reopened its last closed U.S. locations in Texas on Monday. 
The United States is beginning to emerge from lockdowns as the number of new cases falls and vaccines are distributed.
Not all Apple stores in the U.S. are fully open for walk-in customers to go inside and browse, however. Customers should check Apple's website before heading to their store in case it is appointment-only or service is limited in other ways.
Last year, on March 13, Apple announced it was closing all its stores outside China as the coronavirus pandemic started to pick up around the world. At the time, the closings were only scheduled through March 27, although it soon became clear that the lockdowns would stretch for months.
Since that first announcement, Apple has reopened and reclosed locations around the world in response to Covid-19 conditions, often deciding to temporarily close a store ahead of official government restrictions.
In response to the pandemic, Apple experimented with new store services, including appointment-only service or shopping, and an ""express pickup"" option that gets customers in and out quickly. Apple also started to require masks in stores and implemented health and safety guidelines that included reduced occupancy.
Around the world, 12 Apple stores in France and two stores in Brazil are still closed. Two stores in Mexico reopen on Tuesday.
9to5Mac first reported that all U.S. Apple stores were open.
Apple has not had problems selling its products while its stores have been closed, especially through its online store, which has been open. However, Apple CEO Tim Cook said recently that its holiday quarter could have been even bigger if its physical stores had been open.
Although the pandemic appears to be slowing down in the U.S. and businesses are reopening, the country is still recording at least 67,300 new cases of Covid-19 and at least 2,010 deaths each day, according to a seven-day average calculated by CNBC using Johns Hopkins University data.
However, the pace of vaccines being administered throughout the country continues to increase, raising hope that business could return to normal later this year. According to the CDC, 49.8 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.

Target wants to give shoppers another reason to skip trips to the mall: It's adding mini Apple stores to some locations, with more space devoted to iPhones and other popular gadgets.
The retailer said Thursday that the shops will open in 17 Target stores this month, and it plans to expand to more locations in the fall. Target already sells Apple merchandise, but the shops will double the tech company's footprint inside of each store, include more accessories and have staff with specialized training from Apple. The brand's products have a new look on Target's website, too.
Target Chief Growth Officer Christina Hennington said the dedicated area will catch customers' eyes and make its sales floor more experiential. It will also have videos and displays that are more engaging, she said.
""When we have something that is uniquely compelling and different, whether it's in the assortment, how the experience is brought together or service — which is a big component of what we are talking about with the Apple experience — it draws our guests in, which then drives traffic, and of course sales over time,"" she said.
In a statement, Apple said the company looks forward to ""continuing to work with Target on exciting new ways to serve customers in-store and online.""
For some consumers, a stop at Target's stores has taken the place of hours-long shopping trips to multiple retailers during the pandemic. The big-box retailer has seen significant sales growth because it stayed open as an essential retailer in the early part of the global health crisis and then capitalized on convenience with its wide range of merchandise, curbside pickup and third-party delivery service Shipt.
That has translated to $6 billion in market-share gains as of the end of the third quarter, the company said, citing third-party and internal research. Its stock price has soared, too. As of Wednesday's close, Target shares are up about 64% over the past year. Its market value is $93.68 billion.
After its huge quarterly gains, the discounter will face challenging comparisons. Consumers could return to old habits as the pandemic wanes, like returning to multiple stores instead of consolidating trips at Target. Some investors have already grown skeptical of stocks that have benefited from stay-at-home trends. The company plans to report fourth-quarter earnings and host a virtual investor day on Tuesday.
Target's leaders have said they can sustain the upward trajectory by taking sales from struggling retailers and offering unique merchandise that grabs customers' attention and more of their budgets. It has launched private labels such as athleisure line All in Motion and limited-time collections with beloved brands such as Lilly Pulitzer and Hunter.
It has also tried Disney shops in some stores and featured Levi's jeans and apparel in a dedicated area. It will open hundreds of scaled-down Ulta Beauty shops later this year with curated products and trained makeup and skin-care professionals.
With its latest ""shop in shop,"" Target will feature Apple — a brand that's a draw for shoppers and a common hangout spot at malls. It will resemble the tech company's stores with new lighting and lowered tables where customers can try out Apple products.
It will not have an Apple trademark — the ""Genius Bar"" — where customers can get concierge-like tech support. Hennington said Target hasn't ruled out adding that in the future.
Hennington declined to share financial terms of the deal. She said it has been in discussions with Apple about the idea for months and collaborated with the tech company to pick the locations for the shops.
She said technology played a central role this year in keeping people safe and entertained. She said the retailer sees it as a growth category, particularly because of Apple's following among customers.
Sales in Target's electronics category grew by 50% in the third quarter and more than 20% during the holiday season compared with the same period a year earlier.
Nearly a decade ago, the retailer tested a concept to showcase Apple in some stores with more prominent display, but the company said this new effort is a separate strategy and goes much further than swapping out signage.
Here's a list of the first 17 Target locations that will have the Apple shops:

After years of speculation that it will eventually get into the auto business with its own vehicle, Apple is close to finalizing a deal with Hyundai-Kia to manufacture an Apple-branded autonomous electric vehicle at the Kia assembly plant in West Point, Georgia according to multiple sources who briefed CNBC on the plan.  
The so-called ""Apple Car,"" which is being developed by a team at Apple, is tentatively scheduled to go into production in 2024, though people familiar with the talks between Apple and Hyundai-Kia say the eventual rollout could be pushed back.  
Sources tell CNBC no agreement has yet been reached between the two companies. In addition, they stress that Apple may ultimately decide to partner with another automaker separately or in addition to working with Hyundai.  
One source familiar with Apple's strategy on developing a car tells CNBC, ""I doubt Hyundai is the only automaker they could strike a deal with, there could be somebody else.""
Apple shares rose more than 2% after hours on the news.
Spokespersons for both Apple and Hyundai-Kia declined to comment when reached by CNBC.
If an agreement is finalized, why would Apple choose Hyundai-Kia? Just as importantly, why would the Korean automaker strike a deal with Apple?
Those familiar with the discussions say each company sees a unique benefit in working with the other to develop an Apple car.
For Apple, the decision to build a car opens the potential to tap a global auto and mobility market valued at $10 trillion. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty explained the profit potential for Apple in a research note she issued in January. 
""Smartphones are a $500bn annual TAM. Apple has about one-third of this market. The mobility market is $10 trillion. So Apple would only need a 2% share of this market to be the size of their iPhone business,"" Huberty wrote. 
Sources familiar with Apple's interest in working with Hyundai say the tech giant wants to build the ""Apple Car"" in North America with an established automaker willing to allow Apple to control the software and hardware that will go into the vehicle.    
In other words, this will be an ""Apple Car,"" not a Kia model featuring Apple software.   
For Hyundai-Kia, working with Apple is being driven by the company's new chairman, Euisun Chung, who took control of the Korean automaker last October.  According to one source familiar with Hyundai-Kia strategy, ""Chung has made it clear, mobility is the future of the company.""  That's important because the Apple Car will be fully autonomous. 
By working with Apple, leaders of Hyundai-Kia believe they will accelerate development of their own autonomous and electric and vehicle plans.  Hyundai is currently partnered with Aptiv in a joint-venture developing autonomous vehicle technology, including robotaxis. 
There is no indication that joint venture would change if Hyundai reaches an agreement with Apple.  In addition, the Kia plant about 90 minutes southwest of Atlanta, Georgia, has available capacity, so scaling production and tapping the Hyundai-Kia supply chain can be done relatively quickly.
While it is still unclear exactly what the first Apple Car will look like, those familiar with the plans say there are a couple of notable features. 
""The first Apple Cars will not be designed to have a driver,"" said one source with knowledge of the current plan. ""These will be autonomous, electric vehicles designed to operate without a driver and focused on the last mile.""  That could mean Apple cars, at least initially, could focus on package food delivery operations and firms incorporating robotaxis.
The move could bring the tech giant into direct competition with Tesla, which is rolling out self-driving features for its vehicles. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently told investors that turning Teslas into self-driving robotaxis could help justify the company's valuation, as the cars would be in use for more hours per day, allowing Tesla to earn higher revenues per car. In 2018, Apple lured Doug Field, then Tesla's senior VP of engineering, back to Apple where he had previously worked, presumably to work on self-driving cars. Apple has also hired myriad other former Tesla employees, including Michael Schwekutsch, now Senior Director of Engineering for the Special Projects Group at Apple and formerly Tesla Vice President of Engineering.
Musk said that he once attempted to start talks with Apple about acquiring his electric car company, but Apple CEO Tim Cook rejected his invitation to meet.

In 2007, Apple unveiled the iPhone.
Apple didn't invent the smartphone — companies like Palm and Blackberry had been selling them for years. But the iPhone introduced a totally new way to interact with computers. The always-on internet connectivity, finger-friendly touch screen, and interface based around clickable app icons all seem commonplace now. But at the time, the whole package felt revolutionary.
The smartphone was a seismic shift for the technology industry, creating entirely new business models — apps became $100 billion companies -- while replacing everything from digital cameras to in-car GPS systems.
But smartphone sales have dropped two calendar years straight for the first time, according to Gartner. Smartphones are old news.
The tech industry's next bet is a series of technologies usually called augmented reality (AR) or mixed reality. The vision usually involves some kind of computer worn in front of the user's eyes.
Users will still be able to see most of the real world in front of them — unlike virtual reality, which completely immerses the user in a computer-generated fantasyland, augmented reality layers computer-generated text and images on top of reality.
Industry watchers and participants think that Apple has a good chance to validate and revolutionize AR like it did with smartphones. Apple has been prototyping headsets for years, and recent reports from The Information and Bloomberg suggest that Apple could release a headset as early as 2022 that could cost as much as $3,000.
But Apple's not the only company working on these products. All the big tech players — Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Amazon — are in the game as well.
Futurists and screenwriters have conjured blue-sky visions of what could happen with advanced computer glasses — one episode of the dystopian anthology ""Black Mirror"" explored a world where people could ""block"" certain people out of their view. More positive visions imagine having important information coming directly into your view, exactly when you want it.
Today, the most common use cases are much more mundane, including smartphone-based games and apps like Pokemon Go or Apple's Ruler app, which use the phone's screen and camera rather than relying on glasses or another set of screens sitting on your face. The few companies who are actively producing AR glasses are mostly focused on work scenarios, like manufacturing and medicine.
""That's where we now sit in spatial computing's lifecycle. It's not the revolutionary platform shift touted circa-2016,"" said Mike Boland, technology analyst and founder of ARtillery Intelligence, in a recent report. ""It's not a silver bullet for everything we do in life and work as once hyped. But it will be transformative in narrower ways, and within a targeted set of use cases and verticals.""
Here's what the biggest companies in tech are doing to try and make augmented reality the next big thing:
Apple's generation-defining success with the iPhone has made it the company to watch in augmented reality -- even though the company has never confirmed it is working on a headset, glasses or any other kind of head-worn computer.
Boland says that if Apple were to release a pair of AR glasses, it could ""determine the fate of the AR industry,"" given the company's track record of popularizing new technologies.
A report from Bloomberg last month suggested Apple's first AR product could be out as early as next year. Its first shot will reportedly a battery-powered headset that's primarily designed for virtual reality, but with on-board cameras to enable augmented reality as well. The report says this device could cost thousands of dollars and be available only in low volumes -- more typical of a test platform for software developers than the mass-market products Apple usually releases.
Eventually Apple could take lessons it learns from the virtual reality headset and apply it to a pair of lightweight AR glasses with transparent displays. But according to Bloomberg, that project still faces additional work on technical issues such as miniaturization and lens technology.
Display technology is another limiting factors for augmented reality. The transparent displays currently on the market have a limited field of view in which they can display graphics, are often not bright enough for daylight use, and generally could be better suited for all-day wear.
Apple's working on solving this problem, too, according to a report in Nikkei Asia. The newspaper says that Apple is working with TSMC, its primary processor manufacturer, to develop a new kind of augmented reality display that's printed directly on wafers, or the base layer for chips.
If Apple does eventually reveal a big leap forward in AR display technology -- especially if the technology is developed and owned by Apple instead of a supplier -- Apple could find itself with multi-year head-start in augmented reality as it did when the iPhone vaulted it to the head of the smartphone industry.
Of course, that's assuming that there's software worth using when the headset comes out. But Apple has already laid the groundwork for a rich software library.
In 2017, Apple released software called ARKit, which includes tools for software makers to determine how far away an object or wall is, if the phone is moving, or identify limbs in a human body, among other functions.
Companies like Ikea, Target, and Amazon have already used ARKit, mostly for placing virtual furniture in a room to see if it fits. Warby Parker uses it to enable virtual glasses try-ons through its app. Snap uses new iPhone 3D sensors to improve its face-shifting lenses, which advertisers can purchase. But so far, few ARKit apps have found a wider audience.
Apple is also adding hardware to its iPhones that hint at a headset-based future. High-end iPhones released in 2020 include advanced Lidar sensors embedded in their camera. These sensors can measure how far away objects are, and are currently used to execute fun filters and photo effects. But when paired with an advanced headset, their use could be more profound. Apple is considering using lidar sensors on its headset, according to The Information.
One way to look at Apple's investment in the technology is to look at the companies it's bought in the field. It's bought a company that builds transparent optics, a headset maker, and companies that make software and content for augmented and virtual reality, including Akonia Holographics, Vrvana, Metaio, Emotient, Flyby Media, Spaces, and NextVR.
Google was the first major technology company to release a head-worn computer when it introduced Google Glass in 2013. It cost $1,500 at the time, and was explicitly targeted at people in the computer industry and early adopters, which Google called ""explorers.""
Google's approach was significantly lighter and simpler than what's come since. Google Glass did not attempt to use advanced processing to integrate computer graphics into the real world. Instead, it was equipped with a camera, and had a little transparent display with relatively low resolution on the right temple. That display was used to project small bits of information into the user's field of vision -- sort of like an Apple Watch or smartwatch on the user's face.
But Google Glass was also a lightning rod for criticism -- it had a built-in video camera, and people who weren't wearing it felt like they were being watched. One wearer said she was assaulted outside a San Francisco bar in 2014 for wearing the glasses.
Google paused Glass in 2015 and rejiggered it for business users. Last year, it started selling Google Glass for $999 per unit through some of its hardware resellers.
One key application for Glass is Augmedix, which uses the headset's camera to cut down on the time doctors spend on busywork. The Glass camera streams an interaction with patients to ""scribes"" hired by the company who write down the important details and enter them into the patient record.
Last year, Google acquired North, a Canadian company making a pair of lightweight $1,000 smartglasses.
Microsoft announced its augmented reality headset, Hololens, in 2015, and released the first version in 2016. It's now on its second version, which costs $3,500. It's a niche device targeted for business sales. (Microsoft's tagline: ""Work smarter with mixed reality."")
On its website, Microsoft touts manufacturing, retail, and healthcare as primary use cases. In factories, the headset can inform workers about how to fix or operate a complicated machine. Retailers, instead of having costly display items or large amounts of inventory, can virtually display their goods to customers, Microsoft suggests.
Microsoft's store currently has 343 HoloLens apps. None are household names, and many are simple demos that display graphics like a birthday cake or fireworks.
Microsoft has invested heavily in these kind of technologies, purchasing AltspaceVR, a social network for virtual reality, in 2018. Before it launched Hololens, it paid $150 million for intellectual property from a smartglasses pioneer. It doesn't break out Hololens sales or revenue.
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks the most in public about his hopes for augmented reality. Last year, he said, ""While I expect phones to still be our primary devices through most of this decade, at some point in the 2020s, we will get breakthrough augmented reality glasses that will redefine our relationship with technology.""
Facebook's enthusiasm for augmented reality is driven in part by its dependence on smartphone platforms from other vendors today. In particular, Facebook has been balking at Apple's control over the iPhone for years, and the fight has escalated recently as Apple is planning technical changes to the iPhone software that will hurt Facebook's main moneymaker, mobile advertising.
If Facebook creates the next big platform, then it will set the rules.
Zuckerberg is also predicting massive societal change stemming from augmented reality: ""Imagine if you could live anywhere you chose and access any job anywhere else.""
Facebook is already a leader in virtual reality, augmented reality's cousin. It bought Oculus for $2 billion in 2014, a move that signaled the start of massive investment in these technologies. The latest Oculus headset includes cameras, costs $300, and sold 1 million units in December, according to an estimate from SuperData.
With cameras mounted on the front and powerful processing, virtual reality headsets can approximate augmented reality by displaying a real-time feed of the outside world. This feature is called ""passthrough"" on recent Oculus headsets, and it could be Apple's initial approach as well.
The company is also working on lightweight AR glasses and hopes to launch a product this year in partnership with Luxottica, the sunglasses giant, CNBC previously reported.
Facebook is also working on ""Project Aria,"" which is a research-oriented pair of computer glasses that don't have advanced AR displays, but can record video, audio, track the user's eyes, and access location data.
Amazon is the tech giant with the least public enthusiasm about augmented reality technology, but it does sell a pair of smart glasses called Echo Frames. These don't even have a display. Instead, the user interacts entirely through Alexa, Amazon's voice assistant.
Amazon is also attacking augmented reality different angles. Last fall it released an ""Amazon Augmented Reality"" app, but it's not a serious piece of software. Instead, it uses QR codes on Amazon shipping boxes to activate fun mini-games, like turning an Amazon box into a race car, or putting fun sunglasses on a dog.
""Augmented reality is a fun way to reuse your Amazon boxes until you're ready to drop them in the recycling bin,"" according to the app's description.
Other Amazon applications use augmented reality to place virtual furniture inside the user's home to make sure it fits before making an online purchase.
But Amazon has many of the pieces to take augmented reality more seriously. It has expertise in computer vision, or the software that can identify what objects in a photo or video are. It has an industry-leading voice assistant that could be deeply integrated with the headset.
Amazon also has hundreds of thousands of warehouse workers that could be early adopters of AR glasses — one commonly pitched use case is to help ""pickers"" find items in a large warehouse more easily by highlighting them with computer graphics.

Shares of electric vehicle start-up Fisker surged more than 20% in morning trading Wednesday after the company announced a manufacturing deal with Foxconn Technology Group.
The two companies have signed a memorandum of understanding for the Taiwan-based electronics contract manufacturer, best known for assembling Apple iPhones, to produce more than 250,000 electric vehicles a year for Fisker, according to a joint announcement Wednesday from the companies.
Fisker, which went public through a reverse merger last year, has a market cap of $5.26 billion.
Assembly of the vehicle is expected to start in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to the companies. Officials provided few other details about the planned EV other than it will be for a ""new segment vehicle.""
""We will create a vehicle that crosses social borders, while offering a combination of advanced technology, desirable design, innovation and value for money, whilst delivering on our commitment to create the world's most sustainable vehicles,"" Fisker CEO Henrik Fisker said in a statement.
The companies said the deal – codenamed ""Project PEAR"" (Personal Electric Automotive Revolution) – is expected to close in the second quarter of this year. It would be Fisker's second major deal in recent months. The company already has a deal with auto supplier Magna to produce the Fisker Ocean, its first expected vehicle.
Magna and Fisker expect to start production on the Ocean in the fourth quarter of 2022. The Ocean will initially be manufactured exclusively by Magna in Europe.

LONDON — France Digitale, a French start-up lobby group, filed a complaint against Apple with the nation's privacy regulator, arguing that the iPhone maker's iOS 14 mobile operating system may be in breach of European Union rules.
The campaign group, which has around 2,000 members, filed a seven-page complaint, seen by CNBC, with the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés on Tuesday.
It argues that Apple may be collecting user data for ad tracking services without explicitly asking permission, and it is calling on the CNIL to investigate. Specifically, it thinks that Apple has its ""Personalized Ads"" option on by default on iPhones with iOS 14 installed.
Apple said the allegations in the complaint are false.
""Our suspicion is that this is a very severe breach of our privacy regulations,"" France Digitale CEO Nicolas Brien told CNBC, adding that Apple could be breaching Europe's General Data Protection Regulation and the Electronic Privacy Directive, also known as the e-Privacy directive.
""Our problem here is that you don't get the choice to consent,"" said Brien. ""It's automatically on and that's strictly forbidden by GDPR and e-Privacy.""
An Apple spokesperson told CNBC: ""The allegations in the complaint are patently false and will be seen for what they are, a poor attempt by those who track users to distract from their own actions and mislead regulators and policymakers.""
They added: ""Privacy is built into the ads we sell on our platform with no tracking. We hold ourselves to a higher standard by allowing users to opt out of Apple's limited first-party data use for personalized advertising, a feature that makes us unique.""
France Digitale has also criticized Apple for its App Store practices in recent weeks, saying that they harm start-ups.
Apple only lets developers release iPhone and iPad apps through its iOS smartphone platform. The firm has a rigorous approval process for iOS apps and has faced criticism about fees of up to 30% which it charges on in-app transactions.
Last year, the EU Commission launched antitrust investigations into Apple's App Store rules and its Apple Pay mobile wallet. Epic Games, creator of the popular video game Fortnite, has been particularly vocal in its criticism of Apple. At the time, Apple said it was ""disappointing"" that the European Commission is listening to ""baseless complaints"" from a small number of businesses.
The U.K.'s competition regulator launched its own antitrust investigation into Apple on March 4. The Competition and Markets Authority said it would investigate Apple over complaints from software developers about the tech giant's App Store.
Apple said it would work with the CMA to address its concerns. ""We believe in thriving and competitive markets where any great idea can flourish,"" a spokesperson for the company said earlier this month.
While Europe is clamping down on America's Big Tech firms, Brien still thinks companies like Apple are getting a relatively easy ride.
He claims that Apple is not under the same level of privacy scrutiny as French start-ups and other small companies.
""We are getting investigated all the time,"" said Brien. ""We need that to stop. Tech regulations should not be primarily aimed at start-ups.""
A spokesperson for the CNIL confirmed to CNBC that it had received the complaint and that it planned to investigate.
Brien said he thinks privacy regulators in other countries may also investigate Apple when they learn about the feature France Digitale has taken issue with.
""This is something huge and we do believe it's an extremely important case,"" he said. ""We're talking here about the most valuable tech company and if they are not playing by the rules, who else has got to be?""
Apple has positioned itself as a company that takes privacy more seriously than Silicon Valley neighbors Google and Facebook.

Apple has announced that it plans to create a major new chip lab in Munich as part of a 1 billion euro ($1.19 billion) plus investment into Germany over the next three years.
The Cupertino firm announced on Wednesday that it will open a new 30,000-square-meter facility in central Munich's Karlstrasse later next year.
Apple said it will make Munich its ""European Silicon Design Center"" and hire hundreds of new employees in the Bavarian capital.
Apple claimed the new facility will be Europe's largest research and development site for mobile wireless semiconductors and software, suggesting it will eclipse similar sites like Arm's in Cambridge and NXP's in Eidenhoven.
The announcement comes as the world is struggling through a chip shortage that has inflicted pain on the automotive sector and other industries.  The global chip shortage has worried governments around the world. Semiconductors are used in almost all electronic devices, from laptops and mobile phones to the brake sensors in our cars.
Engineers at Apple's new facility will focus on 5G and future wireless technologies, Apple said, adding that they'll also develop modems for Apple products.
Apple has 4,000 staff across Germany and it already employs 1,500 engineers across seven offices in Munich. It's possible that some of them will be consolidated under one roof when the new building is ready.
Apple said its existing engineers in Munich work on areas like power management design, application processors and wireless technologies. Together, they have improved performance and efficiency on iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Mac with the M1 chip, it added.
""I couldn't be more excited for everything our Munich engineering teams will discover — from exploring the new frontiers of 5G technology, to a new generation of technologies that bring power, speed, and connectivity to the world,"" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO, in a statement.
""Munich has been a home to Apple for four decades, and we're grateful to this community and to Germany for being a part of our journey.""
Apple claims it has spent over 15 billion euros with over 700 companies in Germany over the last five years including chip maker Infineon and battery firm Varta.
Nathan Benaich, a venture capital investor who has backed chip start-up Graphcore, told CNBC that the new chip lab is a strong move by Apple and he's bullish.
""I think vertical integration for Apple means greater control over their supply chain and margins, but most importantly the flexibility to design exactly what they need to power the products they want to build,"" he said. ""In contrast to having to build with what is available or convince suppliers to do so.""
Munich is one of Europe's leading tech hubs and other tech giants use it for R&D — Google employs around 1,000 people in the city. It's also home to car giants like BMW and Audi, which have thousands of engineers who Apple may look to hire for its reported Apple car project.
On Tuesday, the European Union announced plans to become less reliant on technologies traditionally manufactured outside of the bloc, such as the ramping up of chip production.
Apple isn't the only one setting up new chip labs in Europe, which is home to some of the world's top universities. Chinese tech giant Huawei got the green light last June to build a £1 billion chip research facility in Cambridge, England.

The recent sell-off of Apple stock has presented a perfect buying opportunity for investors, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.
Apple shareholders have dumped stock in the company over the last month or so after the iPhone maker came off a historic December quarter. As a result, Apple's share price fell from a high of $143.16 on Jan. 26 to $116.36 on Monday. Apple was last seen trading at $120.74 at around 10:05 a.m. ET on Wednesday.
""The recent sell-off creates a golden buying opportunity,"" Ives said in a note.
Here, Wedbush's Ives outlines why he believes Apple's ""supercycle party"" could put the company on course for a $3 trillion market cap.

Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson on Tuesday told CNBC that the electric vehicle newcomer has no issue facing potential competition from one of the the most valuable companies on the planet.
Apple, which commands a $2.1 trillion valuation, is rumored to be interested in putting an electrified car on the road.
""I welcome the competition from a company like Apple,"" Rawlinson said in a ""Mad Money"" interview. ""Ultimately, you know, this is a technology race. Tesla recognizes that and Lucid recognizes that, and I think that's what differentiates so many of the traditional car companies.""
Speculation about a vehicle project, a so-called Apple Car, has been swirling for years. Reports about a car under development or a potential production deal with Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors have ultimately proven to be fruitless thus far.
Should Apple enter the car market, it will play in a global auto and mobility market that's worth roughly $10 trillion, a substantial opportunity compared to the $715 billion smartphone market, according to data from Mordor Intelligence.
Rawlinson suggests there's enough space for his company to compete.
""There's always room for new entries, and don't ... underestimate the [car] market, because this isn't a market for EVs. There's no such thing as an EV market,"" said Rawlinson, formerly of Tesla. ""This is a market for cars and EVs will penetrate and completely fill that.""
Lucid plans to deliver its first car, the all-electric Air luxury sedan, in the second half of the year. The Lucid Air will be available across multiple price points, ranging from $69,900 for the Pure model to $161,500 for the Dream Edition.
The Newark, California-based manufacturer plans to have an electric SUV called Project Gravity ready by 2023, along with other sedans, SUVs and vehicles to be produced within the next decade.
The privately held company announced last month that it would go public through a SPAC, or special purpose acquisition company, in what would be the largest blank-check merger involving an EV company.

Twitter CFO Ned Segal on Wednesday said the social media company is feeling confident as it prepares for Apple's planned privacy update to iOS 14, which will make it easier for iPhone and iPad users to block companies from tracking their activity to target ads.
""We look at the unique signal that Twitter has with a growing audience, with better formats and more relevance and the ability to better leverage that signal, much of which isn't tied to a device ID,"" Segal said, speaking at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference. ""We feel really good about our ability to leverage that combination.""
Apple's upcoming privacy changes will inform users about device ID tracking and ask them if they want to allow it. The tracking is based on a unique device identifier on every iPhone and iPad called the IDFA. Companies that sell mobile advertisements use this ID to help target ads and estimate their effectiveness.
Apple has said that the change will roll out early this spring.
Segal said that the changes to IDFA could actually present an opportunity for Twitter to compete more effectively against its peers.
""IDFA in a way is going to level the playing field. We're in an industry where many were much better than Twitter historically at leveraging all of the data that was available to them, from the device ID to what people were doing on other websites,"" Segal said. ""When we all have the same set of new challenges that we have to face, leveling the playing field will be a really interesting impact on the broader industry.""
Segal said that Twitter is planning to sit back and wait rather than immediately asking its iOS users if they want to opt into IDFA tracking, like Facebook is planning to do.
""We don't want to be in a rush around IDFA,"" he said. ""You only have one chance to ask somebody if you can have access to their device ID to show them more relevant ads. You want to ask in a really thoughtful way, and you want to take time to learn from the industry and the broader ecosystem before you ask a question like that.""

Shares of Apple closed up 5.39% on Monday to a price of $127.79, outpacing the NASDAQ, which was only up 3.01% percent. It was Apple's biggest day since Oct. 12, when shares rose 6.35%.
The bump came after Berkshire Hathaway chairman and CEO Warren Buffett said in his annual letter to investors published this weekend that his investment firm owns 5.4% of Apple's stock, making it Berkshire's third-most valuable asset. The letter praised Apple's approach to dividends and share buybacks.
""Berkshire's investment in Apple vividly illustrates the power of repurchases,"" Buffett wrote.
Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway started buying Apple in 2016 after years of avoiding tech stocks. Apple's success last year largely offset damage from the pandemic to the investor's railroad and insurance businesses.
Buffett said Berkshire Hathaway, like Apple, plans to repurchase its shares.
Apple's rise also comes after the company confirmed on Monday that all 270 of its U.S. retail stores are open for business, although some remain appointment-only.
Monday marked the first time that all U.S. stores are open since Apple started closing them in response to the Covid-19 pandemic last spring.
Apple reopened and reclosed its stores several times during the past year in response to local Covid-19 conditions, and Monday's milestone suggests Apple's retail business is starting to return to normal.

Apple will add two new English language voices to its Siri voice assistant in an upcoming version of its iPhone software, the company said on Wednesday. Users will be able to choose from four voices for Siri, which will no longer default to a female voice in the U.S.
The change is currently available in a beta version of iOS 14.5 that was released on Wednesday. Apple previously said the update will be released for everyone sometime in ""early spring.""
Digital assistants with default female voices have been scrutinized by researchers in recent years, with critics saying the choices reflect a male-dominated artificial intelligence industry and reinforce stereotypes.
""We're excited to introduce two new Siri voices for English speakers and the option for Siri users to select the voice they want when they set up their device,"" an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. ""This is a continuation of Apple's long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, and products and services that are designed to better reflect the diversity of the world we live in.""
Apple previously offered male voices as the default in some regions, as well as Australian and British accents, but it has defaulted to a woman's voice in the U.S. since its release in 2011.
Amazon's Alexa and Google Assistant both currently default to feminine voices for English speakers but offer a range of alternative voice options.
Apple's iOS 14.5 will be a major update for iPhones. In addition to the new voices, it will add the ability to unlock a phone with an Apple Watch, new emojis including one that depicts a vaccine, and will include a privacy change restricting access to a device ID that mobile advertisers use.

Apple could release new iPads as soon as April, according to a report in Bloomberg.
The new iPads will be part of Apple's high-end iPad Pro line and could feature improved cameras, a faster processor, and a new type of Mini-LED display on the largest iPad with improved brightness and contrast.
Otherwise, they will look similar to the current 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros, according to the report. Apple's current 11-inch iPad Pro costs $799 and the larger model starts at $999.
The report comes as Apple's iPad business has been boosted by people looking for computers to work and play from home during the Covid-19 pandemic. During the most recent holiday quarter, Apple reported $8.4 billion in iPad sales, an increase of more than 42% increase from the previous year.
Apple typically releases most of its new products, including iPhones, in the fall, but sometimes delivers less significant product updates during a launch event in the spring. The Cupertino-based giant has not announced a spring launch event this year.
In recent years, Apple has been positioning its iPad Pro models as laptop replacements, including introducing mouse support and keyboard accessories like the $299 Magic Keyboard.

Apple sued a former employee in federal court in California on Thursday, alleging that Simon Lancaster, who worked as a product design architect, passed trade secrets to a member of the media, and asked for favorable coverage of companies he was involved with in return. 
In its lawsuit, Apple did not name the media correspondent nor the details that Lancaster allegedly leaked.
The lawsuit highlights Apple's approach to building products in complete secrecy. While all technology firms closely guard intellectual property, Apple's culture deeply emphasizes it and the company has developed a need-to-know system called ""disclosure"" where often employees on a project don't have knowledge of other parts of the project to prevent leaks.
According to the suit, a reporter reached out to Lancaster in 2018 and the two communicated over the next year before Lancaster left Apple in November 2019. During that time, Lancaster provided the reporter with information about unreleased products, including internal documents, according to the lawsuit. At one point, Lancaster told another contact that the reporter would cover a company he was involved with if it secured $1 million in funding. 
In November 2019, Arris Composites announced that it had hired Lancaster. 
Apple considers details about unreleased products to be important trade secrets because a core part of the company's marketing is aimed at creating ""surprise and delight"" when new products are revealed at closely choreographed launch events. 
The lawsuit gives a peek into the secrecy conditions in which Apple designers and engineers produce new products: 
Some takeaways from the lawsuit: 
""Tens of thousands of Apple employees work tirelessly every day on new products, services and features in the hopes of delighting our customers and empowering them to change the world. Stealing ideas and confidential information undermines their efforts, hurting Apple and our customers,"" an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. ""We take very seriously this individual's deliberate theft of our trade secrets, violation of our ethics and our policies, all for personal gain.

Apple announced its new AirTag item trackers this week and sent me several to try out, so I'll show you what they're like.
The $29 AirTag ($99 for a pack of four) is a tiny metal tracker that you can attach to a keychain, drop in a bag or snap onto your luggage to keep track of those items. It's a lot like competing products from Tile, which has drawn that company's ire, but ties right into Apple's Find My app. It's the same app you can already use other Apple products like your iPhone, family members and friends, or, as of recently, devices made by a few third-party companies, too.
AirTag works by using a Bluetooth signal to tap into a network of about a billion Apple devices in the world, like iPhones and Macs, that also broadcast a Bluetooth signal. If you lose something with an AirTag attached to it, you'll get a notification with the location when someone with an iPhone or Mac comes within Bluetooth range of it. It'll also show anyone who finds the item a custom message and phone number, which you enter when you report it lost.
It's a smart product for Apple to launch. It'll help make customers more likely to keep buying iPhones if they've already got these things stuck to a bunch of items that they don't want to lose.
This is the AirTag. It's a quarter-sized tracker. It's glossy white on one side and metal on the other. Both sides scratch pretty easily. You can customize it with an emoji or letters before you buy one. It's water-resistant so you can splash it or accidentally drop it in a puddle without damaging it. I ran one under the sink and it still works.
There's a replaceable CR2032 battery, the sort of coin batteries that you might find in a wristwatch, that should last about a year. You'll get an alert before it dies and you can buy replacement batteries in grocery stores and pharmacies.
It took me about 20 seconds to set up an AirTag. You just pull out a little battery tab to put it in pairing mode, bring it near your iPhone running iOS 14.5 or newer, and then tap ""Connect"" on the pop-up box that appears on your phone. It's just like pairing AirPods.
Then you enter a name for the item you're tracking. There are some default suggestions like ""backpack"" and ""keys,"" but you can name it anything you want. After that, you'll just confirm you're registering it to your Apple ID — and it's all set.
Then you just attach the AirTag to the item you want to track -- you can stick it on a keychain, drop it in a backpack or bag or put it in your wallet or purse -- and you're ready to roll.
Once you're set up, you can track the location of any of your AirTags whenever you have an internet connection. Just open the ""Find My"" app on your iPhone or iPad, tap ""Items,"" and select the one you want to track.
If you lose an AirTagged item somewhere — maybe you left it in an airport or at the park — visit the item's page in the Find My app and tap ""Lost Mode."" There, you can add a custom message and phone number for anyone who finds it, and sign up to receive a notification when it's found. You can't turn on notifications unless you're out of its range — that's actually very helpful, since it tells you if the item is still nearby by blocking you from setting notifications.
If someone with an iPhone comes in range of the AirTag, they'll receive a notification an AirTagged item is nearby. But even if they don't pick it up, you'll still get an alert on your iPhone showing where the AirTag was at that moment.
I tried this by bringing my wife's iPhone near the AirTag, and I got a notification on my iPhone saying the AirTag was at my address.
This even works if someone with an Android device finds it, as long as the device has an NFC chip — and most modern devices do. I tested it by tapping it to the back of an Android phone, and the Android phone launched a web browser that showed my phone number and said the item was lost.
Some of you may have privacy concerns — what if somebody drops an AirTag in your bag to track you? Apple says it has thought about this. If an AirTag is separated from its owner and is traveling with someone else — say you're walking with one in your bag without realizing — it will begin to play an alert sound.
Once you discover it, you can tap an iPhone or any NFC-compatible Android device to the AirTag and get instructions on how to disable it. (You can remove the battery by pushing the back of the AirTag and twisting it counterclockwise.) There isn't a way to report abuse to Apple, but you can take it to law enforcement for help. You may need to provide police with the AirTag and/or the serial number which is tied to the owner's Apple ID.
If you have an iPhone 11 or later, you can use the built-in ultra wideband chip to find the exact location of an AirTag. That means your iPhone will direct you to the keys hiding in your sofa.
You just open the Find My app, tap ""Find Nearby"" and your iPhone will use a combination of sensors and cameras to direct you to the lost item. It will show you how far away something is and will display an arrow on the screen telling you which direction to walk.
Apple also includes a flashlight shortcut if you're hunting in the dark, and an audio option that will force the AirTag to emit loud beeps. It's loud enough that I could hear it from adjacent rooms in my house.
I think it's a great gadget to have if you're in Apple's ecosystem and use an iPhone. I plan to leave one on a pair of keys I keep losing, and I might put one in a small backpack in case I accidentally leave it somewhere like the park.
Just know that it doesn't necessarily prevent theft. Anyone who discovers an AirTag in an item they stole can just remove the battery or toss it somewhere else. Truly, it's best for recovering items that you lost or may be hanging around the house somewhere.
You can order them beginning Friday.

In this article
On Tuesday, Apple announced a long-awaited gadget called AirTag. Users can attach the $29 coin-sized device to valuables such as keys or a backpack, then, if the item gets lost, locate it on a live map inside Apple's built-in Find My software.
AirTag competes with a number of other products on the market, including from Tile, whose general counsel complained before Congress on Wednesday about Apple's overall dominance.
But AirTag's most important differentiating feature isn't the technology inside the $29 coin-sized stainless steel gadget. It's other people's iPhones.
AirTag doesn't have a GPS signal, which would rapidly drain its battery and raise privacy questions. Instead, when it's attached to a lost object, it sends out scrambled Bluetooth signals. For those signals to reach the internet and inform the person who's looking for their lost device, they'll need to find an iPhone that's listening for them.
""Using Bluetooth and the hundreds of millions of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS devices in active use around the world, the user can locate a missing device even if it can't connect to a Wi-Fi or cellular network,"" Apple explained in a security disclosure about the Find My service. ""Any iOS, iPadOS, or macOS device with 'offline finding' enabled in Find My settings can act as a 'finder device.'""
The product represents a new frontier for Apple: using its install base of over 1 billion iPhones as infrastructure to build services that its competitors can't. Now iPhones are part of a physical network out in the world that's looking out for stolen goods — even if their users have never purchased an AirTag.
""The bottom line is AirTag is an example of Apple leveraging its ecosystem to create a more compelling product than what is currently in the market,"" Loup Ventures founder Gene Munster wrote in a newsletter on Tuesday. ""Specifically, AirTag will have better navigation and discovery features, along with a billion-plus device network that can be utilized to help locate lost items.""
Enrolling in the Find My network does have benefits to iPhone users who don't buy AirTags. Many users sign up because the same app can be used to find lost Apple products, and it's easy to do when signing into an iCloud account on an iPhone.
The Find My network can be used to find an iPhone after it's been shut off, as thieves often do after stealing a phone. (If the device is on, it can be contacted through Find My iPhone, a similar service that uses the device's internet connection and predates the Find My network.)
Users can also opt out of the Find My network in Apple's settings, although that means they don't get the benefits of the network, such as finding devices that have been turned off or aren't connected to cellular or Bluetooth. (To do so, go to Settings > Your Name > Find My > Find My iPhone > and then toggle ""Find My network"" on or off.)
The number of devices participating in the network is crucial for a product such as AirTag.
Apple describes its Find My service as a ""vast, global network"" and allows third-party accessory makers to release products that use it, too.
If an AirTag is lost in the middle of a desert with no Apple devices in Bluetooth range, it can't connect to the internet to send signals or update the user's map. But in the middle of an American city, where an estimated 42% of people have iPhones — more in some areas — you're much more likely to find a device that's looking for your lost AirTag.
Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously described Apple's product strategy as ""only Apple,"" suggesting that because the company builds hardware, develops software and runs its own online services, it can introduce features that rivals such as Microsoft, Google and Samsung can't.
While Samsung and other major smartphone vendors have similar numbers of phones in people's hands, they don't control the underlying operating system, making features such as Find My much more difficult to implement widely at once.
For Apple, AirTag is probably an effort to add distinguishing features to its iPhone to discourage current users from switching to an Android device. It's not likely to be a major revenue driver.
""While the Airtags are incremental to our model we do not believe even a very successful launch of that product will have much impact on our forecasts given the low $29 price point,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall wrote in a note Tuesday.
If Apple becomes more skilled at using its installed devices as privacy-sensitive infrastructure, it could represent a durable advantage for the company. Apple's installed base of iPhones could become especially important as it invests heavily in augmented reality, a technology that merges the physical and digital worlds.
A network of location-aware iPhones could be used in augmented reality apps such as Pokemon Go, for example, to identify where other players are competing and start a group experience. It provides the sensors and internet connection needed for building digital experiences in the real world without building new equipment each time.
AirTag also represents a major test for Apple's privacy positioning.
Since 2015, Apple has advertised privacy and security as major differentiators for its iPhone. It has consistently built systems, such as Covid tracking exposure notifications, that are decentralized, which means they are designed in a way that data is processed and calculated on a device instead of on servers that Apple can access.
Apple is building on that reputation to assure customers that its Find My system won't leak user location or data when acting as a finding device. Apple says the Find My network keeps location data private and anonymous and that it doesn't store location data or history.
How Apple pulls it off is a matter of complicated software engineering. ""Find My is built on a foundation of advanced public key cryptography,"" Apple's security disclosure says.
Now Apple's users will need to decide whether they understand and trust the Find My network and Apple — both as users of them, and as iPhone users participating in them to make them work better.

Apple will allow controversial social media app Parler back onto the iPhone App Store, according to a letter released Monday by Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.
Apple removed the app in January after Parler was used to publicize the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot when the app's content featured calls for violence and other illegal activity.
Parler has updated its app and improved its content moderation, an Apple official wrote in the letter. As of April 14, Apple's App Review department had approved the changes and an updated version of Parler will be approved by Apple, the letter said.
""Apple anticipates that the updated Parler app will become available immediately upon Parler releasing it,"" Timothy Powderly, Apple's senior director for government affairs, wrote in the letter, which was addressed to Buck and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah.
Buck said in a tweet that the decision was a ""huge win for free speech."" The Parler app was not available for download on an iPhone on Monday morning, and a Parler representative said that the app would re-launch on Apple's App Store next week. 
""We have worked to put in place systems that will better detect unlawful speech and allow users to filter content undesirable to them, while maintaining our strict prohibition against content moderation based on viewpoint,"" Parler interim CEO Mark Meckler said in a statement. 
Parler is a social network that competes with companies such as Twitter and Facebook. It was initially advertised as a website and app with an emphasis on ""free speech"" and significantly less content moderation. It is popular with people who supported former President Donald Trump.
Apple said it removed Parler because the app violated Apple's app guidelines around violent content. Apple said it was not a permanent ban, only a suspension, and could be ""cured"" if Parler added moderation and removed violent content. Apple said in its letter that over 30,000 apps had been removed in 2020 for issues with objectionable user-generated content.
""And so, if they get their moderation together, they would be back on there,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Fox News in January.
Apple's App Store rules have been a focus of regulators and lawmakers who say that they raise competition concerns because the app store is the only way for most users to install software on an iPhone. Last week, Apple agreed to send a top executive to testify before the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust later this week.
Google also removed Parler from its Google Play store for Android phones, and Amazon pulled its web hosting contract, which has led to a lawsuit. Parler is still not available on Google Play.
Apple said it did not coordinate with the other companies to remove Parler.
""Apple made an independent decision to remove Parler for non-compliance with the guidelines, and it did not coordinate or otherwise consult with Google or Amazon with respect to that decision,"" Powderly wrote in the letter.

Apple released iOS 14.5, its big new software update for iPhones, on Monday.
The update adds a lot of new features, such as updates to Siri, Podcasts, Apple News and support for the latest game console controllers.
But the one that's been grabbing headlines is Apple's new privacy change, which gives users more transparency and control over apps that want to track them for advertising. Facebook in particular has been worried about the privacy change, as it could limit its ability to effectively target ads to iPhone users.
There are lots of other features, though. Here's an overview of what's new in iOS 14.5.
IOS 14.5 includes the App Tracking Transparency framework, which is expected to have major implications for the way mobile advertising operates.
You'll see a pop-up when you open an app that wants to access that your unique device ID for advertisers. That pop-up will ask if you want to be tracked and will show why the app wants you to opt in. For instance, an app might say you'll get a better ad experience if you allow tracking.
Many companies that rely on online advertising have said the privacy change will reduce the effectiveness and profitability of targeted ads. Facebook has waged a campaign against the change and appears set to lose revenue as a result of it. But it's not clear just how much. Analysts at MKM Partners said they believed in the second half of last year that Apple's changes would have more impact but as of last week expected a ""fairly fleeting and minimal fundamental impact on the ecosystem.""
Apple added this feature since its latest phones rely on Face ID, which doesn't work when you have a mask on. Now, you can set up your Apple Watch to unlock your iPhone when you're wearing a mask. Here's how to set it up:
Apple's Siri voice assistant no longer defaults to a female voice when you set up your iPhone. Instead, you'll be prompted to choose from one of four default voices when you boot up your new iPhone. It includes two new Black American voices in English, male and female, and a new male voice.
Siri will also now announce calls through AirPods or CarPlay while driving and let you speak to answer the call. This builds on an existing feature, which lets Siri read you your text messages through AirPods. You can set this up by doing this:
Siri will start to learn the music or podcast service you use most often and play your requests from that service. You still can't change the default from say, Apple Music to Spotify, but eventually, if you keep asking Siri to play music from Spotify with a command like, ""Hey Siri, play The Strokes on Spotify,"" it'll start to learn to play it there so you don't have to say the ""... on Spotify"" part.
Apple is also making changes to its Podcast and Apple News apps. Podcasts, which in May will support subscriptions to channels you want to pay for, has new cover art similar to Apple Music for the episodes you're listening to. It also has new Saved Episodes for listening later, new preferences for offline and syncing across devices such as Mac and iPad, so you can access downloaded episodes on other devices, and improved search functions.
Apple News has improved search, a redesigned Apple News+ tab that helps you manage magazines you've downloaded, and a new article search function for finding specific stories.
IOS 14.5 brings Bluetooth support for new Microsoft Xbox Series S/X and Sony PlayStation 5 controllers, which didn't previously work with iPhone. This means people with the new systems can play games with controller support on their iPhones and iPads. It's especially useful if you're playing Microsoft's Xbox Remote Play or its new Xbox Cloud Gaming service, the latter of which just started rolling out in beta on April 19.

Apple's 38% gross margin was about as certain as death and taxes. 
Until recently.
In its quarterly earnings report on Wednesday, Apple said that its gross margin — the percentage of revenue left after accounting for the cost of goods sold — jumped to 42.5%. In the prior period, the figure was 40%.
It's the highest margin for Apple since 2012, when the company was less than half its current size. Between 2013 and 2020, the number hovered between 37% and 39%, more often than not sitting right at 38%, according to FactSet.
Apple, the most valuable company in the U.S., is squeezing more profit out of its business by getting buyers of its iPhones and iPads to spend more money on services like iTunes, Apple Music, Apple Pay and App Store purchases. In reporting better-than-expected sales and earnings figures for the quarter, Apple said the services business jumped 27% from a year earlier, while its services gross margin expanded to 70% from 65% last year at this time and 64% a year before that.
Canaccord Genuity analysts said in a report last week that Apple should generate higher margins as users of its 1.65 billion active devices snap up add-on software products.
""This growing base should consume increasing Apple services, helping drive faster growth for this high-margin business than the overall hardware business,"" wrote the analysts, who recommend buying the stock.
Apple, which maintains a notoriously strong grip over its supply chain, is also getting stronger profits from its hardware sales. Its product margin jumped to 36% in the period from 30% a year earlier.
At least some of that increase comes from price hikes. The iPhone 12, which was announced in October, costs $100 more than the prior year's baseline model. Analysts at Wedbush said that average selling prices have also moved higher for the more expensive iPhone Pro and Pro Max versions.
While iPhone sales move through cycles, software and services are more reliable and have allowed Apple to find avenues for growth regardless whether people are upgrading their devices in any particular period. This month, the company announced a podcast subscription and said it's redesigning its podcast app.
Spotify, Apple's top rival in music and audio, followed this week by launching its own podcast subscription service. Spotify isn't taking a subscription revenue cut for the next two years as it tries to lure content developers, and said creators will receive 100% of their sales, excluding payment transaction fees. Starting in 2023, the company will charge a 5% fee for the tool. Apple takes a 30% cut the first year and will then drop the fee to 15% in the second year.
Apple shares rose as much as 3.6% in extended trading to $138.41 after the earnings report. The stock is about flat this year as of the close.

Some app makers who rely on mobile distribution from Apple and Google are scared of how much power the tech giants have over their businesses, according to congressional testimony delivered Wednesday.
""We're all afraid,"" Match Group Chief Legal Officer Jared Sine told Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., the chair of the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust, at a hearing.
The hearing brought together representatives from Apple and Google and several of their most outspoken critics, including Match Group, which owns dating site Tinder; Tile, which makes devices that help users find lost objects and faces new competition from Apple's AirTag technology, and streaming music service Spotify.
The hearing comes as lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are working on updates to the antitrust laws that could better account for the power a few tech giants hold over many digital markets. That includes the ability of platforms such as Apple and Google to manage the main distribution platform for apps while increasingly hawking their own competing products.
Throughout the hearing, the app makers expressed fear over how easily either company could undercut their businesses by making small changes to their app store rules. They also complained of high fees for in-app purchases and unclear enforcement of standards.
Multiple executives accused Apple and Google of threatening their businesses.
Sine said Google called Match Group on Tuesday night after his testimony became public to ask why his testimony differed from the company's comments in their latest earnings call.
On the earnings call, Match executives had said they believed they were having productive conversations about Google's 30% in-app payment fee through its Google Play store. But in testimony, Match complained that Google had made ""false pretenses of an open platform"" and complained about its ""monopoly power.""
Wilson White, Google's senior director of public policy and government relations, said it sounded like employees working in Google's business development team reached out to ask an ""honest question."" White said he didn't view it as a threat ""and we would never threaten our partners"" because Google needs app developers to use its app store in order for it to be successful.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the call was ""potentially actionable.""
Klobuchar said she planned to look into the matter further.
Spotify Chief Legal Officer Horacio Gutierrez said he could think of ""at least four clear examples of threats and retaliation"" from Apple after Spotify decided to speak out about alleged anticompetitive behavior and Apple's fees for developers on digital products purchased through its platform. That included threats of removing Spotify's app, refusing to promote it, or waiting for months for minor app updates to be approved, he said.
""They've basically thrown the book at us in order to make it hard for us to continue to sustain our decision to speak up,"" he said.
Many app makers have complained about the fees gatekeepers charge for in-app purchases for digital services.
Gutierrez complained of what he called Apple's ""gag order"" over how Spotify can communicate with its own users about how to upgrade to its paid version.
For instance, Spotify allows customers to upgrade only outside of its iOS app in order to avoid Apple's 15% to 30% commission fee on digital services purchased through its platform. But because Spotify doesn't sell the paid service through its iOS app, Apple also doesn't let the app maker talk about upgrades with customers through the app — instead, users have to upgrade through a web browser on a PC or another method.
At the same time, Apple operates a competing service, Apple Music, which has no such restrictions. Gutierrez said this gives Apple's version an unfair advantage.
Representatives from Apple and Google both told lawmakers that their fees for developers are meant to cover the costs that go into distributing apps through their platforms and securing them appropriately. Apple Chief Compliance Officer Kyle Andeer compared the services offered on the App Store today to the cumbersome and expensive process app makers had to pursue to distribute their apps before the App Store existed.
White cast the group as a set of ""small but vocal"" representatives of ""primarily large companies."" He said he worried that in trying to satisfy their complaints, ""we damage the very foundation that has allowed the Android open source ecosystem to work so well for a much larger set of small and medium-sized businesses.""
In addition to complaints about fees, developers worried that Apple's own rival products incentivized it to make unfavorable decisions toward them.
For example, Tile General Counsel Kirsten Daru said the company had asked Apple for permission to use ultra-wideband technology on iPhones to make its item-tracking technology more precise than it can be using only Bluetooth. She said Apple had refused the request, then reserved the technology for its own competitive AirTags, which it announced Tuesday.
While Apple is rolling out a way for third-party developers to build on the more precise location data, Daru said that in order to access that, ""we have to give Apple unprecedented control over our business and direct customers to the Find My app to find their lost items.""
Apple's Andeer argued AirTags is a separate product from Tile, which currently has the majority of the market share for the space, and that opening tools to more third-party developers will encourage competition.
App makers also complained that Apple's enforcement of its app store rules can appear arbitrary and delay the launch of key features. Apple may tell developers which rule they've violated but not exactly how or what to do to fix it, Sine said.
He said Tinder had tried to submit a version of its app with a feature aimed at protecting its LGBTQ+ users by notifying them when they were in a country where they could be at risk of exposing their sexuality or gender identity. Sine said that it took two months and a conversation between top executives of Match Group's owner, IAC, and Apple to sort out the issue.
An exchange between subcommittee ranking member Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Andeer revealed how complex Apple's App Store rules can be.
Lee asked Andeer to differentiate between why a paid service through Tinder might incur a commission while one for Uber would not. Andeer explained an Uber customer is paying for a non-digital service — a car to show up to their house — while they don't expect the same return from Tinder, saying that would be a different service, in what appeared to be an insinuation of sex work.
The app makers emphasized their reliance on the app stores because of their unprecedented access to consumers. But, they argued, it's not the symbiotic relationship that Apple and Google like to paint.
""We are not successful because of what Apple has done, we have been successful despite Apple's interference,"" Gutierrez said. ""And we would have been much more successful but for their anticompetitive behavior.""

Apple announced plans Monday to open a new campus in the Raleigh, North Carolina, area.
Apple will spend over $1 billion on the campus, and it will employ 3,000 people working on technology including software engineering and machine learning.
The campus is a sign of Apple's continued expansion beyond its headquarters in Cupertino, California, where most of its engineering has been based. Apple's $1 billion campus in Austin, Texas, is expected to open next year.
Apple's expansion will be located in North Carolina's Research Triangle area, which gets its name from nearby North Carolina State University, Duke University and the University of North Carolina. Apple CEO Tim Cook and COO Jeff Williams have MBAs from Duke. Apple senior vice president Eddy Cue, who is in charge of the company's online services, graduated from Duke.
""As a North-Carolina native, I'm thrilled Apple is expanding and creating new long-term job opportunities in the community I grew up in,"" Williams said in a statement.
Apple joins other Silicon Valley technology companies that are expanding outside the Bay Area to gain access to a wider pool of engineering talent and in response to high housing prices and other costs of living in the region.
For example, Oracle announced plans last year to move its headquarters to Austin, Texas. Mountain View-based Google is spending $1 billion on a new campus in New York City and is redeveloping a former shopping mall in Los Angeles. Amazon's second headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, has 1,600 employees out of a planned 25,000.
Apple also said Monday it was rapidly expanding in other cities where it has engineering operations. It plans to employ 5,000 people in San Diego, 3,000 people in Culver City in Los Angeles, and 700 in Boulder, Colorado, by 2026. Apple also said it employs 1,000 people in Seattle, and plans to double that. In total, Apple said it plans to add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. over the next five years.
Still, Apple will continue to be based in Silicon Valley, where it has about 25,000 employees, including 12,000 employees in its loop-shaped headquarters. Apple said last year it has 147,000 full-time employees, including retail workers.

A group of hackers named REvil has stolen and published product blueprints from Apple supplier Quanta Computer and is holding other blueprints under a $50 million ransom, Bloomberg reported Wednesday.
The hackers reportedly published design details for a new MacBook on Tuesday, when Apple was holding a product event for new devices including the iMac, iPad Pro and an updated Apple TV.
An Apple spokesperson wasn't immediately available to comment.
If the hackers have the files, it could mean that some of Apple's hardware plans may come to light before Apple is ready to announce those devices. Apple likely has many new devices in the works, from expected products such as new iPhones and computers to entire new device categories such as augmented reality glasses. Quanta Computer builds some of Apple's Mac products.
Quanta confirmed an attack to Bloomberg and said it's working with law enforcement. The company also said that there's no material impact on the company's business operation.
REvil reportedly claims that it has other product blueprints and that it will continue to publish photos and documents of future Apple devices daily unless Apple pays the $50 million ransom.

Apple just held its first product launch event of the year. It announced a new iMac that ships in seven colors, the new iPad Pro with an M1 chip and support for faster 5G networks, an AirTag lost-device tracking gadget and a refreshed Apple TV 4K with a brand-new remote.
Apple just held its first product launch event of the year, where it announced a colorful new iMac and an updated iPad Pro with 5G and the M1 chip that's also used in the company's desktop computers.
Apple also announced an AirTag lost-device tracking gadget and a refreshed Apple TV 4K with a brand-new remote.
Investors didn't appear to be impressed by the news. Shares of Apple were down about 2% after the product event wrapped up.
 Here are some of the highlight announcements, but scroll down to see more.
Apple said on Tuesday that it will release new high-end iPad Pros that use the company's M1 chip, which is also used in its Mac computers. Previously, iPads used A-series chips, which are what powers the company's iPhones. Apple says it is the most powerful tablet on the market.
It also includes an improved USB-C connector that will allow the iPad to connect to higher-resolution monitors and download images from a camera more quickly.
The 12.9-inch iPad Pro features an improved screen using an array of LEDs that is brighter and has better color resolution than previous displays using a technology called Mini-LED.
The iPad Pro will also have a 12-megapixel front-facing camera with an ultrawide lens that can automatically pan to keep human subjects in the shot.
Some models will include 5G support, Apple said. The 11-inch model starts at $799, and the 12.9-inch model costs $1,099. They will be available for preorder on April 30 and will ship in late May. — Kif Leswing
These iMacs are powered by Apple's custom M1 silicon, not Intel processors. The computers have a new, thinner aluminum design, and they come in red, blue, purple, orange, yellow, silver, and green. The new thinner design looks a lot like a big iPad.
Apple says the volume of the computer has been reduced by 50%, resulting in a smaller computer that can fit on a desk more easily. It comes with a 24-inch built-in display and an improved camera that can record 1080p video in low light. Apple says the display runs at ""4.5K"" resolution.
It ships with a new magnetic power connector reminiscent of Apple's previous MagSafe laptop chargers and a slightly updated keyboard with an emoji key and a fingerprint sensor. Apple's mouses and keyboard come in the same colors as the new iMacs.
The entry-level model costs $1,299, and an upgraded version costs $1,499. The new iMacs will go up for preorder on April 30 and will ship in the second half of May, Apple said.
Apple's first iMacs, released 20 years ago, also came in different colors.
Apple is finally rolling out a new, redesigned remote for the Apple TV. It's made of aluminum and has dedicated buttons for navigating menus, which should solve some of the headaches caused by the earlier remote. It will ship in the second half of May with the new Apple TV 4K, which costs $179 or $199 depending on the model.
— Jessica Bursztynsky
Apple announced that its Apple TV 4K box has been updated with a new processor, and it will be able to handle high frame rate HDR video which will result in displaying smoother, more colorful sports events.
It will also include a new feature that will use the iPhone's camera to tune the TV's picture quality.
It also comes with a completely redesigned remote made of aluminum with physical buttons, instead of the old remote's touchpad. It can also control your TV's power. Instead of a touchpad, it has a wheel for controlling the display.
It starts at $179 for 32GB of storage. It goes up for preorder on April 30 and will start shipping in the second half of May, Apple said. — Kif Leswing
Apple announced AirTag, calling it an iPhone accessory, priced at $29 for one or $99 for four. It will be on store shelves on April 30.
It uses Apple technology called Find My, which uses a network of iPhones to find lost objects. It's using a technique Apple calls ""precision finding"" that it says is privacy-sensitive.
This product has been the source of some scrutiny from lawmakers who have heard that Apple is privileging its own lost-item trackers over others' using anticompetitive practices and access to the iPhone operating system. Find My opened to third-party accessory makers last month. — Kif Leswing
It goes up for preorder on Friday and will ship on April 30. — Kif Leswing
Apple announced that it's launching its podcast subscription service next month, putting itself up further against Spotify and other competitors in the audio streaming wars.
The company is also redesigning its Apple Podcast app.

CEO Tim Cook said Apple will allow partners and spouses to share a credit line on a credit card, allowing both people to build credit scores. It's also introducing features for families and teenagers. Apple was notably under fire from co-founder Steve Wozniak after people discovered that sometimes spouses had different credit limits. — Kif Leswing
Walking around Apple Park, Apple's campus in Cupertino, California, Apple CEO Tim Cook kicked off the event with factoids about Apple's environmental efforts, saying that Apple is carbon-neutral and hopes to remove 1 million tons of carbon from the environment per year. — Kif Leswing
As Apple's event kicks off, YouTube shows more than 360,000 people are streaming it on that platform. Apple's three launch events last fall each garnered millions of people watching live on YouTube. It's also available streaming directly on Apple's website, which isn't counted in the YouTube numbers. — Kif Leswing
As Apple prepares to potentially release new iPads, remember that the product has had a great pandemic: In the fourth calendar quarter of 2020, Apple shipped $8.44 billion in iPads — which was up 41% year over year. — Kif Leswing
Apple is best known for its fall launch events, where it reveals new iPhones, but it's no stranger to hosting somewhat lower-profile events in the spring.
Apple didn't hold a spring event in 2020 due to the onset of the coronavirus pandemic and instead launched new iPads and other gadgets on its website. In 2019, Apple's spring announcement focused on services such as Apple TV+ and the Apple Card. But it also announced new iPads in 2018 during an education-focused event at a school in Chicago.
Last fall, Apple broadcast three prerecorded product launch events in three months, each of which garnered millions of live viewers on YouTube. — Kif Leswing
One of Apple's silliest traditions is that on the morning of an event it pulls its online Apple store down, giving up a few hours of online sales in exchange for building hype over its new products. Apple has done this for years, and technology has certainly gotten to the point where Apple could update its store without downtime — it does it all the time — but why mess with a tradition? — Kif Leswing
I wrote yesterday about some of the tensions bubbling under the surface at Apple. Yes, this is just another product event, but there are a lot of headaches on the horizon that could threaten its growth, especially in the App Store.
There's the war of words with Facebook over the impending iOS privacy feature. There's the upcoming trial with Epic Games that centers on Apple's control of the App Store. And then there's Apple's dependence on China, which is an obvious target for Apple critics. (Just ask Peter Thiel.)
Read all about it right here.
— Steve Kovach
Apple CEO Tim Cook is gearing up for Tuesday's ""Spring Loaded"" event, where the company is expected to announce new iPads and potentially a handful of other products. ""It's a beautiful spring morning for an #AppleEvent! See you soon,"" Cook tweeted.

If you bought a computer or a phone in the last five years, you know what a dongle is. They connect headphones to charging ports, laptops to TVs or card readers, and so on. Today, it's hard to do many everyday tech tasks without them, which makes dongles a big business. That's in large part due to Apple, which removed its headphone jack from the iPhone lineup and switched almost entirely to USB-C (now Thunderbolt 3) ports on its computers in 2016.
Apple, Belkin and other accessory companies have created a huge market for these dongles, which is estimated by Facts and Factors to bring in more than $25 billion by 2027. But with wireless tech constantly on the heels of adapters like these, companies that once made most of their money on dongles – Belkin CEO Steve Malony said around 70% of its business was once made from dongles – are investing in the future of device connections.

Apple's head of software, Craig Federighi, said in court on Wednesday that Apple is not pleased with the amount of harmful software, or malware, on its operating system for Mac computers, MacOS.
Federighi said the ability Apple gives users to install software from the internet on Mac computers is ""regularly exploited"" and that the iPhone's operating system, iOS, has a ""dramatically higher bar"" for customer protection.
""Today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don't find acceptable and that is much worse than iOS,"" Federighi testified in the Epic Games v. Apple trial.
The difference between iPhone and Mac security is important in the trial because Epic Games is seeking to force Apple to allow it to install alternative app stores, which are permitted on Mac computers, on iPhones.
Epic Games argues that Apple can easily apply Mac software installation policies and security mechanisms to iPhones, while Apple says its App Store review process and rules keep users secure.
On Wednesday, Federighi said that the user base of the Mac is about one-tenth the user base of the iPhone. Apple said in January that it had 1 billion active iPhone users.
""For iOS, we aspired to create something far more secure. All indications are that we have succeeded in doing so,"" Federighi said. He said that Apple found and removed about 130 different kinds of malware on Macs last year that had infected hundreds of thousands of user systems, compared with three kinds of malware that had infected iPhones.
""I have a couple family members who've gotten some malware on the Mac, but ultimately I think the Mac can be operated safely,"" Federighi said.
Federighi's admission was prompted by a question from Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, who will decide what action to take in the coming weeks or months. The trial is scheduled to end next Monday after three weeks.
Apple customers have long wondered if the company was considering merging its Mac desktops and iPad tablets, which run a version of iOS. Apple's latest Mac computer uses the same processor as its high-end iPads.
Federighi subsequently provided a metaphor that suggests that Apple still sees them as separate products. For example, software developers still use Macs because they can install development tools, such as Xcode, and access the guts of the computer — including installing unauthorized software.
""I think of it as the Mac is the car, you can take it off road if you want, you can drive wherever you want. As that comes as a driver, you've got to be trained, there's a certain level of responsibility to doing that. But that's what you wanted to buy, you wanted to buy a car,"" Federighi said. ""With iOS, you're able to create something where children, even infants, can operate an iOS device and be safe in doing so. Really different products.""
A recent report from Nokia cited by Federighi said that iOS devices accounted for 1.72% of mobile malware infections, compared with 26.64% for Android and 38.92% for Windows.
""Android still has a considerable malware problem,"" Federighi said. ""Something like 50 times the malware of iOS.""
Apple CEO Tim Cook is scheduled to testify in the trial on Friday.

GasBuddy, an app that helps users find and save money on gas, topped the Apple App Store on Wednesday, as some consumers across the East Coast continue to struggle to find fuel after a cyberattack on Colonial Pipeline.
The company's pipeline has served as a vital link between the Gulf Coast refiners and the Eastern Seaboard, but the company had to take its entire system offline Friday after it fell victim to a ransomware attack. Much of the system is still offline.
Now, consumers are flocking to grab gas before tanks run out. Sixty-five percent of stations in North Carolina are out of fuel, according to data from GasBuddy. In South Carolina and Georgia, 43% of stations are without fuel, and 44% of stations are dry in Virginia, according to AAA.
Gas prices have also surged because of the supply issues and fear of shortages. On average, Americans are paying $3.008 for a gallon of gas, up from $2.985 on Tuesday and $2.927 one week ago, AAA said earlier this week.
This has all led consumers to seek gas stations that have supply and potentially cheaper prices. That's where GasBuddy comes in.
Typically, social media and entertainment giants such as TikTok, Facebook and YouTube top the App Store's free apps charts. The rankings reflect the momentum in downloads of a certain app, not necessarily the total cumulative downloads.

Amazon is beefing up its network of connected devices to take on technologies like Apple's new AirTags.
Amazon announced Friday that it is partnering with Tile, a company that makes trackers for lost items, and Level, which makes smart locks, to use those devices to enhance its tracking network based on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technology.
The strength and number of devices on a given tracking network is key to its accuracy. That's part of the reason why many think Apple's tracking network will be so strong since it relies on more than 1 billion iPhones, iPads and Macs to help with lost item tracking.
Tile has also been vocal against Apple's entry into the lost-item tracking space, recently telling Congress that it and other app developers are ""afraid"" of Apple's policies for third-party apps and hardware accessories.
Amazon's partnership will allow it beef up its tracking network, called Sidewalk, by letting Tile and Level devices tap into the Bluetooth networks created by millions of its Echo products. Tile will start working with Amazon's network beginning June 14.
""Sidewalk is all about the next billion things that are going to get on the network,"" Amazon product boss Dave Limp told CNBC's ""TechCheck"" on Friday. ""Wi-Fi is constrained, mostly to your home, it just doesn't have the range to go into your backyard into the neighborhood. Cellular may be the future, but it's very expensive today. So Sidewalk kind of splits the difference between those two and allows us to put millions and billions of things on the edge of the network but do it in a secure way.""
Sidewalk rolled out late last year and is billed as a free network sharing service throughout neighborhoods that uses Echo devices as ""bridges"" to share a small fraction of a users' low-bandwidth Wi-Fi with devices like Echo devices and Ring cameras.
Limp said in a statement that Tile will work with Sidewalk by integrating compatible Echo devices to extend Tile's network coverage even further, in the effort to help users securely locate misplaced keys, wallets and other items.
Amazon said Sidewalk will also strengthen Tile's existing in-home finding experience with Alexa. Customers can say, ""Alexa, find my keys"" and their Tile tracker will start ringing from a coat pocket or from under the bed signaling where to find their lost item.
Amazon also said users with multiple Echo devices connected to Sidewalk will be able to find misplaced items around their homes even faster. Alexa can tell users which Echo device their Tiled item is closer to, whether it is the kitchen speaker or their bedroom speaker and the day and time it was last seen near that device.
Apple announced its Tile-like product, AirTags, last month. They work in a similar way with iOS devices like iPhones and iPads. Now, Tile will connect through a larger technology ecosystem, pitting Amazon and Apple against each other in a new front of connected devices.
Sidewalk's second partnership with Level allows users to control their locks in the Ring and Level apps without needing to be in Bluetooth range of their mobile device. Instead of relying on their mobile device's Bluetooth connection, a Level lock will be able to connect directly to a compatible Ring Video Doorbell Pro device using an Amazon Sidewalk Bluetooth connection shared only between their two devices.
This means that even if a user is across town, their Level lock will stay connected, creating further functionalities within the Ring app to see and speak with whomever is at the entryway and easily lock or unlock their front door.
Amazon said its new smart-lock Level features are rolling out through updates in the Ring and Level apps and will be available by the end of May.
In response to privacy concerns, Amazon last September released a detailed white paper outlining the steps it's taking to ensure that Sidewalk transmissions stay private and secure.
Amazon said Sidewalk is equipped with multiple layers of privacy and security and that data shared over its network is protected with three layers of encryption. It's only accessible by the devices consumers choose, and data is automatically deleted every 24 hours to protect privacy. Consumers can choose to opt out of the feature by updating their preference in the Ring or Alexa mobile apps.

Apple just gave the iMac its the first major redesign since 2012, and I've been testing one out for a week.
It's insanely thin. Like the 1999 iMac, it ships in a bunch of colors. But most notably, this the first time Apple's all-in-one desktop computer is using the same M1 chip as the iPad, following the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini, which received the processor last year.
It's a heck of a time to launch a new Mac. Apple's Mac sales have continued to grow through the pandemic and were up 70% year over year in its fiscal Q2 as people worked, learned and played at home. That growth may slow as people continue to get vaccinated and head back to our commutes (and our clunky work-issued computers), but the iMac is so nice it may help push Mac sales for people who still need a computer at home.
Here's what you need to know about it.
The iMac is just crazy, crazy thin. It's sort of like a giant iPad with a big bottom chin sitting on a metal stand. It's also surprisingly light, which means you can easily move it from room to room if you need to, so long as there's an outlet nearby.
I love the variety of colors. Apple sent me the blue model, which has a deeper hue on the back than the sort of sky blue below the display on the front. It really looks and feels as if Apple is trying to make this the Mac that people show off around their house again, and I think some people actually will.
The screen is another highlight. It's now 24 inches diagonally, a notable improvement from the 21.5-inch display on the model it replaces. It's also nice and sharp with a 4.5K resolution and support for HDR content, which more clearly shows the deep darks and bright parts of a movie or TV show. I used the iMac as a computer in my office and also as a TV in my bedroom. I liked that the screen was big enough that I could watch stuff from bed as I would on a TV.
The iMac is fast and all the apps I use for work and play are supported. Most people who are casually editing photos and videos will find there's enough power. Pros who want to edit and render video, however, will naturally gravitate toward Apple's Pro machines, since there isn't a big beefy graphics card in here. The same goes for games — you're fine playing games that are a few years old, or any of the popular iPad or iPhone games that run on M1, like everything in Apple Arcade. But don't expect to play something like Call of Duty: Warzone.
The speakers are also surprisingly good for how thin it is. I normally use a pair of $50 speakers on my desktop PC and this blows them away. There's also a headphone jack in case you ever want to add a different set of speakers, or you can always use Bluetooth to pair up with a headset or AirPods.
There are two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports on the back of the entry-level $1,299 model, and the $1,499 version I tested has an additional two USB 3 ports (this is true for all more expensive models, too). That was enough for me to drop a few cables on the back for charging my iPhone, AirPods and more at my desk, while also using one of the Thunderbolt ports to add a second display. If you want to avoid dongles, consider getting the model with the additional ports. Speaking of ports, the charger uses a magnet, though it's not branded MagSafe like the older MacBook and current iPhone 12 chargers. It's just a power port that's a bit safer since it'll pop out if you trip on the cable.
The new Magic Keyboard, which matches the color of the computer you buy (as does the mouse) can be configured with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor for $50 more. You should do that while buying the iMac. It's really convenient for making purchases (like you would on Apple's laptops), for logging in in a split second, or for sharing a computer. Each family member just registers their fingerprints and then they can tap it to log in to their account when they jump on the computer.
Finally, the camera quality is noticeably better. Apple's M1 chip offers better quality even compared with the 27-inch iMac it launched last summer, which uses the same camera hardware. It did a good job keeping my image clear and bright, even if the room was a little dark. But I'd love to see Apple add some of the smart tracking so that the camera could follow me around the room — if I'm pacing while talking to my editor over FaceTime. It's a feature Apple introduced in the new iPad Pros this year, so maybe that will make its way over in future models.
All of this comes together to form a really capable desktop computer for the price. But there are still a few things I think could be improved.
The thing that stands out to me most here is the lack of a touchscreen. Apple has said Macs serve one purpose and iPads serve another. But I think a touchscreen would work well here. If you're flipping through recipes, for example, you might want to touch the screen instead of using a mouse. Also, the iMac's M1 chip lets you run iPhone and iPad apps if they're supported by the developer. A lot of the ones you might want, like Netflix and YouTube TV (or any of Google's apps for that matter) aren't there. But many are designed to be used with touch. 
Maybe I'm crazy, but I'd love to see an option in macOS that lets you flip to the iPadOS for when you want to use it like a touchscreen, and then switch back to regular macOS when you don't. Imagine just walking up and tapping Netflix and tapping a TV show. (I'd like to see macOS on an iPad Pro, too.) I can dream.
It's kind of a bummer it doesn't have an older regular USB 2.0 port. I know it's old technology, but there are still tons of chargers and accessories that use that type without an adapter, including the Apple Watch.
I also wish the display supported more angles. You can adjust the vertical angle by tilting it back or forward, but you can't raise or lower the display or turn it left to right. It's just locked onto the stand. Normally this works fine, but if you have a shorter desk or sit up higher on your chair, you might want to know you can't really adjust it to match your height unless you prop it up on some books.
My guess is most people are going to use the iMac with just the built-in screen, since it's pretty big. But the M1 chip only supports one additional monitor, the same as with the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini. So if you're like me and normally use three separate displays, you're going to be limited. I found I was able to get up to three screens by using an iPad Pro with the Side Car app, however. But you won't get three big screens over HDMI or Thunderbolt.
Lastly, it has a big chin under the screen. It doesn't bug me at all, but I think people who are used to big screens without much of a border might find it a turn-off. That's just a personal preference thing.
The new iMac is a fantastic desktop computer and worth buying if you need a desktop computer for you or the family. It will make a great home school computer for your kids, or an office desktop. 
But I also think you should consider buying a MacBook Air, my current favorite computer on the market given its power, battery life and price. Then, you can add a big screen at your desk, like this $400 one from LG, or something more expensive like this from Dell, and just plug the Air in when you want a big, bright display.
The catch is that a quality 4K display with the colors, brightness and accuracy of the iMac is going to set you back several hundred dollars or more. You'll also miss out on the good built-in speakers, added ports and webcam. But you gain portability, since you can take your MacBook Air everywhere you go.
It's a toss-up, but worth considering both options if you're shopping for a new computer now.
Overall, I think Apple has a winner here with an all-around solid computer that checks most boxes for most people. I can't help but wonder how many of these Apple would have sold if it launched at the beginning of the pandemic.

Snap CEO Evan Spiegel on Friday said the social media company is happy to pay Apple's 30% commission rate on in-app transactions.
""We really feel like Snapchat wouldn't exist without the iPhone and without the amazing platform that Apple has created,"" Spiegel said on TechCheck. ""In that sense, I'm not sure we have a choice about paying the 30% fee, and of course, we're happy to do it in exchange for all of the amazing technology that they provide to us in terms of the software but also in terms of their hardware advancements.""
Spiegel's comments come in stark contrast to those of business mogul Barry Diller, who ripped into Apple on Friday for the cut it takes of in-app transactions, saying his companies are ""overcharged in a disgusting manner"" by Apple.
""The idea that they actually justify it by saying, 'We spend all this money protecting our little App Store,'"" Diller said. ""I mean, it's criminal. Well, it will be criminal.""
Diller's comments came on the same day that Apple CEO Tim Cook is testifying in an antirust case focused on the App Store brought by Epic Games, which makes the widely popular video game Fortnite.
Spiegel, however, said Apple has been a great partner for Snap. Spiegel also praised Apple's decision to make changes in the company's latest version of iOS to provide users with more privacy protections.
""We're really aligned with them on the changes they're making to help protect privacy,"" Spiegel said. ""And so far, the early investments we made starting almost 10 years ago to protect user privacy on our platform are really paying off.""
As for how those privacy changes are impacting Snap's advertising business, Spiegel said the company has been working to help its advertising clients migrate onto Apple's SKAdNetwork, which is used by the iPhone maker to help advertisers measure the efficacy of their ads.
""So far, that transition has gone smoothly for our business,"" Spiegel said.
His comments come a day after Snap acquired British company WaveOptics for $500 million and after the company's annual Snap Partner Summit. There, Snap announced a new version of its Spectacles augmented-reality glasses, new e-commerce features and a new tipping feature for creators to make money.

Apple is planning to release redesigned MacBook Pro laptops with an updated version of its in-house processor sometime this summer, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.
The update will be followed by new versions of the MacBook Air, the Mac Pro desktop and the entry-level MacBook Pro, likely later in the year, the report said.
It shows how Apple is quickly working to capitalize on using its own chips after announcing last year it would transition away from Intel processors. The Apple M1 processor made its debut in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and Mac Mini last year and is also used in the new iMac, which launched this spring. The computers will reportedly use newer and more powerful versions of Apple's processor.
Apple's MacBook customers seem to like the new chip so far. Paired with the at-home work environment of the pandemic and a crop of new M1 computers, Apple's fiscal Q2 Mac revenue jumped 70.1% year over year from $6.86 billion to $9.1 billion. Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC last month that he expects the business to continue to perform well, even after people return to office work.
The new MacBook Pro will look different from the current model, according to the report. Its design has been relatively unchanged for the last several years.
Apple will add a 14-inch screen, replacing the 13-inch one on the current models, and features such as MagSafe, according to the report. MagSafe, which snaps the charger into the side of the laptop and prevents tripping over the wire since it pops out easily, was last used in the 2017 MacBook Air.
It will also include some ports professional users miss from earlier versions, such as an SD card slot for cameras and an HDMI port for easily attaching the computer to another display or a TV, the report said.
An Apple representative was not immediately available to comment on the report.

On Monday, former Apple marketing senior vice president and current Apple fellow Phil Schiller testified that Apple does reduce its App Store fees for certain companies from 30% to 15% in exchange for them supporting Apple's TV app.
Schiller was testifying as part of a lawsuit by Fortnite maker Epic Games that is asking a judge to force Apple to allow Epic to install its own app store on iPhones and bypass Apple's 30% App Store fee.
Schiller said that a few years back, the Apple TV department was working on a way to gather video streams from various apps and integrate them all into one experience for users.
The result was the Apple Video Partner Program, which allows members to take 85% of sales they make through in-app purchases, instead of paying Apple's typical 30% fee.
""The Apple TV team had a meeting with premium content providers and described the work they were going to do to integrate this new experience. For example, they had to integrate with our Siri voice assistant so we can find any show across any one of those app experiences,"" Schiller said. ""In talking with those developers, the Apple TV team asked if we could lower the commission to 85/15, not in the second year, but in the first year"" to allow them to recoup the engineering costs of supporting the Apple features.
Apple charges developers who are not part of the video partner program 15% in the second year of a subscription billed through Apple's in-app purchases. Schiller said that any company could get the 15% cut if they join the program and do the engineering work to integrate with Apple's TV app. It's not only available to large media companies, Schiller said.
Schiller also said that the program allowed participants to charge users directly, without using Apple's in-app purchase feature.
""When working with a number of these partners, in particular, the cable providers that are going digital, they had existing movie rental businesses installed as customers. And they asked if they could maintain those existing relationships,"" Schiller said, adding that Amazon is one of the companies in the program.
Much of Schiller's testimony on Monday emphasized how much Apple invests in its developer community to maintain a competitive edge against competing app stores. Schiller said that Apple spends about $50 million per year to hold its annual developers conference and that it is building facilities for outside developers at its headquarters.
Apple started to call its own witnesses, including Schiller, on Monday, and the trial is expected to run through next Monday. Schiller hasn't been questioned by Epic Games lawyers yet.
Apple and its CEO, Tim Cook, have consistently said that they treat every iPhone developer the same — the same rules for its App Store, the same commissions and the same review process.
Last year, the House Antitrust subcommittee published an email showing Apple online services senior vice president Eddy Cue sending an email to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in 2016 about the program.
""Here are the details of what we discussed on Prime Video — Amazon Prime Video app in iOS and Apple TV — 15% rev share for customers that signup using the app (uses our payment); no rev share for customers that already subscribe,"" Cue wrote.
Apple's Premium Video Partner Program was widely reported in April 2020, when the Amazon Prime Video app for iPhones and Apple TV boxes was discovered to be able to charge existing Amazon customers for rentals directly through credit card data it already had — a practice that is usually banned on Apple's App Store, including for Fortnite.
An Apple spokesman said when it was first reported that it was an established program exclusively for ""premium subscription video entertainment"" providers including Amazon, Altice and Canal that supported Apple features such as the Apple TV app, AirPlay 2, Siri and Apple's universal search and wanted to bill their existing customers.
An internal Apple slide deck published as part of the Epic Games trial this month showed Apple employees debating whether to offer ""video partner program benefits"" to Netflix in 2018 when the video streamer was considering whether to discontinue using Apple's in-app purchase software.
A page on Apple's website says the Apple Video Partner Program has existed since 2016 and has 130 participants, including Disney+, HBO Max and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
When the Premium Video Partner Program was first reported, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney told CNBC in response to the news, in a preview of its lawsuit: ""Epic Games wholeheartedly supports smartphone platforms and their digital stores opening up to payment processing competition.""

Epic Games argued that Apple purposely locks in its customers in the first day of a landmark trial with Apple over the rules of the App Store.
Epic is looking to force Apple to open up iPhone software distribution so it could use its own payment processor, bypassing Apple's customary 30% fee on digital goods. A favorable ruling could even allow Epic to offer its own app store for iPhones.
Apple is arguing that it built the App Store and gets to set the rules, which are designed to ensure that apps are high quality and secure.
""Epic wants us to be Android, but we don't want to be. And our consumers don't want that either. They want the choice,"" Apple lawyer Karen Dunn said.
Epic's argument is that Apple's App Store is anti-competitive, and that its arguments about quality and security are essentially an excuse to exclude competitors like Epic Games' title Fortnite, which was booted from Apple's store last year after it introduced a direct payment mechanism.
On Monday, Apple's and Epic's lawyers both made their opening statements, and Epic Games founder and CEO Tim Sweeney testified. The trial is expected to last three weeks.
A core part of the debate centers around the relevant market that Apple allegedly dominates.
Epic is arguing that the relevant market is iPhone app distribution. Apple says it is game distribution, and that users can easily switch to other phones and game consoles.
To bolster its definition, Epic is trying to show how Apple works to lock users into its products, making it more difficult to switch to Android or other platforms. On Monday, Epic lawyers cited several internal Apple documents, some over a decade old, while arguing that Apple executives built a ""walled garden"" brick by brick.
""Getting customers using our stores (iTunes, App, and iBookstore) is one of the best things we can do to get people hooked into the ecosystem,"" Eddy Cue, current Apple online services senior vice president, wrote to Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2013, according to an email revealed by Epic Games.
""Who leaves Apple products once they've bought apps, music, movies, etc!"" Cue concluded.
In another exchange, Apple executives discussed in 2013 whether releasing a version of iMessage for Android would make it easier to switch phone brands. iMessage is still exclusive to Apple products.
""I am concerned that the iMessage on Android would simply serve to remove and obstacle to iPhone families giving their kids Android phones,"" Craig Federighi, Apple software senior vice president, wrote in 2013.
In 2016, a customer emailed Apple saying that iMessage amounts to ""serious lock-in."" As part of an internal conversation about that email, Apple's current head of marketing, Greg Joswiak, wrote to colleagues, ""we hear this a lot.""
Most recently, Federighi wrote to Cook about Apple's sign-in feature which enables users to log into apps with an Apple login, saying that the feature is likely to ""make our platform more sticky"" in 2019.
Epic also argued that Apple doesn't need the App Store approval process to keep iPhone users safe. Epic contended that because Apple has sometimes approved low-quality apps for the store, its approval process is ineffective and doesn't protect user security.
In an email produced as part of proceedings, former Apple marketing boss Phil Schiller wrote in 2012 ""Is no one minding the store? This is insane!!!!!!!"" in response to a report of an ""obvious rip off"" app becoming the top free app on Apple's platform.
In Apple's opening statement, it emphasized that its rules have helped created a vibrant ecosystem that benefits iPhone developers, with more than 1.8 million apps in the App Store.
Apple said that Epic made $750 million from the App Store, arguing that the trial is merely about money and that Epic planned this lawsuit and a related marketing campaign in order to use Apple's technology without paying. Apple also said that Epic was looking at the wrong market and cannot show anti-competitive conduct in the gaming market — users can switch to Android, Microsoft Xbox or Sony Playstation.
Apple also defended its ""walled garden"" without using those terms, citing its App Review department that manually reviews and approves apps and filters out ""obviously malicious apps."" It said that based on its research, iOS represents only 2% of malware infections among all computing platforms.
""Take away from the security particular to the iPhones and the bad actors have a field day. This is why Android security statistics are so much worse,"" Dunn said.
""We thought about the fact that the iPhone is a phone that you're carrying around, you need it to work for you as a phone, and we cared deeply about the security of that device so it would be more protected and more reliable than PCs were at the time,"" Apple cited Schiller saying.
That's why Apple doesn't allow ""sideloading,"" or manual installation of apps, like Android does, Apple argued. If Epic wins, Apple contended, it would mean a less secure iPhone operating system.
In its opening argument, Epic lawyers said that Apple's App Store generates large profits, with operating margins of 78% in 2019 and 75% in 2018.
Epic cited Ned Barnes, one of its expert witnesses, who says he used internal Apple documents to come up with the calculation.
The profitability of Apple's App Store will be part of Epic's argument that Apple uses its market power to extract excess fees from software developers.
""We have documents, long detailed PowerPoints prepared for Apple's senior executive team that lay out the profitability of the App Store in regular presentations given multiple years in a row,"" Epic lawyer Katherine Forrest said.
Apple disputes the accuracy of the number and has said that the company doesn't look at profit and loss for specific units, instead looking at Apple's financials on a higher level.
""They're going to pull documents out of context in this case. This is incredibly misleading,"" said Apple lawyer Dunn. She said in court Monday that Apple doesn't internally allocate to the App Store the costs of building the technology for the store, and that the company has an integrated business model.
""Apple is concerned that analysts, investors, reporters, and others in the marketplace could misinterpret the public disclosure of non-public, unaudited financial information,"" Apple lawyers previously wrote in a court filing.
Apple's App Store is part of Apple's services business, which executives have highlighted to investors as a source of growth. Apple reported $53.77 billion in sales in its services line in its fiscal 2020 with a 66% gross margin (its fiscal year ended Sept. 26, 2020). Apple's services sales also includes subscriptions like Apple Music, AppleCare warranties and licensing fees in addition to the App Store.

Apple said Wednesday that its App Store facilitated an estimated $643 billion in billings and sales during 2020, according to a new study commissioned by the company.
The figure marks a 24% increase from last year, as the Covid-19 pandemic pushed many consumers toward their phones and tablets.
The latest figures come as Apple faces increased scrutiny over how it profits from in-app purchases. Apple takes a cut of between 15% and 30% from purchases of software or digital goods from apps distributed through the App Store.
Developers have alleged that Apple's App Store platform is unfair to smaller companies. Most recently, Epic Games sued Apple and argued in court that the company's App Store is anti-competitive.
Apple has denied the allegations and has said it ""does not have a dominant market share in any category where we do business"" and recently cut its App Store commissions to 15% for smaller companies. In response to the suit, Apple is arguing that it built the App Store and gets to set the rules, which are designed to ensure that apps are high quality and secure.
The study from the Analysis Group includes both transactions that Apple handles, including paid apps and in-app purchases, as well as purchases and other economic activity that happened through apps where Apple wasn't directly involved, such as sales of ads in apps. The report said that about 90% of total billings and sales facilitated by the App Store ecosystem in 2020 occurred outside of the App Store, meaning that Apple collected no commission on those sales.
The report also comes ahead of Apple's annual developers conference, WWDC, and highlights the company's work with small businesses. Wednesday's announcement suggests there's a lot of money to make from apps, and is likely an effort to continue to attract people to build new services around Apple products.
According to the study, the $643 billion generated through iPhone and iPad apps in 2020 is made up of:

Embattled Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily said Wednesday it will cease operations from midnight — just hours after police arrested another employee for allegedly breaching a controversial national security law.
The pressure on Apple Daily leading up to its closure has raised concerns over press freedom in Hong Kong — a semi-autonomous region under Chinese rule.
It comes on the heels of the national security law that came into force last year, which Beijing says is aimed at prohibiting secession, subversion of state power, terrorism activities and foreign interference.
Apple Daily said in a statement that its last print edition will be published on Thursday, and its website will not be updated from midnight. Earlier, the newspaper's publisher, Next Digital, said in a separate statement that the publication will shut down no later than Saturday due to ""current circumstances prevailing in Hong Kong.""
The newspaper has come under increasing pressure since its owner, media tycoon Jimmy Lai who is a strong critic of the Chinese central government, was arrested last year under the national security law. Lai is now in jail and some of his assets were frozen.
An advisor to Lai told Reuters on Monday that the newspaper will be forced to shut ""in a matter of days"" after authorities froze the company's assets under the security law.
Last week, around 500 police officers raided the newspaper's offices while some executives and staff were arrested on suspicion of colluding with a foreign country.
U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said following the raid that Washington was ""deeply concerned by Hong Kong authorities' selective use of the national security law to arbitrarily target independent media organizations.""
Hong Kong is a former British colony that returned to Chinese rule in 1997. At the time, China agreed to govern the city under a ""one country, two systems"" framework that would allow the Hong Kong people limited election rights and a largely separate legal and economic system.
The national security law in Hong Kong was implemented by Beijing last year without going through the semi-autonomous region's legislature.
Critics of China — who include pro-democracy activists and some governments such as that of the U.S. and the U.K. — have accused Beijing of undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.

During its developer event on Monday, Apple announced that anyone — including Android and Windows users — will soon be able to join FaceTime calls.
The feature, which will roll out this fall, could help Apple keep customers from defecting to competing video chat apps such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams when they need to video chat with friends and colleagues who aren't on an Apple device.
Apple isn't launching an Android FaceTime app, though. Instead, it will let you schedule and share FaceTime calls using a unique web link. Once someone receives that link, whether on Windows or Android, they'll be able to jump in and participate in the call. Apple said it's still end-to-end encrypted so it's still private.
People who want to join a FaceTime call just need to be running the latest version of Google's Chrome or Microsoft's Edge web browser, according to Apple's website.
People will still need an Apple device to start the call, or to partake in some of the new features Apple announced for FaceTime on Monday, such as watching a movie together or listening to music, which may require specific Apple apps depending on what you're trying to do.

Apple unveiled new versions of its operating systems on Monday which showed that the company's focus on privacy has taken a new turn. It's not just a corporate ideal or a marketing point anymore. It's now a major initiative across Apple distinguishing its products from Android and Windows competition.
Apple has positioned itself as the most privacy-sensitive big technology company since Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote an open letter on the topic in 2014. Since then, Apple has introduced new iPhone features that restrict app access to personal data and advertised privacy heavily in television ads.
But Monday's announcements showed that Apple's privacy strategy is now part of its products: Privacy was mentioned as part of nearly every new feature, and got stage time of its own.
Privacy-focused features and apps announced by Apple on Monday for forthcoming operating systems iOS 15 or MacOS Monterey included:
With its focus on privacy, Apple is leaning on one of its core strengths. Increasingly, data is being processed on local devices, like a computer or phone, instead of being sent back to big servers to analyze. This is both more private, because the data doesn't live on a server, and potentially faster from an engineering standpoint.

Apple's new privacy feature, designed to mask users' internet browsing, won't be available in China
Because Apple designs both the iPhone and processors that offer heavy-duty processing power at low energy usage, it's best poised to offer an alternative vision to Android developer Google which has essentially built its business around internet services.
This engineering distinction has resulted in several new apps and features that do significantly more processing on the phone instead of in the cloud, including:
Apple's privacy infrastructure also allows it to expand into big new markets like online payments, identity, and health, both from a product and marketing perspective.
It can build new products while being sure that it's following best practices for not collecting unnecessary data or violating policies like Europe's strict General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
In addition, users may feel more comfortable about features that deal with sensitive data or topics — like finance or health — because they trust Apple and its approach to data.
Features introduced by Apple on Monday show how the company is using its user data position to break into these lucrative markets.
Cook has said ""privacy is a fundamental human right"" and that the company's policies and his personal stance doesn't have to do with commerce or Apple's products.
But being the big technology company that takes data issues seriously could end up being lucrative and allow Apple more freedom to launch new services and products. Facebook, Apple's Silicon Valley neighbor and vocal Apple critic, has increasingly dealt with challenges launching new products because of the company's poor reputation on how it handles user data.
Americans also say that privacy is factoring into buying decisions. A Pew study from 2020 said that 52% of Americans decided not to use a product or service because of concerns over data protection.

The struggles for Apple shares in 2021 have set the stage for a boost from the new iPhone, but investors should wait for a lower stock price before jumping in, according to investment firm Bernstein.
Apple typically unveils its new iPhone models in the fall, and the stock has historically risen into that event, according to the firm. Shares retreated slightly this year and finished last week at just above $130.
Bernstein's Toni Sacconaghi, who has a market perform rating on the stock, said in a note to clients Monday that the underperformance makes Apple more tempting, but the price still isn't quite right.

Hong Kong pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily will be forced to shut ""in a matter of days"" after authorities froze the company's assets under a national security law, an advisor to jailed owner Jimmy Lai told Reuters on Monday.
The closure of Apple Daily would undermine the former British colony's reputation as an open and free society and send a warning to other companies that could be accused of colluding with a foreign country, media advocacy groups said.
Next Digital, publisher of the top-selling 26-year-old newspaper, would hold a board meeting on Monday to discuss how to move forward after its lines of credit were frozen, the adviser, Mark Simon, said.
""Vendors tried to put money into our accounts and were rejected,"" he said by phone from the United States.
""We thought we'd be able to make it to the end of the month. It's just getting harder and harder. It's essentially a matter of days.""
Apple Daily said on Sunday the freezing of its assets had left the liberal newspaper with cash for ""a few weeks"" for normal operations.
Chief Editor Ryan Law, 47, and Chief Executive Cheung Kim-hung, 59, were denied bail on Saturday after being charged with collusion with a foreign country.
Three other executives were also arrested on Thursday when 500 police officers raided the newspaper's offices, drawing condemnation from Western nations, global rights groups and the U.N. spokesperson for human rights.
Those three are still under investigation but were released from police detention.
Hong Kong and Chinese officials said press freedom cannot be used as a ""shield"" for those who commit crimes, and slammed the criticism as ""meddling.""
In May, Reuters reported exclusively that Hong Kong's security chief had sent letters to tycoon Lai and branches of HSBC and Citibank threatening up to seven years' jail for any dealings with the billionaire's accounts in the city.
A Hong Kong-based spokesperson for Citibank said at the time the bank did not comment on individual client accounts. HSBC declined to comment.
Authorities are also prosecuting three companies related to Apple Daily for alleged collusion with a foreign country and have frozen HK$18 million ($2.3 million) of their assets.
Simon told Reuters it had now become impossible to conduct banking operations in the global financial hub.
""We can't bank. Some vendors tried to do that as a favour ... and it was rejected.""
The newspaper has come under increasing pressure since owner and Beijing critic Lai, who is now in jail, was arrested under the national security law last August and has since had some of his assets frozen.
Apple Daily plans to ask the government's Security Bureau to unfreeze the assets on Monday and failing that attempt, it may look to challenge the decision in court.
Simon said some reporters had received threatening phone calls from unknown sources.
""Our staff are now just worried about personal safety,"" he said.
Police have said dozens of Apple Daily articles were suspected of violating the national security law, the first case in which authorities have cited media articles as potentially violating the legislation.
Simon said that based on his understanding from officers' questioning of the executives, around 100 articles were under scrutiny.
""After all this is said and done, the business community is going to look up and recognise that a man's company was gutted and stolen by a communist regime in Hong Kong,"" he said.
""That's a big deal.""

Apple adds 2-week work-from-anywhere benefit to hybrid office return—will it catch on?,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/04/apple-adds-2-week-work-from-anywhere-benefit-to-hybrid-schedule.html,"Fri, 04 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNBC,"
Apple will have employees return to office buildings three days a week, with the option to work remotely twice a week, beginning in September, the Verge reports.
In a letter to employees this week, CEO Tim Cook outlined plans to have workers back in the office by fall on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays, and those with manager approval can work remotely on Wednesdays and Fridays each week. Some teams that require in-person work will be onsite four to five days a week.
The tech giant's new remote-work policies are more rigid than some of its biggest competitors.
Microsoft employees have been notified they can continue to work from home half the time, or full-time with manager approval. Last summer, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg estimated half of the organization will continue to work remotely over the next five to 10 years. Meanwhile, Twitter continues to stand out for its May 2020 announcement that employees can work from home ""forever.""
Kate Lister, president of the research and consulting firm Global Workplace Analytics, says Apple's announcement specifying in-office and remote days strikes her as ""a bit odd, not in terms of the frequency of remote work, but in the fact that they are specifying the in-office days as Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday on a companywide basis.""
Google also recently announced plans to bring employees together three times a week, but leaves it to teams to decide on which days, and says up to 20% of its workforce will be able to telecommute permanently.
Lister sees some benefits of Apple's move, such as helping to take the guesswork out of knowing when colleagues will be on-site, to predict when resources such as janitorial or food services will be needed, to increase cross-team brainstorms, and to help employees arrange caregiving needs.
But she says limiting employee autonomy could lead people to quit. According to one May survey of 1,000 U.S. adults, 39% would consider quitting if their employers weren't flexible about remote work moving forward.
Even some of Lister's clients who have yet to announce their future hybrid plans are already losing talent to employers that are being upfront and transparent about permanent remote work — especially among tech companies in pricey cities.
Limiting remote work and recruiting opportunities could also negatively impact the future of Apple's products and services: ""It does not afford Apple the benefit of a broader talent pool and the diversity of thought that comes from being able to hire the best and the brightest regardless of where they work,"" Lister says.
Apple did not immediately respond to CNBC Make It's request for comment.
Apple also announced it will allow employees to work from anywhere for up to two weeks per year, ""to be closer to family and loved ones, find a change of scenery, manage unexpected travel, or a different reason all your own,"" according to the memo.
For other companies considering the move, a work-from-anywhere perk could be an attractive bonus to flexible work, but ""if that's all they're offering and not in addition to being able to work from home on some weekdays, I'd say don't even bother,"" Lister says.
Offering a limited work-from-anywhere option could be a compromise to encourage employees to stay in a city where their employer is located, or return if they've moved away in the last year. Local tax, employment and compliance laws make it difficult for companies to operate on a fully work-from-anywhere model.
But noting that many people already find it difficult to disconnect from work during their paid time off, Lister refers to the flex-time perk as a ""working vacation"" that Americans are already accustomed to: ""I don't think it'll add too much to attraction and retention efforts.""

After Microsoft executives showed the biggest changes coming in Windows 11, CEO Satya Nadella took the stage and tried to explain how the new operating system enables Microsoft to be different from another company with a popular operating system: Apple.
""Today the world needs a more open platform, one that allows apps to become platforms in their own right,"" he said.
The comments come after Apple has faced legal pressure and complaints from companies for its control over how developers can earn money through the App Store.
Among other things, Apple restricts app makers from presenting anything that appears like a competitive store — such as an app that contains links to download multiple apps. Last year, Apple prevented Microsoft from delivering a single app where people could get access to play cloud-based video games on iOS. Microsoft already offers a similar app for Google's Android mobile platform.
Apple has also taken a 30% cut of all follow-on sales — such as subscriptions or in-game purchases — from any app that users download through its App Store. (It recently reduced its cut to 15% for small developers with annual revenues under $1 million.)
With Windows 11, Microsoft is ""introducing new store commerce models and policies and creating new opportunities for local publishers,"" Nadella said.
The company is giving third-party developers an option to use a non-Microsoft commerce platform in their apps and not have to share any of their revenue with Microsoft.
End-users can also download apps and games through non-Microsoft app stores, from companies such as Epic Games and Valve Software.
""Windows recognizes that there is no personal computing without personal agency,"" Nadella said. ""Personal computing requires choice. And we need to nurture and grow our own agency over computing itself. We want to remove the barriers that too often exist today and provide choice and connection.""
The company is adding its Teams chat and video calling app into Windows 11, and that app works across iOS, Android, Mac, the web and Linux. Historically, Apple has been more selective about availability of its Messages and FaceTime apps, although the iPhone maker said earlier this month FaceTime is coming to Android and Windows in the fall.
In the past Apple has received pushback for promoting its own applications on its operating systems. Microsoft does that, too. But now, as Microsoft makes it possible for anyone to download Android apps in Windows 11, the company is giving people a wider selection to choose from.

Apple rolled out a really cool new Dolby Atmos surround sound feature to Apple Music this week that might help it attract and keep subscribers as it competes with streaming music leader Spotify.
Dolby Atmos spatial audio makes it feel a bit more like music is surrounding you while using headphones, instead of just piping into your left and right ears. Songs with Dolby Atmos are available for free, so long as you're already an Apple Music subscriber. Dolby Atmos is also available through Amazon Music HD and TIDAL subscriptions, while Deezer uses Sony's competing version, 360 Reality Audio, for its Deezer HiFi service. Spotify doesn't yet have a Dolby Atmos option.
I'm not an audiophile, and I can't usually tell the difference between some of the higher-quality tracks music services have started to roll out. But there's a noticeable difference between regular stereo music and these new ""Spatial Audio with support for Dolby Atmos"" songs. At least, most of the time. The difference is more noticeable in some songs than others.
There are only thousands of tracks, out of the 75 million in Apple Music, with support for it right now, but Apple has some playlists that can show you what it's capable of. And new albums will continue to add support while artists rework some older songs, too. 
It's probably not enough alone to get people to subscribe to Apple Music — at least not yet — but it's a nice added benefit for people who already have Apple Music to get more out of the service.
Normally, when you listen to a song through headphones, you're listening to stereo sound. It's like when you have two speakers on the left and right of your TV. Dolby Atmos offers surround sound, so it's similar to what you might expect if you had a bunch of speakers all around your living room. Except, instead of having a bunch of living room speakers all around you, this works through your headphones. 
Dolby Atmos allows musicians to create songs that specifically place vocals and instruments in certain areas of the ""sound stage."" And these are the new types of songs that are now available in Apple Music. 
This fall, Apple will build on it with a head-tracking feature for AirPods Pro and AirPods Pro Max that's already available for things like movies and TV shows that offer Dolby Atmos. When that's on, it sounds like the music is coming from the device that's playing it. So, if you have headphones on, and you turn your head, you'll hear the music shift in the direction of your iPhone, for example. Sort of like the iPhone is the stage. 
You need an Apple Music trial or a subscription, which costs $4.99 a month for students, $9.99 a month for individuals or $14.99 a month for families up to six people.
You can listen through:
But you don't actually need AirPods or Beats headphones. Dolby Atmos songs work on all headphones, you just need to turn on ""Always On"" in your iPhone or iPad settings first. 
To do that:
If you're listening from an Apple TV, you can listen to Dolby Atmos through speakers that support the format, or through the aforementioned AirPods and Beats headphones. To turn it on, go to Settings > Apps > Music and make sure Dolby Atmos is on ""Automatic."" On a Mac, you'll want to enable the setting to download in Dolby Atmos in the preferences menu of Apple Music.
It's easy to try Dolby Atmos spatial audio in Apple Music. 
If you open the app right now, you'll see several playlists for various genres with songs created to support Dolby Atmos. But I recommend starting with the ""Hits in Spatial Audio"" playlist, which provides an audio example of stereo vs. Dolby Atmos.
As new tracks and albums roll out, you'll see a little tag under each song that shows ""Dolby Atmos"" to let you know it supports the format. 
You can stream Dolby Atmos all you want. But if you want those tracks available when you don't have a Wi-Fi connection, you need to download them. And if you already have non-Dolby Atmos songs downloaded, you'll have to delete those and redownload the song to get it in the spatial audio format. 
You can make sure future downloads always download the Dolby Atmos version by opening Settings on your iPhone and tapping Music and enabling the Download in Dolby Atmos option.Subscribe to CNBC on YouTube.

Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google could be forced to overhaul their business practices under an expansive set of antitrust reforms introduced by a bipartisan group of House lawmakers on Friday.
The package of five bills, draft versions of which were reported by CNBC and other outlets, would make it harder for dominant platforms to complete mergers and prohibit them from owning businesses that present clear conflicts of interest. The legislation represents the most comprehensive effort to reform century-old antitrust laws in decades.
The bills will need to be voted on favorably by the Judiciary Committee before making their way to the full House. They would also need to be approved by the Senate before they could be signed into law by the president.
The measures come in the wake of a lengthy investigation by the House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust into the four companies that was completed last year.
The panel found at the time that Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google hold monopoly power and that antitrust laws should be revised to better deal with the unique challenges of competition in digital markets.
While Democrats and Republicans diverged on some of the solutions, they mostly agreed on the alleged competitive harm and that reform was necessary to reinvigorate the markets.
Two of the new bills introduced Friday could prove especially difficult for Amazon and Apple to navigate, given both operate marketplaces that include their own products or apps that compete with those of other sellers or developers that rely on their services, a risky set-up under the new legislation. Those bills comprise the Platform Anti-Monopoly Act — which seems to have been renamed the American Choice and Innovation Online Act — sponsored by House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust Chairman Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., and the Ending Platform Monopolies Act, sponsored by Vice Chair Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash.
The bills, in their draft form, already inspired pushback from tech-funded groups.
""Adopting the European regulatory model would make it harder for American tech companies to innovate and compete both here and globally,"" Geoffrey Manne, president and founder of the International Center for Law & Economics, said in a statement. The group has received funding from Google in the past. 
Adam Kovacevich, CEO of center-left advocacy group Chamber of Progress, backed by Amazon, Facebook and Google, among others, published a Medium post earlier this week arguing that consumers would lose out on more than a dozen popular features should those two bills pass.
Under those proposals, Kovacevich argued, Amazon would not be able to offer Prime free shipping for some products and Google could not serve users the most popular results for businesses in their areas because of rules against discriminating on their platforms. He also wrote that Apple would not be allowed to pre-install its own ""Find My"" apps on its devices that help users locate lost items. Facebook couldn't allow for easy cross-posting to Instagram, also due to the conflict of interest and non-discrimination provisions, Kovacevich argued.
Despite tech pushback, the bipartisan support for the bill is a formidable signal to the industry. The sector has inspired rare collaboration between Democrats and Republicans, who both believe tech companies have come to hold too much power and worry about stagnating innovation.
Spotify and Roku, which have been critical of the tech giants in the past, applauded some of the bills.
Spotify Chief Legal Officer Horacio Gutierrez called the American Choice and Innovation Online Act ""an important step in addressing anti-competitive conduct in the App Store ecosystem, and a clear sign that momentum has shifted as the world is waking up to the need to demand fair competition in the App economy.""
""Roku applauds Reps. David Cicilline and Ken Buck for taking a crucial step toward curbing the predatory and anticompetitive behaviors of some of the country's most powerful companies,"" Roku said in a statement. ""Roku has firsthand experience competing against and interacting with these monopolists, and we've seen how they flagrantly ignore antitrust laws and harm consumers by leveraging their dominance in one line of business to stifle competition in another. An aggressive set of reforms is needed to prevent a future where these monopolists further abuse consumer choice and hamper access to innovative and independent products.""
Here's an overview of the five bills announced on Friday:
