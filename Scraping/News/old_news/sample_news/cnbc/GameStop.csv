Billionaire tech investor Chamath Palihapitiya told CNBC on Wednesday that he closed out his position in GameStop, one day after joining the trading frenzy around the video game retailer.
Palihapitiya also defended the power of individual investors to compete with Wall Street hedge funds.
The CEO of Social Capital and former Facebook executive tweeted Tuesday that he bought $125,000 worth of February $115 GameStop call options after asking his followers on Twitter what to buy. Calls are derivatives that give the buyer the right to purchase a stock at a set price. The trader makes money when the stock rises above the strike price. GameStop stock opened Wednesday at $354 per share, up more than 1,550% this year alone.
Wednesday on CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report,"" Palihapitiya said, ""I ended up closing out my position this morning, and I wanted to announce that I'm taking all the profits that I made plus my original position — I'm going to take $500,000 and I'm going to donate it.""
Palihapitiya dismissed Wall Street criticism about how individual investors are banding together on social media — particularly the wallstreetbets Reddit message board, and short-squeezing GameStop and a handful of other stocks like pros — as hypocritical. He said hedge funds try to push stocks around all the time.
Allowing hedge funds to go short 140% of GameStop shares could be seen as irresponsible, he said. ""To a normal person that doesn't make any sense. But to a Wall Street mathematician, that's the game that's been played. And that game came undone.""
Shares of GameStop initially jumped earlier this month after the company said that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen was joining its board. As buyers plowed into the stock, shorts were sent running for the hills.
A short squeeze happens when a stock with a large bloc of short sellers starts to increase in price, and shorts scramble to buy shares at the current higher prices to limit their losses. They return the number of borrowed shares and lose the price difference.
Palihapitiya said the craze around GameStop shares, and a few other stocks like AMC Entertainment, is much more than just a trading story, arguing it's a pushback against the establishment.
""Instead of having 'idea dinners' or quiet whispered conversations amongst hedge funds in the Hamptons these kids have the courage to do it transparently in a forum,"" he said. ""What it proves is this retail [investor] phenomenon is here to stay. There are 2.7 million people inside wallstreetbets. I think they are as important as any hedge or collection of hedge funds.""
Palihapitiya said the best research on stocks done by retail investors inside wallstreetbets is nearly indistinguishable from the best research on Wall Street. ""That edge is gone. Now all of a sudden, retail can be on the same footing and they don't have to be the 'bag holder' to Wall Street.""
A veteran venture capitalist, Palihapitiya has had success lately sponsoring SPACs, blank-check special purpose acquisition companies. One of his SPACs completed its merger with Virgin Galactic in October 2019, allowing Richard Branson's space tourism venture to become a publicly traded company. That stock has gained more than 115% in 2021.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren lambasted the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday for the regulator's failure to take action after a dayslong blitz of market speculation.
""We need an SEC that has clear rules about market manipulation and then has the backbone to get in and enforce those rules,"" Warren said. ""To have a healthy stock market, you've got to have a cop on the beat.""
""That should be the SEC,"" she added. ""They need to step up and do their job.""
The SEC did not respond to CNBC's request for comment.
The Massachusetts Democrat joined CNBC after wild stock moves prompted popular trading app Robinhood to restrict access to the high-flying names at the center of the controversy.
Warren, a longtime critic of Wall Street, spoke to CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" as individual traders took to Reddit, Twitter and other social media platforms to protest Robinhood's move to curb trading in stocks like GameStop and AMC Entertainment.
But Warren made clear that she isn't a big fan of Robinhood, either.
Robinhood and similar firms, which offer incentives to join while forcing customers to sign arbitration clauses, don't help create healthy market conditions, she said.
Those arbitration clauses, she said, protect Robinhood ""if it turns out that [it] really did cheat you. It'll never be made public, there will be very little that you can do about.""
The public outrage toward Robinhood came after the California-based brokerage announced earlier on Thursday that it would bar customers from buying additional shares of companies including GameStop and move theater operator AMC Entertainment. It still allows customers to sell those stocks from their current portfolio.
Robinhood announced soon after Warren's interview that it will allow a limited amount of trading in those volatile stocks on Friday.
Investors on the irreverent WallStreetBets Reddit led an effort to ""squeeze"" short sellers to cover their bets in such stocks and, as a result, have sparked a frenzy of volatile trading in recent sessions. Many of those retail investors sparked the short squeeze through Robinhood's popular trading app.
Video game retailer GameStop is up about 200% so far this week, AMC has risen 145% and headphone maker Koss, another ""squeeze"" target, has surged a whopping 1,100%.
Robinhood's decision, which it says was motivated by ""extraordinary volatility in the markets,"" sparked criticism from both sides of the political aisle.
For her part, Warren said she is skeptical of a narrative that would relate the current trading to a classic ""David versus Goliath"" story that pits a scrappy group of retail investors against a colossal, hedge fund empire.
""That's the problem: How do you know who's manipulating the stock at this point?"" she asked. ""Are you entirely sure that there aren't wealthy people on both sides? That hedge funds haven't moved in on the side of the people who bid up the price of GameStop?""
Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a progressive who represents Silicon Valley, called for ""more regulation and equality"" and questioned the fairness of preventing individuals from buying.
""While retail trading in some cases, like on Robinhood, blocked the purchasing of GameStop, hedge funds were still allowed to trade the stock,"" Khanna said.
By buying GameStop or AMC equity or call options, retail investors have forced investors betting against the stock, known as short sellers and oftentimes hedge funds, to cover their positions by buying back shares in an effort prevent further losses.
When this occurs en masse, it can lead to a feedback cycle and a spike in a stock's price.

Restrictions on Robinhood traders got tighter throughout the day on Friday, only allowing clients to buy a single share of GameStop.
The stock trading app also expanded its list of restricted stocks from 13 earlier in the day to 50.
""The table below shows the maximum number of shares and options contracts to which you can increase your positions,"" Robinhood wrote. CNBC recreated the table.
The restricted list tells clients how many shares and options contracts they can buy pertaining to a particular security. Robinhood customers can only buy one share and up to five options contracts of GameStop; however, if a customer already owns one or more share of GameStop, they are not able to buy any more shares.
Robinhood's restrictions could take the wind out of point-and-click traders trying to jack up the price of GameStop. Robinhood, however, will not sell any client's shares of GameStop that are already over the one-share limit from a previous position.
The stock, which closed up 67%, was off its highs of the session as the new more severe limits were implemented. Earlier in the day, clients could buy five shares of GameStop.
The most shares clients could buy of any of the 50 stocks was five. Clients without existing shares can only buy one share and 10 options contracts in AMC Entertainment, which is down from an earlier 115 shares. Shares of AMC Entertainment closed up 53% but also well off their highs of the day. Clients can only buy one share of American Airlines, Bed Bath & Beyond and Koss.
The stock trading app has also expanded its list of restricted stocks. Some of the new names include Advanced Micro Devices, Starbucks, Novavax, General Motors and Beyond Meat.
On Thursday, Robinhood told clients it was only allowed to sell shares, not buy new ones, in certain securities that were garnering social media attention from Reddit crowds. The firm also raised margin requirements, or the amount of money in a client's account when they will be using leverage to buy a security. Robinhood's decision was met with outrage, with many users taking their grievance to Twitter.
Robinhood said the trading restrictions were risk management decisions to protect Robinhood and its clearinghouses, but touted that the restrictions would be eased on Friday.
The free trading pioneer raised $1 billion in investor money and tapped more credit lines overnight for its clients to be able to trade names like GameStop and AMC Entertainment on Friday.
However, the restrictions got tighter throughout the trading day, as the list of limited securities grew and the number of shares clients could buy shrunk for certain stocks.

After reading the classic finance book ""The Intelligent Investor"" a few years ago, Ryan, who asked that his last name be withheld to protect his privacy, became interested in learning more about how to use the stock market to build wealth.
Naturally, the now-24-year-old turned to the internet to continue his financial education. He says online forums like the now-infamous r/WallStreetBets (WSB) subreddit taught him more about money and investing than any book.
So when some WSB users began making a convincing case to buy GameStop stock at the tail end of 2020, Ryan's curiosity was piqued. The Detroit resident has a decent-paying day job and invests responsibly in mutual funds via his 401(k). But because he works from home and tries to adhere to social distancing rules, he also has some discretionary money to spend month to month, and has been dabbling in day trading via his Charles Schwab brokerage account. The thought of earning potentially thousands of dollars on a single stock was appealing.
""I make [around] $80,000 per year, and I thought I realistically could make $25,000 off of this, from the numbers I was looking at,"" Ryan says of his reasoning for buying. ""The information that was provided to me made a lot of sense.""
He bought 30 shares of GameStop stock in December. At that point, they were worth just over $17 per share. As the stock began to take off at the end of January, Ryan bought 19 more at just under $39 per share, bringing his total investment to $1,200. When GameStop closed at $225 per share Monday, it was worth just north of $11,000.
Ryan was pleased as his investment grew throughout January, and then shocked as worldwide attention over the past few weeks sent it sky-rocketing. But as investment platforms like Robinhood began halting trading of GameStop and other stocks last week, his joy transformed into anger over what he considered Wall Street not playing by its own rules once it started losing money to the little guy.
Like many others on WSB, Ryan became less concerned with making money at that point, and more interested in sticking it to hedge funds that had planned to short the stock. As of Monday afternoon, he was still holding his shares out of principle despite the dip in prices from the previous week.
""I want to make money out of this,"" Ryan says. ""I didn't buy out of spite."" But as last week's actions unfolded, he says he's now ""on board"" with ""bleeding"" the hedge funds, a popular sentiment among WSB.
Importantly, the money Ryan invested won't make or break his bank account. He'd prefer to get a return on his investment — but he can afford to lose it. Plus, he believes there is still more money to be made, given GameStop's current short rate. And Ryan's far from alone. WSB is still betting that holding GME will pay off.
""It doesn't worry me,"" he says of potentially losing his investment if the stock tanks. ""The idea that some of these big banks, these hedge funds, are burning right now, I'd rather see that happen. It's time for the common person to be on the same level as these hedge funds.""
While Ryan is taking calculated risks, experts warn that the situation is becoming dangerous for many individual investors who may see the headlines and, incorrectly believing that the situation is simply a David vs. Goliath story, jump head-first into the hype without doing their research.
There has been some speculation that the trading frenzy surrounding GameStop and other stocks is turning into a ""pump and dump"" scheme. Typically, this occurs when scammers buy cheap shares of a company before boosting its stock price by sharing positive, but fake, information. The fraudsters then encourage others to get in on the ""rocket ship,"" before selling their own shares at a high point and watching the price fall back to earth.
But GameStop isn't a classic pump-and-dump; there are real reasons many Redditors and other institutional investors bought shares of the stock and, in some cases, plan to keep holding. Still, non-professional investors without a lot of money to spare could lose out if they buy now.
""This is tremendously dangerous for retail traders who haven't traded before,"" James Royal, senior investing reporter at Bankrate, previously told CNBC Make It. ""The stock can drop precipitously in a matter of seconds or minutes. If you have no experience dealing with that kind of thing, you will lose your money very, very quickly.""
Ryan, for his part, isn't worried about losing out.
""I'm confident in my ability to pull out when I need to,"" he says.

The war between hedge funds and retail investors over shares of GameStop has one logical conclusion, according to executives and traders of a major Wall Street firm.
Shares of GameStop, the video game retailer, have climbed more than 900% since the start of the year after members of the Reddit community WallStreetBets banded together in an effort to push the stock higher.
The campaign pushed a stock worth $19 at the start of the year to as high as $482.85 on Thursday. Gains by retail investors have come at the expense of sophisticated investors like Melvin Capital and Citron Research, which were forced to close out their short positions as the stock rose in what's known as a short squeeze.
At some point, the thinking goes, shares of GameStop will stop climbing, either because most of the shorts have given up and are no longer forced into buying the stock to cover losing positions or because brokers or U.S. market regulators intervene.
At that point, human nature kicks in: Retail investors will watch as their paper profits evaporate, and the natural impulse will be to sell, according to the executives, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak frankly. Latecomers to the party will sell in fear, contributing to a stampede for the exits and a drop in the shares, they added. The same forces that helped the stock catapult higher will contribute to a rapid decline.
It's possible we got an early sign of what the unraveling will look like. Shares of GameStop fell for the first time in six trading sessions on Thursday, tumbling 44% after Robinhood and Interactive Brokers restricted activity in GameStop and some other heavily shorted stocks.
Still, there is no telling when a true unwinding will occur or how long it will take. The shares were rebounding sharply in Friday's premarket, up another 80% to $332 a share, after Robinhood reversed course and said it would allow limited purchases of the stock.
Despite costing hedge funds billions of dollars, GameStop remains one of the most shorted stocks in the market, according to FactSet data. More than 120% of GameStop's available shares have been borrowed, down from about 140% earlier in the month.
""Typically a short squeeze ends with a sharp sell-off, but there are buyers in waiting, often those covering shorts,"" said CC Lagator, co-founder of brokerage Options AI. ""That can provide temporary support in a stock that's unwinding a short squeeze.""
If retail investors get burned in the GameStop trade, it's likely the Securities and Exchange Commission will step in to prevent similar scenarios from occurring, according to another Wall Street source. Gary Gensler, President Joe Biden's pick for SEC head, has a reputation for tough enforcement.
""The hedge funds are big boys, they know how the game is played,"" said the banker, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""When the little guy gets hurt, that's when Washington gets involved. We'll have an SEC leader who is much more activist.""
Bubbles in stocks including GameStop are just the latest sign of unusual activity in markets since the coronavirus pandemic struck, forcing central banks to unleash trillions of dollars in support for economies around the world.
Early on in the crisis, a collapse in demand resulted in negative oil prices for the first time in history. Equities and other asset classes rapidly recovered, thanks to central banks, and have since hit record after record, leading to eye-popping valuations despite high unemployment and a rising death toll. Bitcoin prices surged from around $6,000 at the start of the pandemic to as high as $41,000 this month.
Now, with millions of Redditors wielding free trading apps, full saving accounts and not much else to do, it's possible that there is a new playbook for fast gains in the stock market.
""Is this a new platform for investors to make decisions, does it even the playing field?"" said Mark Williams, a Boston University finance lecturer and former Federal Reserve examiner. ""You could argue that what happened with Reddit is them putting the shorts in check, and that's a positive.""
Robinhood's move Thursday to limit the ability of its users to bid up GameStop and other companies targeted by Reddit investors drew bipartisan criticism from lawmakers who claimed that the brokerage was favoring big institutional traders over small investors.
""I do sense there's a double standard here,"" said a former Goldman Sachs trader who now works for a technology firm. ""Put it this way, if Goldman Sachs were doing this, it would be called `arbitrage'.""

Robinhood's decision to tap into its bank credit lines during the Reddit-sparked trading frenzy was done proactively, the CEO of the brokerage app told CNBC.
The news of Robinhood drawing on its bank credit lines, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, came after the broker on Thursday restricted users' ability to buy 13 securities, including shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment. Those stocks had become incredibly popular and volatile after being the target of online investors who hyped the names and instigated short squeezes.
""There was no liquidity problem,"" CEO Vlad Tenev said in an interview Thursday night with CNBCs Andrew Ross Sorkin. Rather, Tenev said Robinhood needed to meet requirements with its clearinghouses, which play a key role in finalizing a trade, and net capital obligations with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Robinhood has experienced unprecedented high volume of trading this week as the Reddit-inspired retail traders attempt a takeover of certain highly shorted stocks. Robinhood, which has to deposit money to a clearinghouse based on the volume of trades, said it restricted trading was because the firm was unable to meet the deposit requirements that it was anticipating. The requirements go up when volatility goes up in case of large losses by many options trades.
""With a lot of concentrated activity in some of these stocks, we need to deposit more money at our clearinghouses to allow for that activity to continue,"" Tenev said. ""By drawing on our credit lines, which we do all the time, as part of normal day-to-day operation, we get more capital that we can deposit with the clearinghouses. And that will allow us to enable ideally more investing with fewer restrictions.""
Robinhood also raised $1 billion from existing investors, according to reporting from Sorkin, who said on ""Squawk Box"" on Friday morning that the brokerage needed to shore up its balance sheet as it was set to ease trading restrictions on GameStop and other volatile stocks.
The move to lift some of its trading limits during Friday's session sent shares of the affected companies soaring in premarket trading. Robinhood's restrictions Thursday in some cases prohibited users from buying new shares. Instead, they could only sell existing positions. Many of those restricted stocks suffered major losses Thursday, with GameStop tanking more than 40% and AMC falling more than 55%.
Robinhood received fierce backlash for implementing trading limits from customers and a bipartisan group of lawmakers in Washington. Nevertheless, Tenev told Sorkin that Robinhood made the correct decision.
""In order to protect the firm and protect our customers we had to limit buying in these stocks,"" said Tenev, who co-founded the brokerage app in 2013. It has surged in popularity, particularly with younger investors, and helped pioneer zero-commission trading.
Robinhood last year hired Goldman Sachs to lead preparations for an initial public offering.
The premarket moves in stocks such as GameStop and AMC Entertainment signals the frenzied trading that has consumed Wall Street in recent days is likely to continue. Rallying together on forums like Reddit's WallStreetBets, a large cohort of retail investors have hyped up GameStop and other stocks with large short positions.
Short selling is a bet that a stock will decrease in price. But as GameStop's stock rose this month, shorts sought to limit their potential losses by purchasing stock at the current higher prices. Meanwhile, other investors continued to rally behind GameStop further increasing the stock's price.

Melvin Capital closed out its short position in GameStop on Tuesday afternoon after taking a huge loss, the hedge fund's manager told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin.
GameStop, hedge funds' most-hated stock, was targeted by an army of retail investors who marshaled forces against short sellers in online chat rooms. In the Reddit forum ""wallstreetbets"" with more than 2 million subscribers, rookie investors encouraged each other to pile into GameStop's shares and call options, creating massive short squeezes in the stock.
CNBC could not confirm the amount of losses Melvin Capital took on the short position. Citadel and Point72 have infused close to $3 billion into Gabe Plotkin's hedge fund to shore up its finances. On Wednesday's ""Squawk Box,"" Sorkin said Plotkin told him that speculation about a bankruptcy filing is false.
GameStop shares have soared more than 400% this week alone to $347.51 apiece, driving its January gains to 685%. The stock was worth just $6 four months ago.
Shares of the brick-and-mortar video game retailer popped another 134% on Wednesday, pushing the company's market cap to $24 billion.
GameStop was the single most traded name in the U.S. stock market on Tuesday, topping Tesla and Apple, even though they are 81 and 233 times larger in market cap terms, according to Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid.
Amid GameStop's explosive rally, short sellers have accumulated losses of more than $5 billion year to date in the stock, including a loss of $917 million on Monday and $1.6 billion on Friday, according to data from S3 Partners.
Short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research said Wednesday he has covered the majority of his short position in GameStop at a loss. He previously said GameStop will fall back to $20 a share ""fast"" and called out attacks from the ""angry mob"" that owns the stock.
Investor Michael Burry said in a now-deleted tweet Tuesday that trading in GameStop is ""unnatural, insane, and dangerous"" and there should be ""legal and regulatory repercussions."" Burry shot to fame by betting against the housing bubble and was featured in Michael Lewis' book ""The Big Short.""
The Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment.
Social Capital's Chamath Palihapitiya is among those who jumped into the stock, saying in a Tuesday tweet that he bought GameStop call options betting the stock will go higher. His tweet seemed to intensify the rally in the previous session. The stock ended the day 92% higher at $147.98.
After Tuesday's closing bell, Elon Musk commented on the mania, linking it to the ""wallstreetbets"" Reddit chat room. The Tesla CEO tweeted to his 42 million followers ""Gamestonk!!"" The comment appeared to help send GameStop shares soaring in extended trading Tuesday.

Reddit users and other retail investors who piled into GameStop stock aimed to take down Wall Street.
Pension funds, which support ordinary Americans in retirement, may be an unintended casualty.
Some hedge funds have sustained big losses as a result of bets against GameStop stock. Melvin Capital, for example, lost more than 50% in January.
But pension plans — which invest assets on behalf of workers like teachers and police officers — may hold big positions in hedge funds. That means a financial hit for hedge funds could spill over to workers' retirement assets.
""Your 'eat the rich' mentality just took a bite out of the pension funds of working Americans,"" Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said of GameStop investors who targeted Wall Street

""It's not a victimless game, and it's not a Wall Street billionaire who's going to ultimately pay the price,"" Roper added.
Roughly 7% of the $4.5 trillion in state and local pension plans are allocated to hedge funds, according to data published by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College and the Center for State and Local Government Excellence. These plans (which don't include plans in the private sector) support 14.7 million workers and 11.2 million retirees.
But many pensions allocate much more, some even north of 20% of their overall portfolio, according to Pensions & Investments.
The top four by overall portfolio share are: The Directors Guild of America-Producer Pension Plans (23%), Eli Lilly & Co. (28%), the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund (30%) and Eastman Kodak Co. (41%), according to P&I, which surveyed the 1,000 largest pension plans about their investments as of September 2019. (The company is publishing 2020 data next week.)  
The California State Teachers' Retirement System, State of Michigan Retirement Systems and Virginia Retirement System held the largest hedge-fund investments on a dollar basis: $14 billion, $12 billion and $11 billion, respectively, according to P&I. However, those holdings made up less of their overall portfolio relative to other investments (5.8%, 16.3% and 13.2%, respectively).
Of course, pensions with large hedge-fund holdings didn't necessarily lose money. Those that did bet against GameStop and other stocks like AMC Entertainment and Bed Bath & Beyond.
Hedge funds commonly employ a tactic called ""short selling,"" which makes them money when a stock's price falls. Retail investors targeted shares in GameStop and other companies heavily shorted by Wall Street in recent weeks — driving up the stock price and causing staggering losses in some hedge funds.
Shares of GameStop were up 400% last week, bringing the stock's total gain to 1,625% this year. (Shares fell sharply on Monday.)
Losses for some hedge funds — like Candlestick Capital Management, Citron Capital, D1 Capital Partners, Maplelane Capital, Melvin Capital and Point72 — extended into the double digits.
""It absolutely has a ripple effect,"" Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, said of hedge-fund woes extending to pensions. ""When these types of things start to happen, it's not like you can target it to this one firm or fund that'll be hurt.
""There's absolutely collateral damage,"" he added.
Many plans aimed to increase their allocations to hedge funds and other alternative assets in 2020 to try boosting returns amid lower relative yields from safer assets like cash and bonds.

Critics view Robinhood restricting GameStop trades as 'an absolute travesty',https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/critics-call-robinhood-restricting-gamestop-trades-travesty.html,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNBC,"
Major brokerages restricting trading in GameStop, AMC and other stocks in the wake of their meteoric rise over the past few days has caused critics to rail against what they call an example of a rigged financial system.
""Gotta admit it's really something to see Wall Streeters with a long history of treating our economy as a casino complain about a message board of posters also treating the market as a casino,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., tweeted Wednesday.
Ocasio-Cortez is referring to the extraordinary story of GameStop trading that has played out on social media over the past few days. Fueled in part by a group of non-professional investors — called ""retail"" investors in the industry — on Reddit pushing shares higher and squeezing out hedge funds, the stock for the struggling video game retailer has surged dramatically.
That hurt hedge funds that were shorting the stock and are now left watching their losses mount. Short selling is a strategy in which investors borrow shares of the stock at a certain price under the expectation that its market value will be worth less when it's time to actually pay for those borrowed shares. In other words, several hedge funds bet on the stock prices dropping.
Retail investors on Reddit and Twitter, meanwhile, have celebrated the events as a ""win"" for the little guy against Wall Street.
But brokerages catering to those same people, including Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade and others, began restricting users' ability to trade certain stocks Thursday amid the extreme volatility. Robinhood and Interactive Brokers also raised margin requirements on certain securities, which increases the amount of money an investor using leverage and derivatives is required to have in their brokerage account after a stock purchase.
""We continuously monitor the markets and make changes where necessary,"" Robinhood said on its blog. ""In light of recent volatility, we are restricting transactions for certain securities,"" including AMC, GameStop, Nokia and others. In an update late Thursday, the company further explained its decision and said that the app planned to allow ""limited buys"" of the securities on Friday.
Interactive Brokers chairman Thomas Peterffy offered a similar explanation, saying the company curbed trading to help ""safeguard the marketplace,"" as well as the brokerages themselves. When investors buy and sell using leverage, their trades are only backed by a fraction of the total cost, so it's possible they will incur losses greater than they're able to cover. If this happens, the brokerage can be on the hook to cover the loss.
The extreme volatility means prices are changing dramatically from one moment to the next, says Bryan Routledge, associate professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business.
""Robinhood caters to individual investors, so you can certainly imagine a situation where they want to offer some protection,"" says Routledge. ""On the other side of that, annoying your client base is a business cost.""
And the decision did enrage many retail investors, who view the situation as Wall Street not playing by its own rules once it started losing. Not only are the brokerages costing them money, they say, but, in the case of Robinhood specifically, they are reneging on their explicit promise to ""democratize"" investing.
Robinhood's decision underscores some people's belief that the deck is stacked against them, says Zach Abraham, founder and chief investment officer of Bulwark Capital Management, where he advises retail investors.
Abraham characterizes platforms restricting trades for retail investors as ""an absolute travesty,"" noting that many of the Redditors' moves weren't just some ""troll,"" but calculated based on their own research. The hedge funds made ""bad calls,"" he says, and retail investors caught them on it.
""This is only going to perpetuate the wealth gap, and that the rich play by different rules,"" says Abraham, whose firm sold its positions in GameStop last week. ""If the roles were reversed, nobody would be saying a thing.""
At the same time, the situation has morphed into a dangerous game for other retail investors who read into the recent hype but don't understand the risks involved in trading, Abraham says.
""This isn't some new riskless way for investors to make money,"" writes Dave Sekera, Morningstar's chief market strategist. ""Once enough of the shorts have been flushed out, there won't be any new buyers to keep the stock price propped up, and, like a plane hitting an air pocket, the stock price will drop.""
The stocks are currently ""way over-priced,"" says Abraham. Getting in now on the news-making names of the past few days would be akin to gambling.
""I could not emphasize more clearly for retail investors: Take those names off your screen and look elsewhere,"" Abraham says. He predicts GameStop and other stocks will ""blow up"" in the coming days. ""You just don't want to be messing around with these names today.""

Shares of a handful of cannabis stocks surged Wednesday, the newest set of targets from the Reddit trading community betting on the federal legalization of the plant under the new Democratic administration.
Shares of Tilray soared 50%, bringing the stock's year-to-date gain to more than 670%. Canopy Growth rose 6%, adding to its 110% rally in 2021. Aphria popped 10%, adding to its 280% gain this year. Aurora Cannabis rose 20%, bringing its year-to-date rise to more than 120%.
The group of cannabis companies are garnering attention from the same WallStreetBets Reddit army that contributed to the epic short squeeze in GameStop last month. Several posts on the social media forum show users expressing optimism about the stocks' upside.
""$TLRY $APHA calls since 1/5/2021 got me to over $500k today. Still think it has much upside,"" one Reddit post said.
""Weed about to make me a millionaire in 2021,"" another post, with more than 107,000 likes, said.
""We believe the rally in Canadian names is mostly driven by retail investors, maybe fueled by Robinhood and Reddit, that's really piling into the Canadian cannabis names in particular,"" Pablo Zuanic, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, told CNBC. ""I'm not going to say it's a GameStop type of case but the Canadian rally is not entirely based on fundamentals. But when we talk to clients we tell them careful trying to short these Canadian names because you know what happened with GameStop on the way up.""
The move in pot stocks could also be related to high short interest ratios, which measure how many of a company's traded shares are being used in bets against the company. GameStop and AMC Entertainment were targeted by retail traders in part because their high short interest made the stocks attractive candidates for a so-called short squeeze. Tilray's short interest is equal to 22.5% of the shares available for trading, according to FactSet. The official short interest data is current as of Jan. 29.
""The feedback is its some of the message boards are putting the big salient names in their scope,"" W. Andrew Carter, an analyst at Stifel, told CNBC. He has a sell rating on Canopy Growth and Aurora. Stifel has a hold rating on Aphria and Tilray.
""The shorts have mostly gone home for the year so the unwinding isn't as much of a tail wind as it was for the early price action, it just really is just that much buying and not much resistance,"" the analyst said. ""It's very difficult to justify where these stocks are trading right now.""
While the Reddit traders are seemingly bullish on the names, Wall Street has a different tune. Of the 14 analysts who cover Tilray, only two have a buy rating on the stock, according to FactSet. Of the 20 analysts who cover Canopy Growth, only two recommend buying the name and of the 11 analysts who cover Aphria, seven have a buy rating.
""This is totally on script for the anti-establishment movement on WSB and Reddit. They are feeling their crowd-funding oats and are now aiming it at whatever social disruption they can cause,"" Tim Welsh, founder and CEO of wealth management consulting firm Nexus Strategy, told CNBC. ""And no better historical symbol to amplify personal freedom and revolution than pot.""
Part of the discussion on Reddit has centered around the pending merger between Tilray and Aphria. According to a December press release, Aphria shareholders are set to receive roughly 0.84 share of Tilray per one share of Aphria when the deal closes.
Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. equity strategist, David Kostin, said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" that the gains for popular Reddit stocks were related to a strong start to the year for small caps and a continued surge of new special purpose acquisition companies.
""The pockets of excess, if you will, or buoyance or frothiness, definitely exist in some sectors ... but at the end of the day rates are super low,"" Kostin said.
The cannabis companies have also gotten a boost from the intentions of the Democratic Party, which now holds the White House and a majority in Congress, to legalize the plant at the federal level.
Canaccord Genuity analyst Matt Bottomley downgraded Canopy Growth to sell from hold on Wednesday, saying that the Canadian company's stock price had run up too far given the legalization landscape in the U.S.
""Although we believe it is possible for Cdn LPs to eventually secure THC exposure in the US, we do not foresee federal cannabis legalization in the US anytime soon and believe CGC's value appreciation as of late is likely not met with corresponding fundamental upside at this time,"" Bottomley said in a note.
Tilray is no stranger to the short squeeze that occurred in GameStop and AMC last month. In 2018, shortly after it went public, the Canadian pot producer's stock was ensnared in a wild short squeeze and rose about 1,400% between July and September of that year on an intraday basis.
Tilray CEO Brendan Kennedy told CNBC during the GameStop drama that he was experiencing PTSD from his own short squeeze years before.
""I remember getting five different calls from Nasdaq in a single day about our stock being halted because the short sellers were being squeezed so badly,"" Kennedy told ""Squawk on the Street."" ""My advice to those CEOs would be that, at times like this, your company is not your stock and your stock is not your company.""

"'I thought I realistically could make $25,000 off of this:' Why Redditors are holding GameStop",https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/why-redditors-are-holding-gamestop-stock.html,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",CNBC,"

After reading the classic finance book ""The Intelligent Investor"" a few years ago, Ryan, who asked that his last name be withheld to protect his privacy, became interested in learning more about how to use the stock market to build wealth.
Naturally, the now-24-year-old turned to the internet to continue his financial education. He says online forums like the now-infamous r/WallStreetBets (WSB) subreddit taught him more about money and investing than any book.
So when some WSB users began making a convincing case to buy GameStop stock at the tail end of 2020, Ryan's curiosity was piqued. The Detroit resident has a decent-paying day job and invests responsibly in mutual funds via his 401(k). But because he works from home and tries to adhere to social distancing rules, he also has some discretionary money to spend month to month, and has been dabbling in day trading via his Charles Schwab brokerage account. The thought of earning potentially thousands of dollars on a single stock was appealing.
""I make [around] $80,000 per year, and I thought I realistically could make $25,000 off of this, from the numbers I was looking at,"" Ryan says of his reasoning for buying. ""The information that was provided to me made a lot of sense.""
He bought 30 shares of GameStop stock in December. At that point, they were worth just over $17 per share. As the stock began to take off at the end of January, Ryan bought 19 more at just under $39 per share, bringing his total investment to $1,200. When GameStop closed at $225 per share Monday, it was worth just north of $11,000.
Ryan was pleased as his investment grew throughout January, and then shocked as worldwide attention over the past few weeks sent it sky-rocketing. But as investment platforms like Robinhood began halting trading of GameStop and other stocks last week, his joy transformed into anger over what he considered Wall Street not playing by its own rules once it started losing money to the little guy.
Like many others on WSB, Ryan became less concerned with making money at that point, and more interested in sticking it to hedge funds that had planned to short the stock. As of Monday afternoon, he was still holding his shares out of principle despite the dip in prices from the previous week.
""I want to make money out of this,"" Ryan says. ""I didn't buy out of spite."" But as last week's actions unfolded, he says he's now ""on board"" with ""bleeding"" the hedge funds, a popular sentiment among WSB.
Importantly, the money Ryan invested won't make or break his bank account. He'd prefer to get a return on his investment — but he can afford to lose it. Plus, he believes there is still more money to be made, given GameStop's current short rate. And Ryan's far from alone. WSB is still betting that holding GME will pay off.
""It doesn't worry me,"" he says of potentially losing his investment if the stock tanks. ""The idea that some of these big banks, these hedge funds, are burning right now, I'd rather see that happen. It's time for the common person to be on the same level as these hedge funds.""
While Ryan is taking calculated risks, experts warn that the situation is becoming dangerous for many individual investors who may see the headlines and, incorrectly believing that the situation is simply a David vs. Goliath story, jump head-first into the hype without doing their research.
There has been some speculation that the trading frenzy surrounding GameStop and other stocks is turning into a ""pump and dump"" scheme. Typically, this occurs when scammers buy cheap shares of a company before boosting its stock price by sharing positive, but fake, information. The fraudsters then encourage others to get in on the ""rocket ship,"" before selling their own shares at a high point and watching the price fall back to earth.
But GameStop isn't a classic pump-and-dump; there are real reasons many Redditors and other institutional investors bought shares of the stock and, in some cases, plan to keep holding. Still, non-professional investors without a lot of money to spare could lose out if they buy now.
""This is tremendously dangerous for retail traders who haven't traded before,"" James Royal, senior investing reporter at Bankrate, previously told CNBC Make It. ""The stock can drop precipitously in a matter of seconds or minutes. If you have no experience dealing with that kind of thing, you will lose your money very, very quickly.""
Ryan, for his part, isn't worried about losing out.
""I'm confident in my ability to pull out when I need to,"" he says.

Robinhood on Tuesday rolled back more of its trading limitations, now allowing clients to buy up to 100 shares of GameStop.
GameStop climbed off the lows as the Robinhood changes were announced. Shares of the brick-and-mortar game retailer tanked 60% on Tuesday, bringing its decline to more than 70% this week.
Robinhood also raised the limits on AMC Entertainment and Express and Koss. BlackBerry and Genius Brands were no longer being restricted.
The restricted list tells clients how many shares and options contracts they can buy for a security.
Robinhood clients can now buy 100 shares of GameStop, up from the previous limitation of 20. However, investors who own more than 100 shares can't buy one more share of the stock.
Clients can now buy 1,250 shares of AMC Entertainment, up from the 350 earlier in the trading day. Shares of AMC dropped 41% on Tuesday.
Robinhood clients can now buy 3,000 shares of Express, up from the 1,000 share limit. Investors can buy up to 12,000 shares of Naked Brand Group up from the previous restrictions of 6,500. Nokia's buying cap is the same at 2,000 shares.
Robinhood started restricting a trading of a handful of stocks last week amid an increase in capital requirements from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation due to the retail investing frenzy in heavily shorted names. Reddit-fueled traders drove GameStop's stock up more than 400% in an effort to crush the hedge funds shorting the name.
However, while GameStop's stock rose, regulatory bodies increased the amount that Robinhood needed to deposit at its clearinghouses in case the trades caused large losses.
Robinhood raised another $2.4 billion from investors to support its record customer growth, the company said in a blog post Monday. This added to the $1 billion raised last week to shore up Robinhood's balance sheet in anticipation of the rampant speculative trading. The company also tapped credit lines for more funds.

Former TD Ameritrade CEO Fred Tomczyk told CNBC on Friday he believes retail stock market investors have never had it better when it comes to competing against Wall Street pros.
""When you think about what the retail investor has today, they have free trading, free research, free investor education, and they have faster and better trade execution than ever,"" Tomczyk said in an interview on ""Squawk on the Street.""
""The playing field between the retail and the institutional investor is more level than I've ever seen it,"" added Tomczyk, who led the brokerage firm as president and chief executive from 2008 to 2016. He's now on the board of Cboe Global Markets.
Tomczyk's comments came one day after the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services held a hearing focused on the GameStop short squeeze that began in late January. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy was another flashpoint in a long-running debate over fairness in the stock market, and whether mom-and-pop investors have equal access to generating returns.
One of the participants at Thursday's hearing was Keith Gill, the Reddit user and YouTuber who played a key role in promoting GameStop shares. In his testimony, Gill defended his decision to publicly tout his investment thesis in GameStop by noting what he considered long-standing imbalances for retail traders.
""Hedge funds and other Wall Street firms have teams of analysts working together to compile research and analyze shares of companies,"" said Gill, whose latest post on Reddit showed he made $7.8 million off GameStop. ""Individual investors do not have those resources. Social media platforms like Reddit, YouTube and Twitter are leveling the playing field.""
In August, Gill posted a video to his YouTube channel that argued the video-game retailer's stock was undervalued and vulnerable to a short squeeze due to so many bearish bets placed against it.
Tomczyk said he finds the success individual investors had during the meteoric rise in GameStop's shares — which went from less than $20 in early January to an intraday high of $483 on Jan. 28 — to be noteworthy.
""The ironic part, when you stand back and look at all this, is the party that seems to have lost the most in this GameStop trading was at actually a hedge fund. It wasn't a retail investor,"" Tomczyk said. ""Many retail investors did very well, so in my mind, they've done very well and they've never had it better based on smart regulation and the use of technology today.""
Other participants in the committee hearing Thursday were Gabe Plotkin, who runs hedge fund Melvin Capital, and Ken Griffin, the billionaire founder of market maker Citadel Securities. Griffin also is CEO of a similarly named hedge fund, Citadel.
Melvin Capital took a huge loss during the GameStop frenzy after it closed out its short position on Jan. 26. Short-sellers borrow shares of a stock and then promptly sell them, with the goal of purchasing them back later at a lower price. They then give back the borrowed shares and make money off the difference. But when the opposite happens, like with GameStop, short-sellers might buy shares at their current higher price in an attempt to minimize losses.
Plotkin on Thursday told Congress his hedge fund will adapt its short-selling approach now that it's observed the impact social media can have when harnessed by retail traders. ""That was a risk factor that, up until recently, we had never seen,"" he said.
In an interview Friday on CNBC, Griffin was asked by ""Squawk Box"" co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin whether he and individual investors had ""the same opportunity"" to make money in the stock market.
""It all comes down to a matter of horizon and strategy,"" Griffin said. ""It's like asking, 'If I went and played golf this weekend with Tiger Woods, would I win? Of course not, but there are various ways to compete with Tiger Woods off a golf course and do very well. I'm not going to play him on his game on his course.""
For example, Griffin said people who happen to be tech savvy might see opportunities to invest in publicly traded companies that are disrupting a particular industry. Or, he said, someone who bought shares of Tesla five years ago under the belief that electric vehicles were the future of the automotive industry ""would have made a lot more money than we made at Citadel.""
Shares of Tesla are up more than 2,200% in the past five years.
""I never underestimate the skill of the American retail investor at understanding emerging trends where real wealth is created and their ability to take advantage of that wealth transformation,"" added Griffin.

Mentions of GameStop increased on Reddit days before shares of the video-game retailer took off again, according to Justin Zhen, co-founder of Thinknum, a tech firm that compiles alternative data sets for investors.
""In the last 24 hours, we saw the number of occurrences of mentions for GameStop spike. It actually started spiking about four days ago,"" Zhen said in an interview Thursday on CNBC's ""The Exchange."" 
""The volume today has been insane, but we see a huge spike in advance of the run-up of the stock yesterday,"" he said.
Zhen was referencing Wednesday's major late-day gain in GameStop shares, which ultimately closed higher by more than 100%. The stock rallied further during Thursday's volatile session and was halted multiple times. It ended up closing Thursday at $108.73 per share, up 18.6%. It had reached as high as $184.68 intraday.
The sudden surge followed news Tuesday that the company's chief financial officer, Jim Bell, plans to resign in late March. Media reports suggested the departure could be linked to board member Ryan Cohen's desire to see GameStop accelerate its digital transformation.
The stock's big two-day move puzzled some on Wall Street, and CNBC's Jim Cramer contended earlier Thursday that a CFO shakeup is unlikely to be a catalyst for such a significant rally. Whatever the cause, the GameStop resurgence calls to mind the Reddit-sparked trading mania that first engulfed the stock in January, when it soared to $483 per share.
""What happened with GameStop when it went to $480 was one of the dumbest, most nonsensical things that I've seen in quite some time. This is the second dumbest,"" Loop Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba said Thursday on CNBC's ""Power Lunch."" He recently dropped his GameStop coverage, citing its disconnection from fundamentals.
""I'm gobsmacked now, just as I was a few weeks ago,"" Chukumba added.
The late January surge in GameStop put financial pressure on hedge funds and other investors who shorted the stock, which is essentially a bet that it will decrease in price. 
The saga has in some ways served as a wake-up call for the hedge fund industry, according to Gabe Plotkin, founder of Melvin Capital. Plotkin's fund got caught on the wrong end of the GameStop trade January.
Going forward, Plotkin told Congress earlier this month that he expects funds, including his own, to more closely monitor social media sites now that the power of forums like Reddit's WallStreetBets have been demonstrated.
""I think they saw an opportunity to drive the price of a stock higher and today with social media and other memes, there's the ability to collectively do so,"" he said. ""That was a risk factor that, up until recently, we had never seen.""
Zhen co-founded Thinknum in 2014, according to his LinkedIn, but the company's Reddit-specific dataset went live in late January as the GameStop frenzy was unfolding. 
According to a blog post on Thinknum's website, the dataset ""tracks the number of times NYSE and NASDAQ tickers are mentioned in the top 100 posts on r/WallStreetBets and r/Stocks in real time.""
In Thursday's CNBC interview, Zhen stressed that Thinknum does not claim for its online datasets to be predictive of stocks poised to rally.
""We provide a service where investors can track when the number of mentions on Reddit for any particular stock is increasing. We don't interpret or analyze the data. We don't claim the stock will go up,"" said Zhen, who used to work at a hedge fund.
 ""But what we are saying is that there's a lot of chatter around the stock today ... and if you're an investor, you need to pay attention,"" he said.
In addition to the recently launched Reddit offering, Zhen said Thinknum has about 30 other datasets, such as those focused on product pricing and where companies are opening stores. ""Reddit is one oversized sample recently but there are many other data trails that good investors pay attention to,"" Zhen said.
The Securities and Exchange Commission said in January that it was reviewing the GameStop saga. When asked by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin asked whether Thinknum has been contacted by the SEC, Zhen said: ""We have gotten many inquiries from government bodies, which I can't comment on specifically.""
Thinknum also has seen increased interest from investors and corporations, Zhen said. ""The interest has been substantial. It's the most I've seen in six years doing this.""

Reddit users and other retail investors who piled into GameStop stock aimed to take down Wall Street.
Pension funds, which support ordinary Americans in retirement, may be an unintended casualty.
Some hedge funds have sustained big losses as a result of bets against GameStop stock. Melvin Capital, for example, lost more than 50% in January.
But pension plans — which invest assets on behalf of workers like teachers and police officers — may hold big positions in hedge funds. That means a financial hit for hedge funds could spill over to workers' retirement assets.
""Your 'eat the rich' mentality just took a bite out of the pension funds of working Americans,"" Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, said of GameStop investors who targeted Wall Street

""It's not a victimless game, and it's not a Wall Street billionaire who's going to ultimately pay the price,"" Roper added.
Roughly 7% of the $4.5 trillion in state and local pension plans are allocated to hedge funds, according to data published by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College and the Center for State and Local Government Excellence. These plans (which don't include plans in the private sector) support 14.7 million workers and 11.2 million retirees.
But many pensions allocate much more, some even north of 20% of their overall portfolio, according to Pensions & Investments.
The top four by overall portfolio share are: The Directors Guild of America-Producer Pension Plans (23%), Eli Lilly & Co. (28%), the Alaska Electrical Pension Fund (30%) and Eastman Kodak Co. (41%), according to P&I, which surveyed the 1,000 largest pension plans about their investments as of September 2019. (The company is publishing 2020 data next week.)  
The California State Teachers' Retirement System, State of Michigan Retirement Systems and Virginia Retirement System held the largest hedge-fund investments on a dollar basis: $14 billion, $12 billion and $11 billion, respectively, according to P&I. However, those holdings made up less of their overall portfolio relative to other investments (5.8%, 16.3% and 13.2%, respectively).
Of course, pensions with large hedge-fund holdings didn't necessarily lose money. Those that did bet against GameStop and other stocks like AMC Entertainment and Bed Bath & Beyond.
Hedge funds commonly employ a tactic called ""short selling,"" which makes them money when a stock's price falls. Retail investors targeted shares in GameStop and other companies heavily shorted by Wall Street in recent weeks — driving up the stock price and causing staggering losses in some hedge funds.
Shares of GameStop were up 400% last week, bringing the stock's total gain to 1,625% this year. (Shares fell sharply on Monday.)
Losses for some hedge funds — like Candlestick Capital Management, Citron Capital, D1 Capital Partners, Maplelane Capital, Melvin Capital and Point72 — extended into the double digits.
""It absolutely has a ripple effect,"" Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, said of hedge-fund woes extending to pensions. ""When these types of things start to happen, it's not like you can target it to this one firm or fund that'll be hurt.
""There's absolutely collateral damage,"" he added.
Many plans aimed to increase their allocations to hedge funds and other alternative assets in 2020 to try boosting returns amid lower relative yields from safer assets like cash and bonds.

GameStop shares tanked again Thursday as the Reddit-fueled trade unraveled further.
The stock traded lower by more than 42%, bringing the video-game retailer's losses for the week to more than 83%.
The latest price drop came even after trading app Robinhood rolled back some of its trading limits on the stock.
GameStop experienced a meteoric rise last week in a major short squeeze orchestrated by Reddit users. Point-and-click investors piled into the name, driving its share price up 400%, while hedge funds rushed to cover their losses from shorting the stock.
Short selling is a strategy in which investors borrow shares of a stock at a certain price on expectations the market value will fall below that level when it's time to buy back the borrowed shares they have sold.
Millennial-favored trading app Robinhood, which started restricting trading of a handful of stocks last week amid an increase in capital requirements from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, now allows clients to purchase up to 500 shares of GameStop. Earlier this week, clients could only buy one share of the company.
However, investors who own more than 500 shares can't buy additional shares.
The only other stock Robinhood is still restricting is AMC Entertainment. Customers can't buy any shares of the movie-theater operator if they own 5,500 shares.
Regulators in Washington are looking into the GameStop trading mania. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday she will meet with the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and Federal Reserve officials to discuss ""whether recent activities are consistent with investor protection and fair and efficient markets.""

The GameStop story added another wild chapter on Wednesday as the retailer's stock popped 40% before quickly falling back to earth. The move appeared to be on no new headlines.
The stock rose as high as $348.50 per share on Wednesday, topping its record closing high from Jan. 27. The shares were then paused for volatility by the exchange. However, the shares lost all of those gains in a rapid decline around 12:30 p.m. ET.
The shares were halted down 12% at just under $200 per share. The stock bounced around after trading resumed and closed up 7.3%.
The stock, which rose dramatically in January as retail traders bid up the stock to create a short squeeze, was given a boost recently when the company announced that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen would lead a committee to help GameStop transition to e-commerce.
GameStop was the headliner of a group of heavily shorted stocks that were targeted by retail traders on Reddit earlier this year. Short selling is a strategy in which investors borrow shares of a stock at a certain price on hopes that the market value will fall below that level. If the shares rise instead, the short sellers are forced to buy the stocks and cover their positions, creating a feedback loop known as a short squeeze.
The January surge above $300 per share for GameStop forced brokerages including Robinhood to limit trading in heavily shorted stocks, and the momentum reversed in February. The volatility has spawned a series of Congressional hearings involving Reddit and YouTube trader Keith Gill.
GameStop has remained a regular conversation on Reddit in recent weeks, with a post on Wednesday reading, ""Hold GME to the moon. We're coming for $300 today.""
The original short squeeze for GameStop hit several hedge funds hard, and appeared to unnerve the broader markets. Some professional investors have pointed to GameStop's volatile trading as emblematic of frothiness in parts of the market.
""I really am concerned that there's too much promotion, there's too much speculation, there's too much trading stocks as lottery tickets for companies that are far from proven,"" Brad Gerstner, founder and CEO of Altimeter Capital, said Wednesday CNBC's ""Halftime Report."" ""That's never the way we try to make money. Just stay out of the way. We don't trade very much. We buy and hold for the long term.""
 A GameStop spokesperson wasn't immediately available for comment.

Retail investors are continuing to jump into the market in droves even after the dust has settled from the GameStop trading saga.
The major online brokers continue to see elevated app downloads, well above levels from last year, according to JMP Securities using SimilarWeb app download data.
Millennial-favored stock trading app Robinhood saw app downloads top 2.1 million in February, a 55% increase from a year ago. While that was down from January's banner month, where Robinhood saw more than 3.6 million downloads, the data shows the rookie investors are still coming into the market.
""App download activity that began 2021 with tremendous momentum, surging during the days of the Reddit/social media short squeezes, but has still remained well above average, even as the news cycle and traders' attention changed,"" JMP analyst Devin Ryan told clients.
Investors found themselves embroiled in a major trading saga with a number of heavily-shorted stocks, including GameStop, unexpectedly skyrocketing in late January amidst a boom in retail trading.
At the height of GameStop's surge, Robinhood and other brokers restricted trading of certain securities due to increased capital requirements from clearing houses. However, the brokerages' reputations seem to be intact. Fidelity, E-trade, TD Ameritrade, Coinbase and Webull all saw elevated app downloads in February.
GameStop is still seeing some wacky trading in March. The brick-and-mortar retailer popped 40% on Wednesday, for no apparent reason, and then turned negative minutes later. While the wild trading the occurred in January is unlikely to recur, the volatility could persist as retail investors grow in their overall influence in the stock market.
""We do think new app downloads and account activity will remain above pre-pandemic levels and the baseline for trading activity has moved permanently higher following the record number of new customers into the industry,"" added Ryan.
Retail trading has been accelerating since the industrywide decision to drop commissions in the fall of 2019. Since then, the pandemic-fueled market volatility brought new investors into the world of stocks, sometimes for the first time. Work-from-home, stimulus checks and higher personal savings levels, as well as social media platforms like Reddit, have only accelerated the boom in retail trading.
Plus, web traffic on the major brokers continues to move higher and set new records, signaling that retail investors are trading often.
""We continue to see a tremendous opportunity for firms to capitalize on this elevated engagement to earn more of their customers' wallet share over time,"" added Ryan.
Institutional investors might have to start paying more attention to the little guy given their ever-increasing presence in the market.
By using ""big data,"" Goldman Sachs' derivatives team determined that the dollar value of small-lot trades—a proxy for retail trades — has risen by 85% over the past year, leaving small traders a much more powerful market force, the firm said.
""The retail traders are becoming a much larger and larger component of overall volume,"" Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab said on a webinar on Wednesday.
Goldman's chief U.S. equity strategist David Kostin said the abundance of household cash should continue to fuel the retail trading boom. The firm estimates U.S. households have accumulated about $1.5 trillion in ""excess"" savings that should rise to about $2.4 trillion by the middle of 2021.
""With short-dated interest rates likely to remain near zero for several more years, retail investors are likely to continue to re-allocate funds to asset markets such as equities that have greater return potential,"" Kostin said in a note to clients.
In fact, Kostin expects households to be the largest source of equity demand in 2021, with economic growth historically being the key driver of retail trading participation on the markets. Goldman raised its household net equity demand forecast to $350 billion from $100 billion on Sunday.
The hike ""reflects faster economic growth and higher interest rates than we had assumed previously, additional stimulus payments to individuals, and increased retail activity in early 2021,"" Kostin told clients.
The $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package is expected to pass this week and is set to include $1,400 stimulus checks, which could be used for securities trading.
Retail trading activity has also become a valuable signal for stock differentiation.
Stocks that see an increase in small-lot shares and options trading activity outperform in the subsequent 5 to 10 days, Goldman's derivates team found.
Schwab's Frederick echoed this finding on Wednesday, saying retail traders having a great deal of success.
""By and large man of them are have done quite well,"" said Frederick. ""Buying dips has been a pretty effective strategy.""

The latest round of $1,400 stimulus checks is making its way to eligible Americans.
Now, those people have an important decision to make — what are they going to do with the extra money?
For some, the cash will be used to bet on the market in popular stocks such as GameStop and AMC.
Investors between the ages of 25 and 34 plan to spend half of stimulus payments on stocks, and those 18 to 24 will spend about 40% on the assets, a recent survey from Deutsche Bank found. Stimulus payment tracking data from Cardify.ai, a market research company, found that respondents plan to spend 32% of their checks on stocks or cryptocurrencies.
More from Invest in You:Suze Orman: Don't invest your stimulus checks. Here's what to doWomen are more financially stressed. Here's how to overcome itWomen lag behind men in saving for retirement. Covid made it worse
So-called meme stocks have been on a wild, retail-investor fueled ride as of late. GameStop in recent months was driven up in part by traders from Reddit looking to squeeze hedge funds betting against the company. The stock tanked 33% on Wednesday following the company's quarterly earnings report, but then erased the loss in midday trading Thursday.
Financial planners generally advise that people use their stimulus checks to shore up personal finances and build for the future.
Still, some may want to allocate part of the windfall to a hot stock.
""As long as they understand that it's a gamble and not the true path to wealth, that's okay,"" said Jessica Goedtel, a certified financial planner and lead planner at Facet Wealth, registered investment advisor in Baltimore.
""But, times like this are really good opportunities where we can reevaluate where we're trying to go in life and what we're trying to do with our money,"" she said.
This year especially has highlighted the importance of having some emergency savings in the bank, making such an account a great place for some of your latest stimulus check.
""If someone doesn't have an emergency fund, that's a good place to start,"" said Anjali Jariwala, CFP, CPA and founder of FIT Advisors in Torrance, California.
And, you don't necessarily have to allocate your entire check to savings if you have multiple financial goals. Studies have shown that even having small amounts of money saved, such as $100, can keep families from adverse events like having utilities shut off or needing to move.
If you have any outstanding debt, putting all or some of your stimulus check towards it is also a solid financial idea.
Experts generally advise starting with high-interest debt, such as credit cards, first. The more you can pay down, the less you will pay over time as interest accrues.
The checks could also go to back-owed rent, or to pay off auto loans or personal loans. People could also put the money towards student loans, although most payments are currently on pause due to the pandemic.
If you are going to invest your economic impact payment in the stock market, experts generally advise that you put that money into a well-balanced portfolio meant to grow over time. This could be in a retirement account or other investment account that's invested in a range of stocks and bonds, depending on your timeline.
""Invest your check today and let it sit for 20 years,"" said Stephanie Trexler, CFP, CEO and financial advisor at Golden Goose Wealth Planning in Grand Rapids, Michigan. ""That's going to pay a lot of dividends.""
It's also a much better bet than investing in a volatile single stock, where all your eggs are in one basket, Trexler said.
You could also put some of the money towards your or a child's future by investing it in an individual retirement account, a health savings account or even a 529 plan.
Investing in such accounts is another way to grow your money over the long term.
If you didn't make the maximum contribution to an IRA or HSA in 2020, you could put the money in such an account now, ahead of the deadline. If you have yet to file your 2020 taxes, this move could also potentially help you lower your adjusted gross income to qualify for other tax breaks.
If you are on solid ground with your finances including retirement savings and an emergency fund, you may also want to spend it.
""We get really caught up in just making sure money is being invested or used appropriately,"" said Jariwala. ""But, you know, we should also be rewarding ourselves for the hard work that we do.""
That might mean carving out some of the stimulus check to take a trip in the future or purchase an item you've been saving for.
The extra money could also be used for self-improvement, such as taking a class to build on a skill you already have or develop a new one.
""Find a therapist without worrying about the costs, because let's face it, it's been a rough year and anyone could use a friendly ear,"" said Goedtel. ""Whatever it is, the best investment you can make is in yourself.""
You could also use the money to help others.
One way is to spend your check boosting your local economy by shopping at small local businesses that might have been hit hard by the pandemic, such as restaurants. Or, you could donate all or a portion of your check to a local charity.

Here are the most important news, trends and analysis that investors need to start their trading day:
Dow and S&P 500 futures Friday added to Thursday's late-session comeback, which saw Wall Street break a two-day losing streak, putting the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 at about breakeven for the week. The Dow closed up 199 points, boosted by economic comeback stocks, after losing as much as 348 points earlier Thursday. Nasdaq futures turned lower Friday after the index closed slightly higher. However, it remained 1.8% lower for the week. The 10-year Treasury yield was up Friday but still below recent 14-month highs.
The Commerce Department on Friday morning reported that personal income in February dropped 7.1%, roughly matching expectations. Personal savings last month dropped 1%, also basically in line with estimates. Both income and savings figures were strong in January, as Americans received Covid stimulus checks approved in December. In the coming months, another round of direct payments to many Americans, approved in March, could start showing up in the data.
WeWork, which pulled its IPO in 2019 after a dwindling valuation and resignation of co-founder Adam Neumann, has reached a new deal to go public. The office-sharing company agreed on Friday to merge with special purpose acquisition company BowX Acquisition Corp. The transaction values WeWork at $9 billion, a fraction of its one-time valuation of around $47 billion. Following the announcement, shares of BowX rose 2.5% in Friday premarket.
GameStop shares jumped roughly 10% in Friday's premarket, the morning after snapping a five-session losing streak and closing 52% higher. There was no apparent news Thursday. GameStop has been the most high-profile ""meme stock,"" popular among retail traders on Reddit and other social media platforms. The stock lost about a third of its value Wednesday after the video game retailer delivered disappointing fourth-quarter results, failed to give in-depth detail about its digital turnaround plans, and acknowledged it's considering selling more stock.
The National Labor Relations Board told Tesla to make Elon Musk delete a tweet that was seen as threatening to labor organizers within the company. The independent federal agency also ordered Tesla to reinstate a fired employee, Richard Ortiz, a union advocate. Tesla must also compensate Ortiz for loss of earnings, benefits and adverse tax consequences that resulted from his termination. The NLRB decision was largely in line with an administrative law judge's ruling from 2019, which Tesla had appealed to the full board.
The Ever Given, a stranded mega container ship in the Suez Canal, is holding up an estimated $400 million per hour in trade, based on the approximate value of goods that move through the key waterway every day. That's according to shipping data and news company Lloyd's List. Lloyd's values the canal's westbound traffic at roughly $5.1 billion a day, and eastbound traffic at around $4.5 billion a day. The Suez Canal, which separates Africa from Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world.

The hedge fund at the center of the GameStop saga gained more than 20% in February, clawing back some of its losses from a brutal January, sources told CNBC's Leslie Picker.
Melvin Capital, which previously had a large bet against the video game retailer, saw a return of 21.7% in February, according to the sources. The fund declined by 53% in January during the dramatic short squeeze that sent GameStop and other stocks soaring.
The firm said in late January that it closed out its GameStop shorts as the stock climbed. Melvin's founder, Gabe Plotkin, was one of the people brought in to testify before Congress about the volatile market moves, along with Citadel's Ken Griffin and retail trader Keith Gill.
Melvin received new investments in its fund during the turmoil, with Citadel and Steve Cohen's Point72 injecting $3 billion.
Plotkin's hedge fund, like many others, will go short against a company. Short selling is a strategy in which investors borrow shares of a stock at a certain price on hopes that the market value will fall below that level when it's time to pay for the borrowed shares.
The high level of short positions in some stocks, including GameStop, was noticed by traders on social media sites like Reddit's WallStreetBets forum.
A surge of buying in GameStop and other names triggered short squeezes, which is the phenomenon that occurs where short sellers buy shares to cover their positions, forcing prices even higher. GameStop's share price went from under $20 to nearly $500 at one point before falling sharply.
Plotkin told the House Financial Services Committee last month that short sellers may have to change their strategies after retail traders appeared to spark a dramatic surge for some of their main targets.
""I think us at Melvin, we'll adapt and I think the whole industry will have to adapt,"" Plotkin said.
Melvin Capital declined to comment to CNBC.

Robinhood is redesigning some of its app features — most notably ditching its confetti animation —amid scrutiny over the popular stock trading company's so-called gamification of investing.
The free-stock trading pioneer, which is gearing up for its public debut, told CNBC the move is an effort to remove the ""distraction"" from its overall mission to ""democratize"" investing.
""In the past, we used the same confetti design to celebrate firsts with customers. Those included customers' first trades, their first steps with cash management, and successful referrals of friends and family. Now, we're introducing new, dynamic visual experiences that cheer on customers through the milestones in their financial journeys,"" Robinhood said in a blog post on Wednesday.
Robinhood, which is seen as a gateway for young investors to access the markets, has lowered the barrier to entry for millions of retail investors. The platform gained an estimated 6 million users in January and February alone, according to SimilarWeb.
However, lawmakers and regulators have accused Robinhood of being reckless toward its newbie investors by making light of decisions that involve real money.
Last year, Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint against Robinhood, citing the company's ""aggressive tactics to attract inexperienced investors, its use of gamification strategies to manipulate customers, and its failure to prevent frequent outages and disruptions on its trading platform.""
Robinhood told CNBC the confetti was simply about positive reinforcement to a generation of investors that has long been shut out of the public markets.
""We've also heard the criticism and we think that gets distracting when the focus starts to shift to some misconceptions, and that's what starts defining what you're doing,"" Madhu Muthukumar, head of product management at Robinhood told CNBC. 
""That's also a good sign to say 'hey, we should talk about this. We should talk about what it is we value and not let everyone guess,"" he said.
In an effort to combat some of the criticism, Robinhood is going with new imagery. 
The confetti with be replaced by the following image when a customer makes their first trade.
Earlier this year, Robinhood found itself in the middle of a firestorm amid the short squeeze in GameStop, which was partially fueled by Reddit-driven retail investors. 
At the height of GameStop's surge, Robinhood and other brokers restricted trading of certain securities due to increased capital requirements from clearing houses.
Last week, Robinhood filed confidential paperwork to pursue an initial public offering. CNBC reported earlier this month that Robinhood had chosen the Nasdaq for its IPO, according to sources familiar with the matter. Goldman Sachs has been advising the company on the IPO.

Carson Block defended the practice of short-selling Wednesday, telling CNBC it provides a crucial role in protecting investors by identifying companies that could be misleading investors.
""I got into this business 11 years ago by helping to eliminate a number of frauds from China that were listed in the U.S.,"" the founder of Muddy Waters Research said ""Squawk Box."" ""We have, globally, eight delistings of companies and two other regulatory actions that have led to sanctions. That to me seems to be pretty American when we're out there protecting investors.""  
Block has been a closely watched short seller ever since betting against Sino-Forest, which was ultimately delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2012, in the aftermath of Muddy Waters' 2011 report. It accused the Chinese timber firm of fraud. In 2018, plaintiffs in a civil case against Allen Chan, co-founder and CEO of Sino-Forest, were awarded billions of dollars in damages.
Last week, Block publicized his latest short position, accusing XL Fleet of exaggerating its sales pipeline to justify future revenue projections.
XL Fleet, which makes electrification drive systems to convert traditional commercial and municipal vehicles into hybrids, forcefully rejected the allegations from Muddy Waters in a statement Monday. Boston-based XL Fleet said the short-selling report ""contains numerous factual inaccuracies, misleading statements, and flawed conclusions.""
The practice of short selling — essentially a bet that a stock will fall —has come under scrutiny in the wake of the Reddit-fueled short-squeeze in GameStop that began in January. The video-game retailer's stock had massive short interest, which some retail investors realized and started to buy GameStop shares and call options that helped move the price upward.
Short-sellers borrow shares of a stock and then sell them back into the market, with the goal of purchasing them back later at a lower price. Then, they return the borrowed shares and profit off the difference. When the opposite happens, like with GameStop, shorts may seek to buy back the stock at current higher prices to limit their financial losses.
Hedge funds such as Melvin Capital that shorted GameStop believed the company's value would continue to fall as the brick-and-mortar retailer battled a shift toward e-commerce and more gamers turned to digital downloads instead of buying the physical disk. Melvin's founder, Gabe Plotkin, explained the firm's reasoning for shorting GameStop at a congressional hearing in February.
Block's Muddy Waters picks its short targets differently, often betting against firms it believes are misleading investors, rather than just having a languishing business in secular decline.
Another company Muddy Waters bet against was Luckin Coffee — announcing a short early last year, believing the Chinese firm was committing fraud. An internal investigation from Luckin Coffee later determined its chief operating officer fabricated sales, and the stock was eventually delisted from the Nasdaq months later.
Block, like all short sellers, has financial incentives for his target-stocks to fall and his firm's public disclosures of positions are known to move share prices, even if it may be just temporary. Because of that, some people criticize people like Block for going on television, for example, to discuss his firm's bearish bets.
Asked directly by CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin about those who want to place restrictions on short selling or contend that Block's public campaigns against companies is ""not the American way,"" Block pushed back.
""The other side of that is, my perspective is, you're effectively saying then well, 'Cheating, scamming, exaggerating and getting money for it is the American way,"" Block said, reiterating that ""if we're out there trying to expose and remove the economic incentives for a small number of people to take advantage of naiveté, that's American.""
The volatile action in GameStop and the role social media played in attracting retail investors to the heavily bet-against stock has raised questions about how short sellers will approach positions in the future. Plotkin, for example, told Congress he believes hedge funds will adapt their strategies to avoid being caught in such dramatic short squeezes again.
One firm, Citron Research, has already said it's pivoting away from publishing short-selling research in favor of seeking out long positions.
While Block said he thinks GameStop may have changed the dynamics in some ways, he said he first observed a noticeable change last year. One company Muddy Waters shorted ""ripped on us, and that was new,"" Block said.
""That told us there's a lot going on in the market that has nothing to do with fundamentals, and it's really technicals,"" he said. ""Coming into this year before GameStop, we were thinking a lot about flows and how passive [management] and ETFs are really warping markets, so when we saw GameStop, I think that's just the five-alarm fire saying that these markets are really divorced, in many cases, from the fundamentals of the underlying asset.""

Here are the most important news, trends and analysis that investors need to start their trading day:
Futures tied to major U.S. stock indexes were lower, pointing to the third straight losing day on Wall Street.
Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average pointed to a loss of about 50 points at the open. S&P 500 futures fell 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.2%. Big Tech, which got hit hard in the previous session amid rising bond yields, continued to trade in the red in the premarket. Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Alphabet and Netflix all dipped slightly in early trading.
Stocks posted heavy losses during Wednesday's regular trading as rising bond yields spooked investors. The S&P 500 dipped 1.3%, while the DJIA closed down 119 points, or 0.38% lower. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, falling 2.7% as tech names declined.Market-moving events on Thursday include Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at The Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit.
Investors will also get an update on the pace of the labor market recovery when first-time jobless claims data for the week ending Feb. 27 is released. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones are forecasting 750,000 first-time filers.
In the previous week, jobless claims reached 730,000, well below the 845,000 Dow Jones estimate. Continuing claims hit a fresh pandemic-era low just above 4.42 million.
President Joe Biden has backed a plan to cut the income caps for Americans to receive stimulus checks as part of the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package set to pass in the coming days, a Democratic source said Wednesday.
The structure would slash the direct payment income caps approved by the House. Under the lower chamber's bill, individuals making up to $100,000 (and joint filers earning up to $200,000) would have received some amount. Under the new plan, the phase-out levels for the $1,400 stimulus checks would be $75,000 in income for single filers, $112,500 for heads of households and $150,000 for joint filers.
The House is expected to approve the Senate's version of the bill next week.
Melvin Capital, the hedge fund that got burned by the massive GameStop short squeeze, posted a more than 20% return last month, sources told CNBC's Leslie Picker.
The hedge fund saw a return of 21.7% in February, after losing 53% in January during the dramatic short squeeze that sent GameStop and other stocks soaring.
The firm said in late January that it closed out its GameStop shorts as the stock climbed. Melvin's founder, Gabe Plotkin, was one of the people brought in to testify before Congress about the volatile market moves, along with Citadel's Ken Griffin and retail trader Keith Gill.
SpaceX's Starship prototype exploded shortly after landing for the first time following a high-altitude flight test.
The cause of Wednesday's explosion, or whether it was intentional, was not immediately clear. Elon Musk alternatively refers to explosions as ""RUDs,"" or Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly.
The company test flew Starship rocket Serial Number 10, or SN10. SpaceX aimed to launch the prototype as high as 10 kilometers, or about 32,800 feet altitude. There were no passengers onboard the rocket, which is a development vehicle and flies autonomously.

Here are the most important news, trends and analysis that investors need to start their trading day:
U.S. stock futures rebounded after investor David Tepper told CNBC on Monday that he's getting bullish on stocks and believes the recent rapid rise in bond market rates is set to stabilize. Dow futures turned higher and added more than 100 points. A drop in the Nasdaq was still indicated, but Nasdaq futures Monday were way off their lows.
Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, said Monday it's very difficult to be bearish on stocks right now and thinks the sell-off in Treasuries that has driven rates higher is likely over. Another bullish catalyst for stocks in the near term is the fiscal stimulus package that was just approved by the Senate, Tepper, whose comments have been known to move markets, told CNBC's Joe Kernen.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday all broke three-session losing streaks, with strong advances. For the week, the Dow and S&P 500 gained 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. However, the Nasdaq dropped 2% last week. The Dow and S&P 500 were up nearly 3% and 2.3%, respectively, since the beginning of the year. The Nasdaq was just above breakeven ahead of Monday's open.
Tesla turned higher in Monday's premarket after closing Friday below $600 per share for the first time since early December. The stock has lost a third of its value since its all-time intraday high in late January.
Senate passage of the $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill Saturday wasn't enough to put stocks in the green Monday as more economic stimulus on top of an already recovering economy continued to stoke inflation concerns. That's pushing bond yields higher Monday, with the 10-year Treasury yield trading around 1.6%, shy of Friday's one-year high. The 10-year yield has risen rapidly since the end of January, adding more than 0.5% in a little over a month.
The Democratic-held House aims to pass the Senate-approved Covid stimulus package on Tuesday and then send it President Joe Biden for his signature. The bill approved in the Senate on Saturday comes with a smaller, compromise federal unemployment benefits boost and without a federal minimum wage increase. The legislation includes direct payments of up to $1,400 to most Americans, which Biden said Saturday could start going out within two weeks.
Shares of Disney rose more than 2% in Monday's premarket trading after California officials on Friday cleared theme parks to open at reduced capacity on April 1. They closed nearly a year ago due to the pandemic. The order includes Disneyland in the southern part of the state, Comcast's Universal Studios Hollywood and others. Disney World in Florida and Universal Studios Orlando opened with capacity limits over the summer. Shares of Comcast, parent company of NBCUniversal and CNBC, fell in the premarket.
Shares of GameStop surged about 11% in Monday's premarket after Bloomberg reported that the company tapped board member Ryan Cohen to guide the video game retailer's transition to an e-commerce business. Cohen, a major GameStop investor and founder of online pet retailer Chewy, will lead a board task force on digital changes.
General Electric is nearing a $30 billion-plus deal to combine its aircraft leasing business with Ireland's AerCap Holdings, according to The Wall Street Journal. GE Capital Aviation Services is one of the world's biggest jet leasing companies and leases passenger aircraft made by companies including Boeing and Airbus. Shares of GE rose about13.5% in Monday's premarket. AerCap shares surged 12%.
Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, rose above $70 per barrel Monday for the first time in more than a year. The surge came after Saudi Arabia said Sunday that its Saudi Aramco facilities were targeted by missiles and drones. Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement claimed responsibility for the attack. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, also moved higher, trading above $66 at nearly a two-year high.

Check out the companies making headlines in midday trading. 
Costco – The retailer's share price rose less than 1% after the company said same-store sales jumped 16% during March. Costco said that online sales rose 57.7% year over year, while net sales for the retail month of March came in at $18.21 billion, up from $15.49 billion in the same period a year ago.
Constellation Brands – Shares of the spirits maker slid 4% despite Constellation Brands beating top and bottom line estimates during the fourth quarter. The company earned $1.95 per share on $1.95 billion in revenue. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv expected the company to earn $1.55 per share on $1.87 billion in revenue.
Box —Shares of the cloud company tanked more than 8% after announcing a new $500 million strategic investment in convertible preferred stock from KKR, which will mainly be used for a Dutch auction stock repurchase following fiscal first quarter of 2022 earnings.
F5 Networks — Shares of the application and delivery network company slipped 0.01% after Credit Suisse downgraded F5 Networks to neutral from outperform. The Wall Street firm said after F5 Network's 20% climb this year, it not longer warranted a buy rating at its current valuation.
GameStop — The video game retailer's share price dipped about 0.2% after the company announced that Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen would take on the chairman role. Cohen currently serves on the board of directors and has pushed to change GameStop's focus to e-commerce.
WW International – Shares of the weight management service company dropped about 5% after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to equal weight from overweight. The Wall Street firm cited the stock's big run-up over the past 12 months that pushed the price within about 5% of its price target. 
Bilibili – Shares of the video streaming company rose more than 2% after Bilibili denied a Reuters report that it's in talks to buy a 24% stake in Yoozoo Games. Reuters previously reported that Bilibili would buy Yoozoo Games' stake as well as its headquarters for about $765 million. 
– CNBC's Maggie Fitzgerald, Pippa Stevens and Jesse Pound contributed reporting.

Keith Gill, the Reddit trading crowd's favorite and the man who inspired the epic GameStop short squeeze, just doubled down on his bet on the video game retailer, forgoing millions of dollars in quick profit to ramp up his stake.
The investor, who goes by DeepF------Value on Reddit and Roaring Kitty on YouTube, exercised his 500 GameStop call options contracts as they expired on Friday, giving him 50,000 more shares at a strike price of just $12. If he had sold the options at Friday's price, he could have made more than $7 million on the bet.
On top of exercising these options contracts, Gill bought 50,000 more GameStop shares, bringing his total investment to 200,000 shares worth more than $30 million.
While he gave up the quick payday on this options trade, his long investment is now even more wildly profitable with his average cost at $55.17, according to Gill's latest update on Reddit's r/WallStreetBets forum Friday. GameStop closed Friday at $154.69, giving him a profit of nearly $20 million. (The post was not independently verified by CNBC so we are assuming that it is his actual account.)
Gill attracted an army of day traders who piled into the brick-and-mortar video game stock and call options, pushing the shares up 400% in a single week in January. GameStop is up 720% for the year.
The shares ticked slightly higher in after hours trading with some investors perhaps heartened that Gill exercised his call options to get even more long.
The investor was a former marketer for Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance. Through YouTube videos and Reddit posts, Gill encouraged a band of retail traders to squeeze out short selling hedge funds in GameStop.
The action got so wild at one point that brokerages including Robinhood had to restrict trading in the stock as it blew up their clearinghouse margin. The mania also led to a series of congressional hearings, featuring Gill, around brokers' practices and gamifying retail trading.
Gill owned 10,000 shares of GameStop at the end of 2020 and increased his holding to 50,000 shares in January and to 100,000 in mid-February. Judging from the updates he posted on Reddit, he never sold his GameStop stakes amid the monstrous short squeeze or in the aftermath.
The GameStop story is still far from over. Besides the scrutiny the saga brought on around retail trading, the company itself is in the middle of a transformation, hoping to capitalize on the massive rally in the stock price.
GameStop announced a $1 billion stock sale at the beginning of April to accelerate its e-commerce transition led by activist investor and board member Ryan Cohen, who is Chewy's co-founder. The company also hired former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

The GameStop frenzy in late January forced Wall Street to pay attention to retail investors like never before.
The r/WallStreetBets community piled into the video game retailer's stock and options, triggering a short squeeze and leaving short sellers with huge losses.
In the aftermath, Wall Street and news outlets dove deep into subreddit to understand how this happened. WallStreetBets' unique mix of self-deprecating, camaraderie and tongue-in-cheek humor captured and identified with the American public.
""In the way they define themselves, they are setting up 'this is who we are' and that can bring people in,"" College of Charleston communication professor Ryan Milner said. ""There really is a power in the collectivism happening on WallStreetBets.""
Here's an explainer on why these collective actions are becoming more common, the role memes play in these situations and what's next for retail investing.

Shares of GameStop pared their double-digit losses in volatile trading that occurred Monday morning after the video game retailer said it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares following a historic Reddit-fueled short squeeze.
GameStop closed down 2.4% to $186.95 a share. Earlier in the day, the company saw its shares drop as much as 14% after it announced a stock offering of up to 3.5 million shares. The company said it intends to use the proceeds to further accelerate its e-commerce transformation as well as for general corporate purposes and further strengthening its balance sheet. 
The offering is viewed as a way for the retailer to capitalize on its recent jaw-dropping rally prompted by a band of Reddit-obsessed retail traders who targeted heavily shorted stocks. GameStop surged 400% in a week in January to above $400 a share amid the massive short squeeze.
At the beginning of the year, GameStop, a brick-and-mortar retailer, traded at less than $20 a share.
GameStop is in the middle of a technology and e-commerce transition led by activist investor and board member Ryan Cohen, who was Chewy's co-founder. The company hired former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.
In a separate release on Monday, GameStop said its total global sales increased about 11% for the first nine weeks of fiscal 2021 from the same period a year ago. For the five-week period ended April 2, total global sales grew 18% year over year, the company said.
""The company has yet to show financial success in an industry that is rapidly shifting to digital,"" Joseph Feldman, analyst at Telsey Advisory Group, said in a note Monday. ""We continue to believe the current valuation far exceeds our rosy fundamental expectations and projected multi-year benefits from the strategic transformation.""
Two weeks ago, the company reported worse-than-expected fourth-quarter results that missed on the top and bottom lines. However, GameStop said its e-commerce sales jumped 175% last quarter and accounted for more than a third of its sales in the period.

GameStop rallied Monday after the video game retailer announced its CEO succession plan as it tries to pivot to e-commerce following a historic short squeeze.
Shares of GameStop jumped more than 6% to close at $164.37.
The company said CEO George Sherman will step down by July 31. It said the board is leading a search to identify CEO candidates who can accelerate the next phase of the company's transformation.
While GameStop shares are well below the record highs of $483 reached in January, the stock is still up a whopping 770% for 2021. To take advantage of the massive Reddit-fueled rally, GameStop announced a $1 billion stock sale earlier this month. It plans to use the sale's proceeds to aid its transition into e-commerce, which is led by activist investor and Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen.
The company also hired former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.
""GameStop's next CEO and CFO are likely to come from the tech industry, as with the other recent senior hires, and would require a wide range of strategic and operational experience, given GameStop's complex business model, including ~4,800 global stores, digital, used games, new software and hardware, and collectibles,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman wrote in a note.
Some investors also took comfort in Keith Gill doubling down on his GameStop bet. On Friday, he decided to forgo millions of dollars in quick profit from an options trade. Gill is perhaps the biggest influencer in the Reddit retail trading crowd.
The investor — who goes by DeepF------Value on Reddit and Roaring Kitty on YouTube — exercised his 500 GameStop call options contracts as they expired on Friday, giving him 50,000 more shares at a strike price of just $12. Gill could could have made more than $7 million on the bet if he had sold the options at Friday's price.
Gill also bought 50,000 more GameStop shares, bringing his total investment to 200,000 shares worth more than $30 million.
Gill's trading information is based on his Reddit posts, which appear to be snapshots of his investment account. The posts were not independently verified by CNBC.
Still, Wall Street analysts' consensus is that GameStop's stock price is significantly detached from fundamentals. Tesley maintained its underperform rating and 12-month price target of just $30 per share.
""We continue to believe the current valuation far exceeds our rosy fundamental expectations and projected multi-year benefits from the strategic transformation,"" Feldman said.

GameStop's stock price climbed on Tuesday after the video game retailer said it sold 3.5 million additional shares, raising $551 million to speed up the company's e-commerce transformation.
The stock, favored by the Reddit retail trading crowd, jumped more than 5% on Tuesday after gaining nearly 12% during Monday's regular trading hours. Shares are up nearly 850% this year.
GameStop announced the ""at-the-market"" stock offering at the beginning of April, which was viewed as a way to capitalize on its recent head-turning rally that made Wall Street history.
In late January, a band of Reddit-obsessed retail traders coordinated trades on heavily shorted stocks, created a massive short squeeze in GameStop, whose shares surged 400% at one point. The brick-and-mortar retailer traded at less than $20 a share at the start of 2021.
The company is now in the middle of a shift to e-commerce, spearheaded by activist investor and board member Ryan Cohen, who was Chewy's co-founder. 
Last week, GameStop announced its CEO George Sherman will step down by July 31. It said the board is leading a search to identify CEO candidates who can accelerate the next phase of the company's transformation.
The company also hired former Amazon and Google executive Jenna Owens as its new chief operating officer.

Trading apps aren't the only ones benefiting from the rise of meme stocks.
Betterment, a digital investment advisor, said it saw record growth in the first quarter of 2021. Despite offering so-called passive investing and not allowing clients to hand-pick stocks, Betterment's CEO, Sarah Kirshbaum Levy, said excitement around GameStop and ""gambling"" on markets during the Covid pandemic still boosted business.
""What it's done is shine a light on investing generally,"" said Levy, a former ViacomCBS chief operating officer, who took over the role in December. ""Strategically, we're very different from other players in the market, but we're a nice complement.""
In Betterment's first full quarter with Levy at the helm, its new clients and net deposits grew 116% and 118%, respectively. The firm added $10 billion in fresh customer assets, bringing its total under management to $29 billion.
The New York-based company was founded by former CEO Jon Stein in 2010, and offers retail investment advice, a platform for independent investment advisors, and 401(k) plans for small and medium-sized businesses. Its majority millennial clients use Betterment for ""long-term"" and ""safety-net"" investing, and often have more than one account, Levy said.
""They're having fun with someone else for day trading,"" she said in a phone interview.
Some of Betterment's robo-advisor competitors have seen similar growth this year.
Wealthfront told CNBC it saw the highest number of net deposits on record in March, and crossed $25 billion in assets under management in the quarter.
Investment app Acorns doubled its accounts from the fourth quarter to the first quarter for its best three months on record. Its assets topped $4.5 billion.
Free trading app Robinhood was at the center of the GameStop controversy amid a short squeeze in the stock, which was partially fueled by Reddit-driven retail investors. Still, it added 3 million customers in January alone, according to estimates from JMP Securities.
Charles Schwab on Thursday said it added a record 3.2 million new clients in the first quarter — more fresh accounts than in all of 2020. CEO Walt Bettinger credited ""heightened market attention to certain names via social media"" as one factor that ""significantly bolstered trading activity.""
Levy, who was also chief operating officer at Viacom's Nickelodeon unit, said she's looking to embrace the stock market's new intersection with social media. Betterment clients should be able to ride the viral stock wave safely, she said.
""We see the evolution of the space, and want people to experiment on the margin without losing their life savings,"" Levy said. ""I worry about volatility — some people aren't going to be able to dump their GameStop shares, and they're going to get burned if they don't have a safety net.""

Here are the most important news, trends and analysis that investors need to start their trading day:
Dow futures rose over 200 points Monday after Friday's blowout jobs report showing nonfarm payrolls had increased by 916,000 in March. That was much stronger than expected and the highest total since August, as states continued to reopen their economies one-year after the start of pandemic and Covid vaccinations ramped up. The 10-year Treasury yield ticked higher Monday but remained below its recent 14-month high. On Thursday, the week's last day of trading, the S&P 500 rose nearly 1.2%, closing above 4,000 for the first time ever. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5% but came up short of closing at a record. The tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.8%, moving within 4.6% of its February record close.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday will call for a minimum tax on corporations around the world in an effort to keep companies from relocating to find lower rates. ""We are working with G-20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom,"" Yellen will tell a conference held by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, according to a report from Axios confirmed by CNBC. President Joe Biden is looking to raise the U.S. corporate tax rate as a way to pay for a $2 trillion infrastructure improvement plan.
Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri is urging the president to cut his infrastructure plan to roughly $615 billion and to concentrate on rebuilding physical infrastructure like roads and bridges. The fourth-ranking GOP senator said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that only 30% of Biden's proposal focuses on traditional infrastructure. Blunt said that reducing the price would allow the White House to pass the bill through both chambers of Congress. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said last week the $2 trillion package would not receive Republican support.
GameStop dropped 13% in Monday's premarket after announcing plans to sell up to 3.5 million shares as the video game retailer looks to take advantage of its stock surge following a Reddit-driven trading frenzy earlier this year. GameStop said it would use the proceeds to speed up the shift in its business model to e-commerce. GameStop closed Thursday at $191 per share. It traded as high as $483 in late January. Before the Reddit trade took hold, the stock began the year under $20.
Tesla shares jumped more than 7% in the premarket after the electric automaker Friday said it delivered nearly 185,000 vehicles during the first quarter. That's a record for the company and above estimates for 168,000 deliveries. All of the vehicles produced during the quarter were Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover SUVs. Tesla did not produce any of its more expensive Model S sedans and Model X SUVs. However, it did deliver 2,020 Model S and Model X vehicles from inventory.
The U.S. put Johnson & Johnson in charge of the Emergent BioSolutions plant that ruined 15 million doses of the drugmaker's one-shot Covid vaccine, a senior health official said. The government also prohibited AstraZeneca from using the facility. Emergent BioSolutions workers at the plant in question mixed ingredients for the J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines, according to The New York Times. AstraZeneca, whose vaccine has not been approved in the U.S., said it will work with the Biden administration to find an alternate production site.

Hedge fund manager David Einhorn warned of dangers for retail investors that he sees in the market, and one of his main examples was a tiny New Jersey deli with a market capitalization of more than $100 million.
The Paulsboro, New Jersey-based Your Hometown Deli is the sole location for Hometown International, which has an eye-popping market value despite totaling $35,748 in sales in the last two years combined, according to securities filings.
""Someone pointed us to Hometown International (HWIN), which owns a single deli in rural New Jersey ... HWIN reached a market cap of $113 million on February 8. The largest shareholder is also the CEO/CFO/Treasurer and a Director, who also happens to be the wrestling coach of the high school next door to the deli. The pastrami must be amazing,"" Einhorn said in a letter to clients published Thursday.
Hometown, which appears to have begun trading in 2019, according to FactSet, has shares that trade over the counter and rarely has more than a few hundred shares change hands per day. Often, there are no trades logged in an entire trading day.
Still, the company's market cap is just over $100 million, according to FactSet.
Hometown did not immediately return a request seeking comment made to the phone number listed in the company's securities filings. A manager was not available to comment at the deli's phone number.
According to the company's latest 10-K filing, the company's single location was closed from March 23 to September 8 of last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. During that time, the company's stock price rose to $9.25 per share from $3.25 per share. It last traded at just under $14 per share.
The company sold 2.5 million shares last year and has about 60 total shareholders, according a filing.
Hometown reported more than $600,000 in expenses last year, up from about $154,000 in 2019. The company also reported a net cash gain of $2.2 million from financing activities, such as selling stock, in 2020.
Einhorn's highlighting of Hometown comes as politicians, regulators and high-profile investors have publicly fretted about the boom in certain types of stocks over the past year.
As a new wave of retail investors joined the market in recent months, special purpose acquisition companies have launched at a record pace and some stocks, like GameStop and Discovery, have seen wild swings after being bid up by traders on Reddit or hedge funds.
The over-the-counter stock market, often referred to as pink sheets and penny stocks, have historically been a risky place for investors. Shares of penny stocks have also soared in recent months.

Just when you think the GameStop mania is a tale from the past, meme stocks came back from the dead with a double-digit rally this week, as enthusiastic investors piled back into speculative assets with the market near record highs.
Shares of GameStop soared another 15.8% on Wednesday, pushing its gains this week to 37%. Another Reddit target, AMC Entertainment, rallied 19.2%, bringing its weekly advance to more than 60%. Other popular meme stocks BlackBerry and Bed Bath & Beyond rallied 9.9% and 11.6%, respectively, on Wednesday.
Strategists believe the recent run-up occurred as these speculative assets and others became oversold. Last week, bitcoin suffered a 30% one-day crash that spooked many on Wall Street and the cryptocurrency recouped some of the losses this week but trading remains volatile.
Meanwhile, the stock market, which came back near its record level recently amid reopening optimism, might have unleashed another wave of animal spirits and pulled some investors back into the riskiest parts of the market.
""I believe the bounce back in these thematic names are a function of two components: the oversold conditions that currently existed in GME & AMC due to the bitcoin pullback and profit taking,"" said Jeff Kilburg, chief investment officer and portfolio manager at Sanctuary Wealth.
""I also believe the newly injected investor confidence with U.S. equity markets hovering near all time highs makes a difference. High tide lifts all boats,"" Kilburg added.
In January, GameStop became the center of attention and sent shock waves across Wall Street. A band of retail investors coordinated trades on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum and managed to create a massive short squeeze, inflicting huge pain for short selling hedge funds in the name.
Back then, the day traders targeted names with elevated levels of short interest, including AMC, BlackBerry and Bed Bath & Beyond. When hated stocks like these suddenly turned higher in price, short sellers were forced to buy back borrowed shares to close out their short position and cut losses. The forced buying from short sellers then fueled the rally even further.
A short squeeze could be at play again for GameStop, although not in the same magnitude as before.
""We have started to see some short covering in GME as mark-to-market losses mount on the short side,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky of data firm S3 Partners. The recent rally in GameStop's stock has pushed mark-to-market losses for short sellers to more than $6.7 billion this year, according to data from S3 Partners.
GameStop and AMC still each have more than 20% of their float shares sold short, compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock, according to the data.
""Both stocks have a high potential for a short squeeze, dependent on their upcoming stock price moves,"" Dusaniwsky said.
GameStop, a brick-and-mortar video game retailer, is in a middle of an e-commerce transformation after the monstrous rally this year. Starting the year below $20, the stock shot to $483 a share at the end of January amid the historic short squeeze. The shares are still up 1,180% in 2021 and closed at $242.56 Wednesday.
AMC has gained 95% in May, bringing its 2021 advance to over 800%.

Tech-driven disruption in business is rarely a force for good or bad alone. Robinhood is a good example of the rocky, disruptive force that sits between the absolutes.
The brokerage industry disruptor exemplifies the way that technology can turn an industry with gatekeepers into a more open platform and force the established giants to innovate and expand. That is why Robinhood earned the top spot on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list, pressing Wall Street and investment giants to lower trading costs — in many cases, to nothing — and consolidate to better withstand an accelerating digital threat.
And this year, the company and its CEO, Vlad Tenev, were at the center of a stock market and cultural phenomenon. In January, conversation in Reddit's WallStreetBets forum about squeezing hedge fund investors drove the seemingly irrational buying up of GameStop and AMC Entertainment shares. That trading happened largely on Robinhood — and it wasn't the only volatile trade where Robinhood was a center of the action. Between January and February, the platform reported the addition of 6 million cryptocurrency accounts.
The Reddit uprising followed a year when millions of Americans stuck at home during the pandemic, many receiving stimulus checks, discovered Robinhood's easy access to retail trading and became first-time investors. Tenev told CNBC late last year it was seeing deposits equal to, or multiples of, stimulus check amounts. Retail trading grew to 23% of total trading volume by the end of December 2020, up from 13% of trades a year earlier.
Robinhood has stuck to one message throughout the growth and tumult, telling CNBC and others: ""Our mission is to democratize finance for all.""
Robinhood has had some positive, and profound, implications for the market. The company has removed barriers to trading by making investing commission-free and mobile-first. It has simplified investing, and made it more accessible and personal.
Robinhood says its tools are reaching a more diverse group of investors. Citing data from a survey it conducted in December among over 98,000 Americans, it says 16% of its customers come from the Hispanic community, compared with 7% at incumbent brokerages including Schwab, E-Trade, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade and Vanguard; and 9% are African American, compared with 3% at other brokers. And it is bringing in younger investors. The company says Gen Y and Gen Z comprise 70% of its users.
However, its claims of making investing ""less scary"" and ""easier to understand"" are likely to raise eyebrows among its many critics, including the Securities and Exchange Commission, Capitol Hill and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who says it is catering to a ""casino aspect"" in the recent market.

The company has drawn criticism for gamifying the serious business of investing, which puts at stake individual life savings. Critics say the app is designed more like a video game than an investing tool, and until recently, it sprayed virtual celebratory confetti on the screen for new user accounts.
In 2020, Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint against the company citing ""aggressive tactics to attract inexperienced investors.""
The company settled an SEC probe last December for $65 million, stemming from charges it misled investors about how it makes money, without admitting wrongdoing.
Robinhood's ability to offer free trading on the platform is enabled by a practice that continues to draw criticism after the SEC settlement, known as payment for order flow, in which brokers receive payments from dealers for routing trades to them. It is a practice used by many electronic brokers, but it has never been as closely scrutinized as during Robinhood's rise.
Internet giants like Facebook and Google have been dogged for years by criticism that their free services rely on users being ""the product.""
In Robinhood's case, the free trade is the product, and that has sparked concern of a conflict of interest, with the broker incentivized to drive the highest number of trades possible.
New SEC Chairman Gary Gensler is watching. ""These new tools, about props and leaderboards and behavioral ways to get individuals to trade more ... there is a bit of a conflict of interest. An app that says that they had zero commissions is earning revenue on your trading ... somebody is paying them for that order flow and paying them for that data,"" Gensler said in a recent CNBC interview, during which he noted that payment for order flow has been blocked in the U.K. and Canada.
At one point during the Reddit WallStreetBets phenomenon, the opposite of too much trading occurred — Robinhood curtailed its customers' ability to trade — but that resulted in another controversy for the company. Robinhood locked investors out of trading in some of the most contested stocks like GameStop and AMC and drew criticism for acting unfairly toward ordinary investors, including an uncommon alignment of talking points from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Ted Cruz. And it led some of the app's most fervent new investors to leave for brokerage competitors.
Tenev later explained that Robinhood was forced to slow trading because it didn't have enough cash to hedge against the risks. To keep the company operational, the company raised an emergency $1 billion from investors, followed by an additional $2.4 billion. In other words, at a peak of popularity and notoriety, Robinhood could have gone out of business. It was the confidence of its investors in its business model and potential that enabled the company — and its users — to trade another day.
Robinhood also faces multiple class-action lawsuits related to trading outages that occurred during the volatile market conditions of March 2020, which locked some traders out of Robinhood's platform during key movements in stock indexes.
The path to growth that Robinhood has experienced isn't always straight, or benign. Former No. 1 CNBC Disruptor 50 companies have generated business models that have far-reaching consequences in the economy, and in people's lives. Airbnb and Uber, in particular, have grown into giants with as much controversy as accolades. And the company that ignited the original idea for the CNBC Disruptor 50 list, Facebook, has been at the center of multiple cultural and political tugs-of-war for most of its still relatively short existence (i.e., is Facebook bringing people together or tearing them apart? Supporting democracy or undermining it?). All have benefited from laws and regulations that did not anticipate their disruptive innovations or were slow to react to it, and have ended up in prolonged battles with politicians and regulators.
In Robinhood's case, the past year's story is not without tragedy. A 20-year-old who thought he owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in a risky bet died by suicide after not being able to reach customer support. His family sued. The company committed to hiring hundreds of registered financial representatives to ensure customer questions are addressed quickly.
Its core model of commission-free trading is here to stay, and Robinhood continues to iterate and expand. The stocks, ETFs, options, and cryptocurrencies that its users are invested in are part of a new world where portfolios are checked on an iOS or Android device — sometimes without even opening the app.
In the first quarter of 2021, 9.5 million customers traded crypto on Robinhood Crypto, compared with 1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2020.
During historic market volatility early in the pandemic, Robinhood added a Market Volatility page to its help center, and the company fully rolled out recurring investments and access to fractional shares.
One thing is certain: Robinhood's appeal to a new generation of investors has forced the traditional Wall Street banks, asset managers and brokerage firms to take note. Goldman Sachs has been investing in its retail arm, Marcus, and Fidelity just launched ""youth accounts"" for teens to trade and save, commission-free, on its platform. E-Trade was acquired by Morgan Stanley, and TD Ameritrade by Charles Schwab. Even the firm synonymous with long-term buy-and-hold investing, Vanguard, now offers commission-free trading on many products.
Robinhood says it has 13 million users and its mission is ""to unlock a source of wealth for a new generation."" That figure has not been updated since 2020. Some more recent industry estimates put the number closer to 20 million users, but that could include some accounts that are not funded, and the company has not confirmed it.
Regulators remain wary of where its influence over the millions of new investors it has introduced to the market will end. The SEC's Gensler told CNBC bringing more access to the capital markets for retail investors is a good thing, as long as the core principles of protecting investors are not upended by apps that encourage active trading through behavioral prompts.
""Nobody really asks the question of, 'Is it too easy to buy a flat screen TV with one click and get it delivered?' But people are now asking the question of 'Should it be this easy and low friction for people to invest in the markets?' Tenev argued in a CNBC interview late last year.
""Our belief is, the more we lower the barriers to entry, the more we level the playing field and allow people to invest their money at a younger age, the better off our economy will be and the better off society will be because we kind of live in the intersection of capitalism, democracy and innovation,"" Tenev said. ""And I think that it's a very interesting place to be.""

Here are the most important news, trends and analysis that investors need to start their trading day:
U.S. stock futures were relatively flat Thursday, and the 10-year Treasury yield was higher, over 1.6%, after of a burst of morning economic data. The market saw modest gains Wednesday, supported by stocks tied to the economic reopening. The S&P 500 ended less than 1% from its May 7 record close. With two trading days left in May, the Nasdaq was up nearly 2% for the week but down 1.6% for the month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 were up for the week and the month.
Acorns said Thursday it will merge with with Pioneer Merger Corp., a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company. The SPAC deal values Acorns at roughly $2.2 billion, more than double its last private valuation. When the transaction is finalized, Acorns will trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol OAKS, a nod to the company's motto and analogy of growing acorns into ""mighty oaks."" Comcast's venture arm and NBCUniversal are investors in Acorns. Comcast also owns CNBC.
The government issued three key economic reports Thursday morning, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street.
This week's meme stock rally was set to take pause Thursday. Shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment, both popular with Reddit traders, were under pressure in the premarket. However, GameStop surged nearly 16% on Wednesday alone and almost 44% in the past month. AMC soared 19% on Wednesday and 70% over the past month. GameStop is up nearly 1,200% this year, including epic gains in January. AMC was up 822% year to date. Strategists attribute the recent runup in these stocks to being oversold.
Major bank CEOs are set to face a second round of grilling by lawmakers as they testify before the House Financial Services Committee. There were fireworks at the Senate Banking Committee's hearing Wednesday when progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren went after JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon. The Massachusetts Democrat called Dimon out over the bank's haul of nearly $1.5 billion in overdraft fees last year as borrowers struggled during Covid lockdowns. Dimon said JPMorgan waived overdraft fees for customers who requested relief. When asked whether the bank would refund the fees to those who didn't, Dimon said, ""No.""
President Joe Biden has ordered a closer intelligence review of what he said were two equally plausible scenarios of the origins of the coronavirus. Biden revealed that earlier this year, he asked the intelligence community to assess ""whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal, or from a laboratory accident."" The hypothesis that the virus may have escaped from a Chinese lab has gained more mainstream traction in recent months. CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in Senate testimony last week that a lab-leak origin was ""one possibility."" China has dismissed the lab theory.

New Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler will testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Thursday. 
It's the third House hearing focused on GameStop, but Gensler's first appearance as chairman before the committee.
Gensler's prepared testimony indicates he will address a broad range of topics around GameStop and protection of investors, including:
Gensler will begin his testimony on the increasing gamification of trading, which he defined as trading that has ""game-like features"" — such as points, rewards, leaderboards, bonuses and competitions — to increase engagement.
""Many of these features encourage investors to trade more,"" Gensler said. ""Some academic studies suggest more active trading or even day trading results in lower returns for the average trader.""
Gensler said he has asked his staff to prepare a request for public input: ""We need to ensure investors using apps with these types of features continue to be appropriately protected.""
Many brokers now send their orders to market makers in exchange for payments, a process known as ""payment for order flow.""  The market makers can either execute the orders directly or pass it on to an exchange or other trading venues.
Because higher levels of trading generate more payment to brokers, Gensler asked, ""Do broker-dealers have inherent conflicts of interest? If so, are customers getting best execution in the context of that conflict? Are broker-dealers incentivized to encourage customers to trade more frequently than is in those customers' best interest?""
Gensler did not directly address these questions but implied the recent enforcement action against Robinhood was a warning sign. ""Robinhood explicitly offered to accept less price improvement for its customers in exchange for receiving higher payment for order flow for itself. As a result, many Robinhood customers shouldered the costs of inferior executions; these costs might have exceeded any savings they might have thought they'd gotten from a zero commission.""
That payment for order flow has turned into a lucrative business. Gensler says about 38% of equity trading volume is executed by those off-exchange wholesalers. Citadel Securities, Gensler noted, has publicly stated that it executes about 47% of all retail volume.
Gensler asked if this concentration was consistent with the SEC's mandate to promote fair, orderly, and efficient markets. ""History and economics tell us that when markets are concentrated, those firms with the greatest market share tend to have the ability to profit from that concentration,"" he said, ""I've asked staff to look closely at these issues to determine which policy approaches may be merited.""
Citadel Securities declined to comment. However, in testimony in February in the House, Citadel founder Ken Griffin said: ""With respect to payment for order flow, we simply play by the rules of the road. Payment for order flow has been expressly approved by the SEC. It is a customary practice within the industry. If they choose to change the rules of the road, we need to drive on the left side versus the right side, that's fine with us.""
Hedge funds and other investors who hold significant stock positions are required to report long positions on a quarterly basis, but those who hold short positions are not. 
That has led to calls that short sellers should also be required to disclose their positions: ""Enhancing disclosures could improve market efficiency and end some wild speculation (and misinformation) about short selling and short positions,"" Healthy Markets executive director Tyler Gellasch said in an open letter to Gensler.
Gensler told the committee he has directed SEC staff to prepare recommendations for the agency's consideration on short selling disclosure.
Though unrelated to GameStop, Gensler also brought up the failure of Archegos Capital Management and the losses incurred by several banks that provided prime brokerage services to them. The ""core"" of the problem, Gensler said, was Archegos' use of total return swaps based on underlying stocks, and the significant exposure that the prime brokers had to the family office.
Gensler said he has asked his staff for recommendations on whether to include total return swaps and other security-based swaps under new disclosure requirements. 
Gensler also raised concerns that wrongdoers will attempt to use social media to hype stocks or manipulate markets. He offered no specific suggestions but said that ""this is an area for which we will continue to deepen our understanding, resources, and capabilities.""
Gensler noted that ""at least one firm didn't have sufficient liquidity to meet margin calls and had to fundraise within hours to meet $1 billion-plus obligations, and several brokers chose to shut down customer access to trading."" Gensler said this raised questions about whether margin requirements are sufficient and whether broker-dealers have appropriate tools to manage their liquidity and risk. ""I've asked staff to look at these issues carefully,"" he said.
Stocks currently take two days after a trade is made to settle, a convention known as ""T + 2.""  Gensler noted that ""the longer it takes for a trade to settle, the more risk our markets assume"" and that the technology exists to eventually shorten the settlement cycle to T + 1 or even same-day settlement. ""I've directed the SEC staff to put together a draft proposal for the Commission's review on this topic,"" he said.
While Gensler's statement lacked specifics, analysts noted that his comments clearly indicated his policy direction.
""This is the first time he has come out, and he is pretty negative on payment for order flow and the concentration of market makers,"" Piper Sandler's Rich Repetto told me, noting his remarks were ""troublesome for e-brokers and market makers.""
Repetto also said not to mistake the lack of specifics for lack of direction. ""When he says he is 'directing' his staff he is implying there is going to be some kind of action,"" Repetto said, noting that the committee will now expect some kind of update in coming months on what the SEC is doing.
Indeed, Gensler told the committee his staff would be publishing a report on market events over the summer.
Gensler also left the door open to enforcement actions against those violating SEC rules.
""While I cannot comment on ongoing examination and enforcement matters, SEC staff is vigorously reviewing these events for any violations,"" he said. ""I also have directed staff to consider whether expanded enforcement mechanisms are necessary.""

Fidelity Investments is lowering the barrier to entry into the stock market for a new cohort: teenagers.
The investing firm is launching the Fidelity Youth Account, an investing and savings account for 13- to 17-year-olds. The no-fee account will allow teenagers to buy and sell stocks, ETFs and Fidelity mutual funds.
The accounts, which Fidelity calls the first of their kind in the industry, are only available to teenagers with a parent who also has a Fidelity account. Fidelity is pitching the venture as an educational opportunity, where parents can monitor their child's activity.
Younger investors have been entering the stock market in droves in the past year as the Covid-19 pandemic created a unique climate for retail investors. Millions of new clients traded the epic market comeback from the coronavirus recession in 2020 and stuck around for an epic short squeeze in GameStop in January.
The rush of new young investors has not come without negative implications, though, critics argue. The popularity of stock trading app Robinhood — which requires investors to be 18 or older to use its services — has been criticized as helping to start bubbles in the so-called meme stocks such as GameStop, as well as cryptocurrencies. However, Robinhood is not the only brokerage going after younger generations.
Of the 4.1 million new accounts that Fidelity added in the first quarter of 2021, 1.6 million were opened by retail investors 35 and younger, an increase of more than 222% from a year prior.
Fidelity's new youth account, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, will offer clients a debit card with no minimum investment at account opening.
Young investors are not allowed to trade options and are not allowed to trade on margin, according to Fidelity chief marketing officer David Dintenfass. 
Dintenfass said during the pilot program about 30% of teenagers were trading stocks. The group that traded, invested in bigger equities like the S&P 500 index fund, Apple and Tesla. 
""Our goal for the Fidelity Youth Account is to encourage young Americans to learn through action and foster meaningful family conversations around financial topics,"" said Jennifer Samalis, senior vice president of acquisition and loyalty at Fidelity Investments, in a press release.
When the teenager reaches the age of 18, the account will transition to a standard brokerage account.
As of the first quarter, Fidelity has 83.4 million total accounts and $10.4 trillion assets under administration.

Shares of AMC Entertainment soared again on Thursday as speculative trading activity skyrocketed in the movie theater chain's stock among Reddit-obsessed day traders.
The stock surged as much as 47% Thursday and ended the session 35.6% higher at $26.52, pushing its week-to-date advance to nearly 120%.
AMC has overtaken GameStop to become the most-loved stock in the infamous WallStreetBets Reddit forum, according to Bank of America's analysis of stock mentions on the platform.
With its massive rally on Thursday, AMC has diverged from its meme stock peer GameStop, which made Wall Street history in January with its 400% short squeeze in a single week. Shares of GameStop were up a much smaller 4.8% Thursday after rallying 15% in the previous session.
One of the trending posts on the WallStreetBets chatroom Thursday said, ""AMC rocket ship,"" while another said, ""invested all my savings into AMC!!! Wish me luck guys.""
The so-called short covering could be contributing to AMC's massive rally this week. The company has about 20% of its float shares sold short, compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock, according to data from S3 Partners.
""AMC short sellers have been covering some of their exposure lately reversing their short selling trend earlier in the month,"" said Ihor Dusaniwsky of S3 Partners.
When a heavily shorted stock jumps higher in a rapid fashion, short sellers are forced to buy back borrowed shares to close out their short position and cut losses. The forced buying tends to fuel the rally even further.
Short sellers betting against AMC have incurred a $1.3 billion loss this week alone, according to the data.
Wall Street analysts have been baffled about the more than 1,200% jump in AMC's stock since January. The company, which has around $5 billion in debt and $450 million in deferred lease repayments, has seen revenue slashed significantly due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
While the movie theater business is rebounding, AMC is still facing steep headwinds. Though the company ended the first quarter with $1 billion in liquidity, the most it's ever had in its 100-year history, that cash on hand will only keep AMC stay afloat through 2022. The movie theater chain will also need audiences to return to cinemas in droves to make up for months of no revenue.
While initial box-office receipts are promising, fundamental elements of the movie theater business have changed in the last year, including theater capacity, shared release dates with streaming services and the number of days that movies play in theaters.
For the first quarter, AMC posted $148.3 million in revenue, down 84.2% from the same period a year ago. Its net loss shrank to $567.2 million, or $1.42 per share in the quarter, from a loss of $2.18 billion, or $20.88 per share, a year earlier.
Despite generating significantly lower revenue in 2021, AMC's valuation has nearly tripled thanks to these new retail investors. On the last day of 2019, AMC had an enterprise value of $5.8 billion, on Wednesday, that value stood at around $13.4 billion.

Shares of AMC Entertainment gyrated on Friday as speculative trading activities continued to escalate.
The stock closed down 1.5% after rallying as much as 38% earlier Friday. Despite the intraday reversal, shares advanced more than 116% week to date, bringing its monstrous 2021 rally to 1,132%.
More than 650 million AMC shares changed hands on Friday, far surpassing its 30-day trading volume average of 106 million. 
AMC was the most active stock on the New York Stock Exchange by far on Thursday with nearly 700 million shares changed hands. The stock recorded its highest trading volume of 1.25 billion shares on Jan. 27.
""The retail trader is at it again,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. ""AMC500k and AMCSqueeze were trending on Twitter yesterday and that momentum took the stock price above the end of January high that we saw during the peak of meme stock mania."" 
The movie theater chain has replaced GameStop as the most popular stock in the infamous WallStreetBets Reddit forum, according to Bank of America's analysis of stock mentions on the chat page.
Enthusiastic Reddit traders are encouraging each other to double down on AMC's stock and call options by sharing screenshots of their portfolio and touting massive return. One trending post on WSB Friday reads: ""$AMC YOLO UPDATE : 4948 shares, 10 calls, across 4 brokerages, and I still ain't selling!""
GameStop, which was the star of the show amid the January retail trading mania,  fell 12% Friday and cut its weekly gain to 25%. AMC's 2021 gains also exceeded GameStop's 1,078%.
AMC's surge this week inflicted a $1.2 billion loss for short sellers, according to data from S3 Partners.
Short covering could be fueling AMC's massive rally this week. When a heavily shorted stock jumps higher, short sellers are forced to buy back borrowed shares to close out their short position and cut losses. The forced buying tends to accelerate the rally even further.
AMC is a heavily shorted name, with about 20% of its float shares sold short, compared with an average of 5% short interest in a typical U.S. stock, according to S3 Partners.
While its business started to recover amid the economic reopening, AMC is still facing steep headwinds, including theater capacity and the competition from streaming services.
The company, which has around $5 billion in debt and $450 million in deferred lease repayments, has seen revenue slashed significantly due to the coronavirus pandemic.
""All that really matters here long term, this company is never going to make cash again,"" Rich Greenfield, co-founder of LightShed Partners, said Friday on CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" ""They will never generate cash with their current capital structure. It traded at 7 times EBITDA pre-pandemic. It's now trading at 25 times EBITDA right now and it's in a worse position today with the changed industry. This just defies all logic.""

"Ethereum co-founder on why he got into crypto: Empower the little guy, 'screw' the big guy — 'they already have enough money'",https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/18/why-ethereum-founder-vitalik-buterin-got-into-crypto-bitcoin.html,"Tue, 18 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNBC,"
Before Vitalik Buterin co-created Ethereum, he first learned about bitcoin in 2011, when he was 17 years old.
Initially he dismissed it, but Buterin eventually connected with the idea of bitcoin after a second look, he told Wired in 2016. Like many bitcoin evangelists, Buterin, a Russian-Canadian programmer, was curious about the decentralized payment system.
Back then, ""I had a much more cartoon mentality,"" he told Wired.
""I saw everything to do with either government regulation or corporate control as just being plain evil. And I assumed that people in those institutions were kind of like Mr. Burns [on ""The Simpsons""], sitting behind their desks saying, 'Excellent. How can I screw a thousand people over this time.'""
Though his take on good and evil ""substantially updated"" as time went on, he told Wired, Buterin still felt motivated to get involved with bitcoin to adjust the balance of power between ""the big guy"" and ""the little guy.""
""I think a large part of the consequence is necessarily going to be disempowering some of these centralized players to some extent,"" he said in 2016.
""Because ultimately power is a zero sum game. And if you talk about empowering the little guy, as much as you want to couch it in flowery terminology that makes it sound fluffy and good, you are necessarily disempowering the big guy. And personally, I say screw the big guy. They have enough money already.""
It's a mindset held by many who were drawn to the crypto space early on — and is especially relevant now.
Meme stocks and cryptocurrencies have become prevalent this year, with many in the space citing the same opinion Buterin talked about. Starting in January, retail investors on Reddit planned to help drive the price of GameStop stock after it was bet against by Wall Street hedge funds, calling their campaign as a ""great wealth redistribution."" Since, cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have reached record-highs with supporters rallying behind the decentralized system.
""I thought [bitcoin] was something really interesting,"" Buterin told Business Insider in 2019. ""I started getting into the community more and more.""
Seeing value in the space, Buterin co-founded Bitcoin Magazine in September 2011 while in college. There, he became an expert on bitcoin and learned what could make the blockchain better.
In May 2013, Buterin attended a bitcoin conference that convinced him to pursue development of the cryptocurrency full-time, and by the end of the semester, he had dropped out of school to do so.
For six months in 2013, Buterin traveled around the world to meet with bitcoin developers. He realized that he could iterate on the bitcoin blockchain to create a new, potentially better, one.
Bitcoin had ""too limited functionality,"" he told Business Insider.
To explain his thinking, Buterin compared bitcoin to a pocket calculator and a new potential blockchain to a smartphone.
""A pocket calculator does one thing and it does one thing well, but really, people want to do all these other things. And if you have a smartphone, then you have a pocket calculator as an app,"" he said. ""So basically, taking that same kind of idea of increasing the power of the system by making it more general purpose and applying it to blockchains.""
As a result, he came up with Ethereum, the blockchain that powers the cryptocurrency ether. (He wrote its white paper in November 2013 when he was just 19.)
Bitcoin is known for its peer-to-peer payment system, whereas Ethereum is capable of more than solely transactions — it can power and build decentralized applications, like financial tools and social media platforms, along with NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, due to its smart contracts.
""When I came up with Ethereum, my first first thought was, 'OK, this thing is too good to be true and I'm going to have five professional cryptographers raining down on me and telling me how stupid I am for not seeing a bunch of very obvious flaws,'"" Buterin told Wired in 2016. ""Two weeks later I was extremely surprised that none of that happened.""
Today, ether is the second largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin and has a current market value of over $400 billion.
Buterin recently became the world's youngest crypto billionaire at 27. On Wednesday, he donated over $1 billion to the India Covid-19 Relief Fund and other charities.
A representative for Buterin declined CNBC Make It's request for comment.

Robinhood's list of recent challenges are hard to count on one hand. Yet the popular stock-trading app is growing faster than ever and is on track for a multibillion-dollar IPO in the coming months. 
In the past year, Robinhood has navigated a congressional grilling, trading outages and ensuing customer backlash. It has engaged in spats with regulators and two of the most famous investors on the planet, Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. 
Still, Robinhood is one of the fastest-growing fintech start-ups and has risen to become one of Silicon Valley's most valuable private unicorns — and it is this year's No. 1 CNBC Disruptor 50 list company. Robinhood is valued at $11.7 billion, with its biggest backers including Sequoia Capital and Andreessen Horowitz, NEA, Kleiner Perkins and Google-parent Alphabet's venture capital arm, GV. Its IPO debut is expected to garner a valuation at least three-times that amount, sources told CNBC. Ahead of a public offering, the company has added top executives with experience from Google, Facebook, Amazon and the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Kathleen Smith, principal at IPO research and investing firm Renaissance Capital, said her firm has been comparing Robinhood to other brokerage firms such as Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers and Tradeweb, as well as analogues such as Social Capital, Lemonade and Coinbase. With the exception of Coinbase, which has been caught up in the crypto trading following its debut, ""most of these stocks have traded well year to date, despite a pullback in April and May,"" she said.
""We expect investors will be interested in this one including, the Robinhood account holders themselves,"" Smith added.
Robinhood may give people investing on the app early access. Last week, the start-up said it will give amateur investors access to initial public offering shares.
The Menlo Park, California-based company pioneered free stock trading. It was the major catalyst for online brokerage firms slashing commissions, then adjusting to zero-commission trades, now a standard in the industry. Robinhood offers equity, cryptocurrency and options trading, as well as some bank-like cash management products.
""Through Robinhood, millions of everyday people have the opportunity to participate in our financial markets,"" Robinhood CEO and co-founder Vlad Tenev told CNBC in an email. ""We're proud to be opening up access to wealth creation for people previously left behind, and we remain committed to democratizing finance for all.""
Meet the 2021 CNBC Disruptor 50 companies
Why Robinhood is No. 1 and ready to go public

How we choose Disruptor companies
The app was started in 2013 by Tenev, now CEO, and Baiju Bhatt. The duo met at Stanford and went on to start an algorithmic trading company, and later a financial software company that worked with major banks. Robinhood — their third start-up — was named after the English folklore outlaw, who stole from the rich and gave to the poor, in a nod to the company's motto of ""democratizing"" markets. 
Robinhood built a mobile stock-trading platform at seemingly the perfect time, with iPhones and Android devices becoming ubiquitous and making its sleek interface an attractive venue for a mobile-savvy generation. The stock market, meanwhile, has recovered from its pandemic-lows and continues its decade-plus bull run.
During the pandemic, Robinhood saw record growth along with the rest of the brokerage industry as new investors entered the market. Social media made stocks a form of entertainment for many while professional sports were on hold, and people had more free time while working from home, as well as stimulus checks to invest for those fortunate enough to not be living on the financial edge.
The largest valuation risks in a potential Robinhood IPO include the sustainability of a recent resurgence in trading activity, and regulators taking another look at Robinhood's key revenue source of payment for order flow.
Robinhood has mastered growing a customer base though nontraditional marketing. But bringing in a flood first-time investors could also elevate risks related to customer retention amid market volatility if portfolios turn negative — particularly with complex products such as options, leverage and trading on margin.
Michael Wong, director of equity research for the financial services sector at Morningstar, said Robinhood's IPO may be timed to take advantage of the bull market in stocks before it ends, and before regulators make any decisions related to payment for order flow. a key revenue source for the company. Wong, however, is less concerned about the retail investing phenomenon being temporary.
""We may be in a renaissance of retail investor interest in the market that hasn't been seen since the 1990s. However, this resurge in interest will likely have a happier ending than the tech bubble,"" Wong said. ""Outside of a relatively small pocket of stocks, the market as a whole doesn't seem to be significantly overvalued. While overtrading from zero-commissions may be a problem, more and younger people becoming interested in their finances should be beneficial in the long run.""
Some financial watchdogs and market participants worry that it's too entertaining. 
Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint against Robinhood, accusing it of failing to act in the best interests of its clients and using ""aggressive tactics to attract inexperienced investors, its use of gamification strategies to manipulate customers, and its failure to prevent frequent outages and disruptions on its trading platform.""
The world's most-famous investor, Warren Buffett, said recently that Robinhood is promoting gambling-like behavior and has ""become a very significant part of the casino aspect, the casino group, that has joined into the stock market in the last year or year and a half."" 
His longtime Berkshire Hathaway investing partner, Charlie Munger, added that the app has created ""a culture which encourages as much gambling in stocks by people who have the mindset of racetrack bettors"" and called it ""a dirty way of making money.""
Robinhood responded to criticism from Buffett and Munger, saying the two ""insulted a new generation"" of investors with ""elitist"" comments.
Part of the pushback from critics stems from Robinhood's business model.
In order to offer free trading, Robinhood and the majority of the brokerage industry make money off of payment for order flow. It routes customer trades to high-frequency trading companies such as Virtu and Citadel Securities, which pay Robinhood to execute that trade. Robinhood makes a commission on the back end, without charging customers upfront.
Payment for order flow, in tandem with heightened trading volumes, has played a substantial role in ""filling the zero commission revenue hole,"" according to a recent report from Piper Sandler brokerage sector analyst Rich Repetto. A subsequent review he conducted of first quarter 2021 brokerage regulatory reports shows that payment for order flow hit a record level across the board for electronic brokers. He noted brokerage firms believe PFOF is a ""disclosed, well vetted & scrutinized processes (by regulators)"" and part of providing the best trading experience to retail investors.
Robinhood has repeatedly said it gives customers the best price, and denies any conflict of interest within the arrangement. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler has said it's something that the agency is paying attention to.
A Robinhood spokesperson said the firm is ""fully transparent"" in its communications with customers over its current revenue streams and has improved its best execution processes.
Robinhood is dealing with multiple class-action lawsuits after trading outages in March 2020. While the Dow was experiencing major moves, some traders were locked out of Robinhood's platform. It has also had to content with criminals looking to exploit the retail trading boom by selling log-ins for accounts at Robinhood and other major brokerages, according to security analysts and listings seen by CNBC. 
A Robinhood spokesperson said the start-up had seen instances of accounts targeted by bad actors this year, but hacks did not stem from a breach of Robinhood's systems.
Most recently, Robinhood came under fire from lawmakers and some users after it and other brokers restricted the buy-side of trades for volatile stocks, such as GameStop, in late January. A handful of Robinhood's clients who couldn't get in touch with customer service during the chaos even drove to the start-up's headquarters in California, demanding to speak to a representative and in some cases, vandalizing the property, according to police reports.
GameStop's stock price had soared in January after traders on Reddit pushed one another to keep doubling down on buying shares, inflicting pain on hedge funds who had taken the other side of the trade by shorting it. Some accused Robinhood of colluding with hedge funds to make sure their losses didn't snowball. Robinhood said it did not shut down trades because of any outside pressure, and needed to cap trading due to unprecedented collateral requirements from its clearing house. 
Celebrities, including rapper Ja Rule, were tweeting #deleteRobinhood. Lawmakers from both major parties criticized Robinhood during those GameStop restrictions. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., a progressive who represents Silicon Valley, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., all blasted the company's decision. CEO Vlad Tenev later appeared in front of Congress to answer questions about it in a five-hour hearing.
During that turmoil, Robinhood was experiencing eye-popping user growth.
It soared to the top app in the iOS app store for multiple days during the GameStop frenzy and led the industry in downloads with 600,000 people downloading the free-trading app in a single day, according to JMP Securities. During January, JMP estimated that Robinhood added 3 million users.
As a result, venture capital investors rushed to fund Robinhood as it had to come up with billions of dollars to meet capital requirements. Robinhood raised over $3 billion in a matter of days.  
Robinhood has been well positioned for volatility in the cryptocurrency markets, too. Robinhood Crypto has added 3 million customers per month this year. The company reported that in the first quarter of 2021, 9.5 million customers traded crypto on Robinhood Crypto, compared with 1.7 million a year earlier. That part of the businesses also saw outages as investors poured into dogecoin.
The company has acted recently to smooth out some of the criticism. Robinhood added a support number, beefed up customer service hiring, and increased its margin requirements after a young customer died by suicide and the family sued the company.
After eight years as a private company, Robinhood filed the necessary paperwork in March to go public. Sources have told CNBC it has chosen the Nasdaq as its exchange. It remains on track for an IPO and has built out its executive teams with both Wall Street and Silicon Valley veterans.
Robinhood hired Aparna Chennapragada, who spent 12 years at Google leading product, engineering and design teams in March. It brought on former SEC commissioner Dan Gallagher last year as head of legal, and its first chief marketing officer, Christina Smedley, came from Facebook. Robinhood's CFO Jason Warnick joined after two decades at Amazon, and its chief operating officer, Gretchen Howard, is a former Google executive.

GameStop's sales rose 25% in the fiscal first quarter, as the video game retailer embarks on a turnaround strategy partially fueled by a Reddit-inspired stock rally. The company also named former Amazon executive Matt Furlong as its new CEO.
Shares fell more than 12% in extended trading on Wednesday, after the company declined to provide an outlook for the year and said it may sell as many as 5 million shares.
Here's how the company did for the fiscal first quarter ended May 1, compared with Refinitiv consensus estimates:
In the quarter, GameStop reported that its net loss narrowed to $66.8 million, or $1.01 per share, from a loss of $165.7 million, or $2.57 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company had a loss of 45 cents per share. Analysts were expecting GameStop to report a loss of 84 cents per share, according to Refinitiv.
Total revenue grew to $1.28 billion from $1.02 billion a year earlier, topping Wall Street's expectations of $1.16 billion.
The company declined to provide a forecast for the year. It said sales momentum continued into the second quarter, with total sales in May increasing about 27% compared with the same month a year ago.
GameStop filed a prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell up to 5 million shares of its stock from time to time, in ""at-the-market"" offerings. The funds it raises through these stock sales will be used for general corporate purposes, investing in growth initiatives and strengthening its balance sheet, the company said.
As of May 1, GameStop said, it had paid off its long-term debt and no longer had any borrowings under its asset-based revolving credit facility.
The video game retailer's stock has gyrated wildly over the past several months as retail traders have shared tips on Reddit and tried to fuel short squeezes for companies including GameStop, AMC Entertainment, Bed Bath & Beyond and Clover Health — collectively the group has become known as meme stocks.
GameStop's shares are up 1,506% so far this year. Its shares have swung from a 52-week low of $3.77 to a 52-week high of $483. As of Wednesday's close, shares were $302.56. Its market value is $21.41 billion.
The trading frenzy has gotten the attention of the SEC. In a filing Wednesday, GameStop said it had received a request from the SEC on May 26 to voluntarily provide documents and information. The company said it was reviewing that request and planned to cooperate.
GameStop has tried to catch investors' attention in other ways, as it focuses more on e-commerce and poaches talent from other companies. This spring, it tapped Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen to lead efforts to grow the online business. He was named chairman at a shareholder meeting Wednesday. The company also hired several former Amazon executives, including Jenna Owens, its new chief operating officer; Matt Francis, its first chief technology officer; and Elliott Wilke, its chief growth officer.
Yet some analysts are unconvinced that the longtime brick-and-mortar retailer can pivot its business and believe the company has been propped up by speculation.
Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba dropped his coverage of GameStop earlier this year following the Reddit frenzy. He told CNBC that the video game retailer's challenges run deep regardless of who it hires. 
""It's great that these guys worked at Amazon. Amazon is a very successful retailer that I do cover, that I'm very familiar with, but at the end of the day, GameStop's problems have very little, if anything, to do with e-commerce,"" Chukumba said on CNBC's ""Closing Bell."" 
""Their problem is not that they're not a good omnichannel retailer. The problem is that gamers are increasingly downloading video games,"" he added. ""Look, they can hire Jeff Bezos when he comes back from space. ... It's not going to make a difference. The symptoms are not aligned with the medicine that the doctor is giving them. You can hire anyone you want from Amazon — not going to make a difference.""

Correction: GameStop named former Amazon executive Matt Furlong as its new CEO. An earlier version of this story misstated his first name.

GameStop shares climbed after the video game retailer said it sold 5 million additional shares, raising $1.13 billion in capital to accelerate growth.
The original Reddit-favorite meme stock jumped as much as 12.7% Tuesday after the company announced the completion of its at-the-market equity offering program that was initially disclosed on June 9. By afternoon, the daily gain was 10%. GameStop said it will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes as well as for investing in growth initiatives and maintaining a strong balance sheet.
This is the second stock sale that GameStop has conducted since the company became a star on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, where retail traders aimed to push stock prices higher and squeeze out short-selling hedge funds. GameStop sold 3.5 million additional shares in April and raised $551 million.
Investors have been encouraged by the moves and looked past the dilution of their stakes as GameStop took advantage of its monstrous rally this year — more than 1,000% — to speed up its e-commerce transformation.
White Square Capital, a London-based hedge fund, is closing its main fund and returning capital after suffering losses from betting against GameStop, the Financial Times reported Tuesday.
Earlier this month, GameStop named former Amazon executive Matt Furlong as its new CEO.  The company also hired several other former Amazon executives, including Jenna Owens, its new chief operating officer; Matt Francis, its first chief technology officer; and Elliott Wilke, its chief growth officer.
For its fiscal first quarter, GameStop reported narrower-than-expected losses per share and revenue that topped Wall Street estimates. As of May 1, GameStop said, it had paid off its long-term debt and no longer had any borrowings under its asset-based revolving credit facility.

Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev's phone was seized by federal attorneys in one of the stock-trading app company's many legal battles, it revealed in its IPO filing on Thursday.
In a section outlining legal risks from investigations and subpoenas, the company noted that ""a related search warrant was executed by the USAO to obtain Mr. Tenev's cell phone."" Here, ""USAO"" refers to the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California, which was investigating Robinhood's restrictions on trading during the meme stock flurry around GameStop and other stocks early this year.
The company faces or has faced dozens of proposed class-action lawsuits, as well as examinations or investigations by regulators, state attorneys general, the SEC, FINRA, and the U.S. Department of Justice. The SEC filing notes that the company has ""become aware of approximately 50 putative class actions ... relating to the Early 2021 Trading Restrictions.""
Robinhood restricted the purchase of ""meme stocks"" such as GameStop and AMC in January because the company did not have the capital required by regulators to cover the requested trading volume. The company ultimately tapped $500 million through its credit lines and raised $1 billion overnight in order to lift the trading restrictions.
Investors have called the entire episode unfair and unlawful in court records previously reviewed by CNBC.
Tenev has received requests for information and requests for testimony, and Robinhood said that the incident has resulted in negative media attention and widespread customer dissatisfaction.
The company admitted these numerous litigation battles are ""expensive and time consuming"" and could damage its reputation and financials. But due to the preliminary nature of all of these proceedings, the company wrote, it is ""unable at this time to estimate the likelihood or magnitude of any possible losses related to these matters.""
The company also acknowledged in its filing with the SEC that it had received inquiries related to employee trading.
The IPO filing comes one day after news that Robinhood would have to pay a fine of $70 million to FINRA for its systemwide outages and misleading communication and trading practices.
Robinhood is a five-time CNBC Disruptor 50 company that topped this year's list.

AMC Entertainment's stock continued its wild ride Wednesday, with the price per share rising more than 100% and prompting a halt in its trading several times.
AMC is one of several so-called meme stocks that have seen a surge in interest from individual investors this year, along with names like GameStop and BlackBerry.
Financial advisors often caution against getting caught up in such frenzies. Yet in a recent survey, 34% of advisors admitted their clients had bought GameStop, while 20% of them had purchased the stock themselves, according to the Journal of Financial Planning and the Financial Planning Association.

For individual investors, the challenge can be taking on bets alongside professional investors such as short sellers, whose activity can also trigger big moves.
""Often you hear the narrative that it's just retail traders, but that's not the case,"" wrote JJ Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief market strategist, in a recent market update.
""The heavy volume suggests there's a lot of big firms in there, also,"" he said.
For example, distressed investment firm Mudrick Capital reportedly bought and sold 8.5 million AMC shares on Tuesday.
Understandably, investors may be so caught up in the gains that they forget to remember the potential for losses.
If you're looking to dabble in meme stock names, it's important to remember you're really playing a game like musical chairs, and behave accordingly, according to Dan Egan, vice president of behavioral finance and investing at Betterment.
""Half the game is figuring out how to sell before it crashes,"" Egan said.
When you pay for a ticket to a sporting event, you part with a sum of money but still get to see the game.
Investors in meme stocks should start with the same approach, Egan said.
If you invest in a stock like AMC, you should have a ""level of chill"" that you're doing it because it's entertaining, and if you lose money, that's fine, Egan said.
Before or while you're invested in a stock, it also benefits you to identify the point at which you would sell it ahead of time.
And be sure you hold yourself to that promise, Egan said.
""What often happens to people emotionally is they get to that price point, but then are like, 'Wait, what if it goes higher?'"" Egan said.
To avoid that, it's beneficial to set up a way for the transaction to happen automatically so that your emotions in the moment do not interfere.
""Anyone considering trading these should be aware of how volatile they can be, and go in prepared to be disciplined about levels where they want to get in and get out,"" Kinahan said of stocks like AMC or GameStop.
It can be exhilarating to participate in an investment where your activity contributes to price moves and you can commiserate with other investors on message boards.
""The communal aspect of it, the social aspect of it, is a really hard core drug to try and wean yourself off of,"" Egan said.
What's more, that can discourage you from selling the stock, which would mean you're no longer a part of a team or movement.
It's important to remember that you still need to put yourself first.
""The leaders of the movement aren't going to tell you before they sell,"" Egan said.
Because of the wild fluctuations trendy stocks are seeing, your initial 5% allocation could climb to 20% of your portfolio while you're not paying attention.
Try to rebalance when your position reaches sizes you wouldn't have invested in in the first place, Egan said.
It's also important to remember that when stocks have done well, they also have further to fall and more potential for loss, he said.
One way to still own the headline names without as much risk is to put your money in investments such as diversified exchange-traded funds instead, Egan said.

Robinhood to pay $70 million fine after causing 'widespread and significant harm' to customers,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/30/robinhood-to-pay-70-million-dollars-after-causing-users-significant-harm.html,"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNBC,"
Popular investing platform Robinhood has agreed to pay nearly $70 million to the financial industry regulatory authority (FINRA) to settle allegations that the brokerage caused customers ""widespread and significant"" harm on multiple different fronts over the past few years.
That is the largest financial penalty ever ordered by the organization, a non-government entity authorized by Congress to oversee hundreds of thousands of brokers across the U.S.
Specifically, FINRA's investigation found that millions of customers received false or misleading information from Robinhood on a variety of issues, including how much money customers had in their accounts, whether they could place trades on margin and more.
The inaccurate information cost customers more than $7 million, FINRA found, and Robinhood is required to pay restitution to affected users.
Other allegations addressed in the settlement include that Robinhood approved risky options trades for thousands of users when it should not have and did not do enough to prevent system outages in March 2020 that adversely affected millions of users.
Robinhood has invested in improving the platform and is building out its customer service team, Robinhood spokesperson Jacqueline Ortiz Ramsay writes to CNBC Make It in an emailed statement about the settlement.
""We are glad to put this matter behind us and look forward to continuing to focus on our customers and democratizing finance for all,"" she says.
Robinhood was launched in 2014 and attracted millions of customers, many of them first-time investors, with its easy-to-use app and industry-changing commission-free trades. But it has come under fire multiple times in the past few years, most recently during the GameStop rally earlier this year when it restricted trading.
FINRA's investigation found that Robinhood's customer service issues go back much further. Between 2018 and 2020, for example, Robinhood failed to report tens of thousands of customer complaints to FINRA that it was required to report, the organization says.
FINRA also alleges that Robinhood has ""negligently communicated false and misleading information"" at different times since September 2016.
Those misleading and false statements had hurt customers financially, FINRA found. The report also referenced the tragic story of a customer with details matching that of 20-year-old Alex Kearns, an investor who died by suicide in June 2020 after Robinhood showed a negative cash balance of $720,000 in his account. FINRA found that his balance was inaccurate, and that the value of his position was half of what the account displayed.
While Robinhood has offered options trading since December 2017, FINRA says it has ""failed to exercise due diligence before approving customers to place options trades,"" relying on algorithms, rather than people, to approve customers for the risky investing move.
""As a result, Robinhood approved thousands of customers for options trading who either did not satisfy the firm's eligibility criteria or whose accounts contained red flags indicating that options trading may not have been appropriate for them,"" FINRA writes.
Finally, the company failed to supervise the technology it uses to provide its core services between January 2018 and February 2021, resulting in a series of outages and systems failures. One of these outages occurred on March 2 and March 3, 2020, during extreme market volatility. FINRA says these outages cost certain individual customers tens of thousands of dollars.
Robinhood did not admit nor deny the charges, and it still under investigation by the SEC. On Wednesday, the company published a blog post to highlight the changes it has implemented to address customer concerns.

Crypto is 'the future of finance’: Why Gen Z is ditching traditional investments—but with caution,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/22/gen-z-investing-in-cryptocurrency-btc-eth-and-meme-stocks-amc-gme.html,"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",CNBC,"
The next generation of investors are super online ⁠— instead of traditional investments, many Gen Z and young millennial investors, from teens to those in their early 20s, are bullish on cryptocurrency and the technology that surrounds it.
This includes digital coins and blockchains, like bitcoin and ethereum; meme coins, like dogecoin; NFTs, or nonfungible tokens; and DeFi, or decentralized finance.
Some have spent the bulk of their savings on these type of investments: Nearly half of millennial millionaires have at least 25% of their wealth in cryptocurrencies, according to a new CNBC Millionaire Survey. More than a third of millennial millionaires have at least half their wealth in crypto and about half own NFTs.
Young investors have also taken part in recent meme stock rallies, which occur when retail investors buy up shares of stocks shorted by Wall Street hedge funds, like GameStop and AMC Entertainment. In part, the investors hope to force hedge funds to pay, overcoming what they see to be an inefficient system.
One reason young people have turned to alternative investments like crypto is simple: Many just don't trust traditional investment institutions, as Allison Reichel, 23, tells CNBC Make It. They prefer to rely on their own research rather than use insights from traditional institutions, like financial advisors from legacy firms.
That includes Reichel herself. While working on her Ph.D. in economics, Reichel is also a senior editor at crypto news site Blockworks in Washington, D.C. She started to invest ""heavily"" in crypto this year, and her crypto holdings account for most of her portfolio, she says. Reichel plans to hold her bitcoin and ether long term.
But this distrust isn't the only thing driving young people to invest in cryptocurrencies and meme stocks. First, many have a genuinely positive outlook on blockchain technology. And second, at the same time that they feel disconnected from traditional investments, many are finding community, and sometimes fun, in the crypto space. They want to invest in what they connect with, whether it be stocks, coins or digital assets.
CNBC Make It talked to several Gen Z and young millennial investors, like Reichel, about how these factors impact where they choose to put their money, and why they're still investing with caution.
Although some young traders bet on altcoins and attempt to turn a quick profit through buying and selling, many plan to ""hodl"" their favorite cryptocurrencies for the long haul.
""In any crypto, you have those super strong network effects where people believe in it so much that they're like, 'I'm never selling because I believe it's the future of finance,'"" Reichel says. ""I see the long-term applicability and use of crypto,"" she says of her own plans to hold.
That's true of many young investors, who believe in the technology itself.
While doing research for her Ph.D., Reichel was inspired by how bitcoin was being used to help those in need in different countries. In Venezuela, for example, crypto was a way that families could still receive money from relatives in the U.S. during a time when the president wasn't allowing humanitarian aid.
And although its high price may make owning bitcoin seem unattainable, Reichel points out the option to buy fractional shares called satoshis.
Similar reasons led 23-year-old Kyla Scanlon to begin investing in bitcoin and ether during college in 2016. ""I really liked the application that [bitcoin] has for people who are unbanked. My whole life thesis is, 'How do we create financial accessibility and equality for everybody?' I think crypto is one step in allowing people who don't have access to traditional methods like banks to do so,"" she says.
Scanlon first started trading options in high school and began working in asset management after graduating from college, which has boosted her confidence in her personal investment decisions, she says. Her core cryptocurrency holdings still consist of bitcoin and ether, and she also owns stock in companies like Roblox, Facebook and Etsy.
Scanlon is also bullish on blockchain technology, which is a decentralized digital ledger that documents cryptocurrency transactions and other information. ""I don't know if bitcoin will ever be like a currency, but I'm big on the technology,"" she says.
Kayla Kilbride, a 24-year-old known on financial TikTok as @girlstalkstocks with more than 108,000 followers, has ""a growing confidence in bitcoin and ethereum specifically,"" due to the capabilities of each blockchain.
Kilbride began investing in bitcoin and ether earlier this year, starting with small amounts here and there. She has just a few hundred dollars invested in cryptocurrency, but plans to continue to grow her holdings. In lieu of a full-time job, she currently day trades and sells NFTs of her social media content to earn income.
""As I began to understand the blockchain and the technology behind it, that is when I felt comfortable saying 'OK, even if I invested when bitcoin was priced at $60,000 and it drops down to, let's say, $20,000 or even lower, I can still support it, even if I lose money in the endeavor,'"" Kilbride says. ""The risk was worth it because I liked the technology.""
Many financial experts view cryptocurrency as a speculative, volatile and risky investment that can be susceptible to fraud.
But this doesn't worry Reichel, Scanlon and Kilbride much, in part because they're intentional with their investments.
Reichel is extremely bullish on bitcoin's future value, but only invests what she can afford to lose. ""I'm comfortable losing it because I make sure that I have all my bills paid,"" she says. ""Obviously it's great when the gains come, but for me, [bitcoin is] truly something that I believe has the potential to revolutionize monetary regimes throughout the world.""
Of course, many Gen Z and young millennial investors initially turned to cryptocurrency as a way to avoid traditional financial institutions, but still build wealth.
Reichel, Scanlon and Kilbride, who all research on their own and invest without the help of financial advisors, say part of their distrust stems from witnessing inequitable and inefficient financial systems.
The younger generation worries about their wealth and retirement, Reichel says. They don't want to rely on the same traditional systems that their parents did. ""I think a lot of people see inefficiencies and really want to change it,"" she says.
Scanlon agrees. She also believes concerns over inflation are driving some interest in cryptocurrency among young people.
And with crypto, the barrier to entry is often low.
""It's about accessibility,"" says Cooper Turley, a crypto strategist at ethereum-based streaming app Audius. ""With most tokens, there is no IPO. Retail investors have the same opportunities to contribute to and earn value from early stage [crypto] projects the same way venture capitalists do.""
Turley, 25, invested in bitcoin and ether in 2017 while in college, and now, he says those investments have made him a millionaire. Turley is an angel investor in the space, he says, and also acts as an advisor for Variant Fund, a crypto venture firm.
""This paradigm shift of democratized ownership paired with 24/7 trading and always-on exchanges is far more native to an internet-savvy generation than using a brokerage,"" he says.
Still, it's important to note that there are significant downsides to crypto. Experts warn investors to be cautious when putting money into cryptocurrency; it can be extremely volatile and it's possible to lose your entire investment.
Many young investors also choose to have fun with their investments by buying meme coins, like dogecoin, and meme stocks, like GameStop and AMC Entertainment.
""Crypto and meme stocks are more memorable to young investors than traditional companies,"" Turley says. ""Young investors care far less about the bottom line of a corporation and far more about a meme or narrative they can collectively share with their friends.""
Dogecoin, for example, launched in 2013 based on the ""Doge"" meme, which portrays a shiba inu dog. Its creators didn't intend for dogecoin to be taken seriously, but it is now one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, with a market value of over $22 billion.
Kilbride sees dogecoin as a way to introduce people to crypto. ""Dogecoin, being very cheap, is affordable. It's easy to understand,"" Kilbride says, which is part of the reason she bought it, too. ""I've invested more in bitcoin and ethereum because of dogecoin [gains].""
""Meme stocks take away those super scary aspects of finance,"" Reichel says. ""When you think about the stock market, the typical picture is all of these older guys in suits who have been running it for years."" That's not true for something like dogecoin.
There's also the feeling that seemingly everyone is getting in on the action. Though many meme coins are entirely speculative, very risky and sometimes fraudulent, it can be difficult to not jump in on the trades. ""It can be hard with all the FOMO (fear of missing out), because you see all these coins taking off,"" Reichel explains.
For Turley, ""the best example of a meme coin I've invested in is unisocks, or $SOCKS, a digital token representing a claim on a physical pair of socks,"" he says.
But sometimes, it's about more than fun. For many, the rallies of meme stocks like GameStop and AMC symbolized standing up to big-name Wall Street hedge funds, a desire that stems from a feeling of ""a lack of access for the 'little man,'"" Kilbride says.
To Scanlon, ""there's this underlying resentment because our parents were able to have a 60/40 stock/bond portfolio and be fine and retire with no worries at all. But that's not the case for this generation.""
Yet despite putting money into ""fun"" investments, these young investors still aim to be somewhat careful.
For Kilbride, that means avoiding any coins that seem sketchy. ""When there's so much hype ... a lot of people are getting tricked, a lot of other people think it's funny, but when you don't have so much [money] where you can just lose, it's too dangerous,"" she says.
While traditional investments feel inaccessible to the next generation of investors, many are finding a sense of community in alternatives like cryptocurrency and meme stocks.
""I say the C in AMC stands for community, because I think that's what [the frenzy] is about,"" Scanlon says. ""Post-pandemic, I think there's a sense of loneliness. People are finding community within the stock market, in the Discord servers, in Reddit. People are just craving community because we don't have that in the same way that we used to.""
Buying into things like GameStop and AMC is partially about being a small part of the movement, Kilbride says.
""When GameStop first rallied back in January, I invested as part of the community. I did not invest very much and I invested near the top, just to hold the line. I was like, 'I want to purchase to be able to print it out and frame it on my wall,'"" she explains.
The same was true for Reichel. ""I invested a little bit just because I was like, 'Oh this is fun,'"" she says. ""Companies that maybe never perform that well were having this crazy moment. I was like, 'I want to be part of this.'""
For some, the community aspect is at the core of their motivation to invest.
That includes Turley, who always considers the community that surrounds a coin before investing. In fact, ""I base my investments around the strength of the community,"" he says.

In this article
""The Big Short"" investor Michael Burry believes Reddit-favored meme stocks are set to crash like the dot-com and housing market bubbles of previous decades, Barron's reported Friday.
""I don't know when meme stocks such as this will crash, but we probably do not have to wait too long, as I believe the retail crowd is fully invested in this theme, and Wall Street has jumped on the coattails,"" Burry told Barron's.
""We're running out of new money available to jump on the bandwagon,"" he added.
Burry was one of the first investors to spot and profit from the subprime mortgage crisis, as profiled in the popular book and movie. He made headlines in 2019 after he said he was long GameStop, but sold his stake during the fourth quarter of last year, before the meme mania in January.
According to Barron's, he believes the speculative trading propping up these meme stocks could soon hurt regular investors.
GameStop made Wall Street history in January with its monstrous short squeeze that pushed the stock up 400% in one week. The video game retailer became a star on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, where retail traders aimed to push stock prices higher and squeeze out short selling hedge funds.
The trading mania revived last month as Reddit traders continued to pile into their favorite meme stocks including GameStop, AMC Entertainment and others.
While the frenzy has cooled as of late, these stocks are still up an unimaginable amount. GameStop has surged more than 1,000% in 2021, while AMC is up over 2,500% this year.
Retail investors represent about 10% of all trades in the market currently, according to a recent Morgan Stanley report. This level has come down since the third quarter of 2020 when retail investing was 15% of all trades during pandemic-induced retail frenzy; however, the current figure is still in the 82nd percentile.
GameStop has taken advantage of its massive rally to raise new capital to accelerate its e-commerce transformation. Last week, the video game retailer said it sold 5 million additional shares, raising $1.13 billion in capital. That's on top of an offering of 3.5 million additional shares in April, which raised $551 million for the company.
""This is a Godsend for these companies,"" Burry told Barron's.

Robinhood Markets filed for one of the most anticipated initial public offerings of the year on Thursday, revealing rapid growth resulting in 18 million retail clients and more than $80 billion in customer assets.
Unlike many recent IPOs, Robinhood was profitable last year, generating a net income of $7.45 million on net revenue of $959 million in 2020, versus a loss of $107 million on $278 million in 2019, according to Robinhood's S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
However, the brokerage lost $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2021 tied to emergency fundraising-related losses during January's GameStop trading mania. The company generated $522 million in revenue in the first quarter if 2021, up 309% from the $128 million earned in the first quarter of 2020. Options trading accounts for about 38% of revenue while equities and crypto are 25% and 17% of revenues, respectively.
The brokerage aims to raise $100 million in the public debut.
Robinhood plans to trade under the symbol ""HOOD"" on the Nasdaq.
In its prospectus, the company said it has grown its funded accounts, those which have bank accounts linked to them, to 18 million in March of this year from 7.2 million in 2020, an increase of 151%. Assets under custody have ballooned to roughly $80 billion from $19.2 billion last March. Monthly active users total about 17.7 million.
Robinhood plans to allocate between 20% and 35% of its IPO shares to its retail customers.
Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and JPMorgan are the lead underwriters on the deal, among other banks.
New York-based D1 Partners, Sequoia, Kleiner Perkins, Index Ventures and Google's venture capital arm, GV, are some of Robinhood's biggest venture capital investors.
Robinhood was founded in 2013 by now CEO Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. Now, the company has 2,100 full-time employees.
The Menlo Park, California-based start-up pioneered free stock trading, forcing the entire industry to drop commissions in 2019.
Robinhood offers equity, cryptocurrency and options trading, as well as cash management accounts. Users can make most trades for free. The app makes the majority of its money from customer order flow and a premium paid service.
The stock trading company collected a record $331 million in payment for order flow – the money brokerage firms receive for directing clients' trades to market makers – in the first quarter of 2021, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC.
""Because a majority of our revenue is transaction-based (including payment for order flow, or ""PFOF""), reduced spreads in securities pricing, reduced levels of trading activity generally, changes in our business relationships with market makers and any new regulation of, or any bans on, PFOF and similar practices may result in reduced profitability, increased compliance costs and expanded potential for negative publicity,"" the S1 filing said.
Robinhood — whose longstanding mission is to ""democratize"" investing — is seen as the main gateway for young investors to access the markets.
The app experienced record levels of new, younger traders entering the stock market during the pandemic.
That surge has continued into 2021, marked by frenzied trading around so-called meme stocks. The millennial-favored stock trading app found itself in the middle of a firestorm in January amid the short squeeze in GameStop, which was partially fueled by Reddit-driven retail investors.
At the height of GameStop's surge, Robinhood restricted trading of certain securities due to increased capital requirements from clearing houses.
Robinhood announced on May 20 that it is giving retail investors access to IPO shares, an area long exclusive to Wall Street banks and sophisticated investors.
Robinhood's impressive growth has come with its challenges.
On Wednesday, Robinhood was slapped with FINRA's largest ever penalty, totaling about $70 million. The settlement regards the technical failures Robinhood experienced in March of 2020, Robinhood's lack of due diligence before approving customers to place options trades and purveying misleading information to customers about aspects like trading on margin.
Robinhood has also faced lawsuits for its multiple days of outages during times when trading volume was heavy during the pandemic.
""We have grown rapidly in recent years and we have limited operating experience at our current scale of operations; if we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our financial performance may suffer and our brand and company culture may be harmed,"" Robinhood said in the ""risk factors"" section of the prospectus.
Robinhood paid the Securities and Exchange Commission $65 million after being charged with misleading customers about how the app makes money and failing to deliver the promised best execution of trades. The SEC's charges came a day after Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint accusing the trading app of predatory marketing on inexperienced investors.
Robinhood was also sued for wrongful death by the family of Alex Kearns, a 20-year-old customer who took his life last summer after believing he had racked up big losses on the millennial-favored stock trading app.
Additionally, Robinhood's chief Tenev was forced to testify to the U.S. House Financial Services Committee in February regarding the GameStop trading mania. Legislators criticized payment for order flow, the subsidy Robinhood receives from market makers like Citadel Securities for bringing them trades.
Payment for order flow is a common practice, but it's often criticized for its lack of transparency. 
Robinhood has since taken steps to address some of the scrutiny like providing more education services from its clients and removing the confetti feature when investors make trades.
Robinhood ranked No. 1 on this year's CNBC Disruptor 50 list.
