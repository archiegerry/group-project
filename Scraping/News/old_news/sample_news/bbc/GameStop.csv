GameStop: Meet the amateur traders fighting Wall Street,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55843829,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Until the start of the pandemic, it had never occurred to Alex Patton that he could become an amateur trader.
But now, in the wake of the GameStop shares frenzy, he is something of an unlikely veteran of the financial markets.
""Before Covid struck, I didn't know the first thing about investing,"" says the 28-year-old railway cyber-security engineer, of Kingston upon Thames, south-west London.
But after the stock market took a bad tumble in March last year and dealt his pension savings a blow, he decided that he should, as he puts it, ""take a more active role in managing my money"".
As a dual national with British and American citizenship, he had no difficulty in setting up an account with US trading platform Robinhood, which has found itself at the centre of the GameStop furore.
Anger as trading in GameStop shares is restricted
GameStop: What is it and why is it trending?
And, encouraged by friends, he started checking out Reddit's chat thread wallstreetbets.
""I thought, 'This is crazy,'"" he told the BBC. ""Lots of people losing lots of money.""
""I didn't give it much thought until my friend said, 'You should check out GameStop.' And I realised that some of the people on Reddit do some really impressive work in researching those stocks.""
Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. And some of the research on Reddit indicated that positions taken by short-sellers accounted for more than 100% of existing GameStop shares, Alex says.
""People had done research showing what a risky position those hedge funds were in. And we thought, 'We can exploit that. This is an opportunity.'""
In the ensuing mania, amateur investors drove up the share price by more than 700% in a week. 
Alex did well out of the deal, investing $1,000 in GameStop shares and making $2,000 profit on top of that. But he was one of the fortunate ones who got out in time.
""The theory was that as the price continued to go up, the people who shorted the stock would be forced to buy those shares at whatever price to close their short,"" he says.
But as the activity drew regulatory attention this week, retail investors found themselves suddenly shut out by their trading platforms, unable to keep buying shares in GameStop and certain other companies.
""They assume we retail investors can't manage our risk, whereas hedge funds have taken a huge risk, an unbelievable risk, and they're just allowed to carry on, business as usual,"" says Alex.
Although Alex emerged financially unscathed, he is still smarting at what he sees as injustice.
""There's a huge gap between ordinary middle-class, working-class people versus hedge funds that have billions,"" he says. ""Other people are hurting from this a lot more than me.""
Myron Sakkas says traders like him are angry
Eighteen-year-old Myron Sakkas,of Coventry, who is studying at Warwick University, lost £30 on GameStop shares, which he owned for ""a couple of hours"" and sold when he saw what was happening.
He has had an account on the Trading 212 platform since August last year and is hoping to go into investment banking after he gets his degree.
But for now, he is disillusioned by what he sees as ""market manipulation"" directed against people like him.
For him, there was a definite target in the GameStop share wars: as he puts it, ""the people that were responsible for [the financial crisis of] 2008 and were never held responsible"".
""We understand that there are risks, but this wasn't an actual crash. It was caused by people protecting corporate interests and normal people lost again.
""When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,"" he told the BBC.
""They support a capitalist free market only when it works for them. What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money.""
Myron says he has been locked out of his account and is unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the £1,000 he has in it and call a halt.
""Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,"" he says. ""I've got other stuff to do.""
On social media, investors rallied their fellow traders, urging them to hold onto shares to avoid further losses, while attacking the platforms for the restrictions.
Melissa Holdren, a 43-year-old nurse who lives in the US state of Massachusetts, was so angry about the clampdown by the trading platforms that it spurred her to buy into one of the companies affected.
She used her account at Fidelity, a major brokerage known for its mutual funds, to purchase about $500 worth of shares in AMC Entertainment, which like GameStop has had its share purchases restricted by some brokerages.
It was a first for the 43-year-old nurse, who has always relied on big companies to manage her retirement investments for her.
""I find it very questionable that a private corporation could one-way block the purchases of stock,"" she says. ""It doesn't seem right. If you're worried about market volatility why are you only blocking one side of the transactions?""
Melissa, whose grandfather made his living as an independent stock trader, says she knows she could lose money if AMC's stock falls. But she is hoping her small investment will help the AMC movie theatre chain survive - while taking a stand against Wall Street.
""In general we need to rethink a lot of our financial structures,"" she says.
""After the 2008 crash... it became made it clear that a lot of the financial market was divorced from reality in a way that I don't think is healthy"", she said.
""To be specifically concerned with what's going on on Reddit right now and not be concerned about that larger picture I think is specious.""

Anger as trading in GameStop shares is restricted,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55837519,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Amateur investors are responding with outrage after trading platforms curbed buying of shares in the US games firm GameStop and other companies.
The moves by Robinhood and Interactive Brokers follow days of frenzied trading that led to massive gains for some stocks. 
Shares in GameStop dived by as much as 55% after the restrictions.
It is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants.
Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. 
But they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites such as Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in a week.
Other firms, such as AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry, also saw sharp gains. They were embraced by day traders after hedge funds bet against them.
The activity has drawn questions from regulators, who are monitoring trading amid fears of illegal actions.

However, the amateur investors say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game.
In online forums they discussed legal action and accused Robinhood and other brokerages enacting their own form of market manipulation by restricting purchases of certain shares.
Robinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev tweeted that the firm had taken its decision based on regulatory requirements, and said limited buys of the restricted stocks would be allowed from Friday.

Myron Sakkas says traders like him are angry
""They support a capitalist free market only when it works for them. What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money,"" said 18-year-old Myron Sakkas of Coventry, a student at Warwick University.
Myron, who has had an account on the Trading 212 platform since August last year, said he had lost £30 on Gamestop shares, which he owned for ""a couple of hours"" and sold when he saw what was happening.
Myron said he had since been locked out of his account and unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the £1,000 he has in it and call a halt.
Though hoping to go into investment banking after he gets his degree, he said he was disillusioned by what he sees as ""market manipulation"" directed against people like him. 
""When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,"" he told the BBC.
""Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,"" he added. ""I've got other stuff to do.""
Key to what's going on is ""short selling"" or ""shorting"", where a big investment company such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall.
The hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit.
GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street.
But in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. 
If the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses  - a process known as covering.
However, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still.
And amateurs aren't the only ones getting in on the action.
This week, for example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
In the US, anger over the trading restrictions united politicians whose stances typically sharply diverge.
Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is taking over as chair of the banking committee, said he would hold a hearing about the ""state of the stock market"".
""People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they're the ones getting hurt,"" he said.

Dave Portnoy, founder of the Barstool Sports blog, who has emerged as one of the most high-profile amateur traders during the pandemic, also attacked the restrictions, singling out Robinhood, which has cast itself as a platform aimed at making Wall Street more accessible.

A one-word tweet by the billionaire entrepreneur on Tuesday - he tweeted ""Gamestonk!!"" - had been seen as giving Gamestop shares an extra boost.
The fracas follows a jump in casual investing during the pandemic, which saw people stuck at home with time on their hands and limited places to spend pour money into the market.

Despite the economy shrinking, US stocks have rallied
The surge has produced ripples of worry on Wall Street, including concerns that inexperienced investors could cause bubbles in certain stocks or were dabbling in investments with risks they did not fully understand.
Robinhood - which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new interest in investing - has faced particular scrutiny for the way its app has made investment seem like a game. 
Last year, Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint accusing the company of marketing to inexperienced users and failing to protect them.
Officials said this week they were following the market battle.
Press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday President Joe Biden’s economic team, including newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, was “monitoring the situation”.
Massachusetts state regulator William Galvin called on the New York Stock Exchange to suspend GameStop for 30 days to allow a cooling-off period. ""This isn't investing, this is gambling,"" he said in an interview. ""This is obviously contrived.""

Google halts Play Store 'review bombing' by GameStop traders,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55853568,"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Google has removed a wave of negative reviews of popular stock-market trading apps targeted by furious investors.
Platforms such as Robinhood have been hit after preventing independent traders buying GameStop and AMC shares.
Users of a Reddit message board had managed to upset the market by buying the shares and inflating their value, hitting established hedge funds.
Many online traders, feeling betrayed by Robinhood's restrictions, have hit back with critical reviews of the app.

WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop?
Google has removed tens of thousands of one-star reviews for the widely-used trading app - which had previously had a four-star average.
It says it takes action when it sees ""fake ratings"", designed to manipulate a product's average score.
But more one-star ratings - the minimum possible - have continued to appear.
While Robinhood stopped independent users from buying some shares after the surge in investment by independent traders, they still remained available to large, professional traders elsewhere- leading to accusations that Robinhood was effectively protecting big investors and manipulating the stock market.
Robinhood said that the restrictions were put in place for ""risk-management"" reasons - and not because it had been told to limit activity by anyone else.
But as first reported by 9to5Google, external, it prompted a co-ordinated campaign to hit the app with a barrage of one-star reviews.

Confused investors inundate Robin Hood society
The site reported that more than 100,000 negative reviews had brought the average rating from four stars down to just one.
Hours later, Google intervened to delete roughly 100,000 reviews, according to the review counter, restoring the app's high rating.
Google rules are designed to prevent so-called ""review bombing"" - when reviewers co-ordinate to drag down an app's rating, usually because of some external scandal or political disagreement.
It has not yet responded to requests to comment on its Play Store decision.
While there had been calls on social media to review Robinhood negatively, many investors feel they have a legitimate grievance.
Some users of the Reddit WallStreetBets community, which is at the centre of the movement, believe they are taking a principled stance against hedge funds short-selling the stocks, hoping the company will fail.
The concern is also reflected by some major US politicians from both parties.

GameStop,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55889331,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Take a company that's been around for years. Think of a high street VHS video store in the age of Netflix, for example. I, a cynical financial investor, think to myself - I don't like the prospects for that company - it looks out of date, I reckon it's doomed. The shares cost £1 each - a year from now I reckon it will surely be bust.
Thanks to the way the financial markets work there is a way I can make money out of this company's seemingly inevitable demise.
I find someone who owns the shares and I borrow 1,000 of them in return for a small daily fee. I then sell the shares I've borrowed, pocketing £1,000 but I still owe the owner (I am ""short"") 1,000 shares.
Sure enough, the shares start to fall. Everyone starts to agree with me and the shares fall to 50p.
I buy those shares back for £500, give back the thousand shares I borrowed and, hey presto, I'm up £500 on the deal. If it went bust - even better, the shares cost nothing to buy back so I could have made as much as £1,000.
However, what happens if after I've sold them, the company suddenly starts doing well? VHS tapes are suddenly cool again. The shares start rising to £2 - to get back the shares I borrowed and owe I would have to pay twice the money I got for selling. I am £1,000 down. Here's the scary thing for me - the amount I could lose is UNLIMITED - as the shares rise, more people pile in.
Then some of the other people who have done what I've done (the other ""shorts"") start panicking and decide to cut their losses by buying back the shares they have borrowed and sold. This only adds to the stampede of buyers.
Do I hold my nerve? If the share price goes up much further my debt will overwhelm me and I'll be ruined. That is what happened with GameStop. Some of the hedge funds who had bet against the company eventually raised the white flag and lost billions of dollars.
Global watchdogs on alert as GameStop frenzy grows
GameStop: The amateur traders fighting Wall Street
GameStop: Who is winning the market battle?
An army of small investors started pushing the shares up, from $20 to $450, turning the tables on the cynical professionals who were betting this company would fail. A classic and romantic tale of David and Goliath - or more like the Ewoks beating the Empire.
Emboldened by their success, this golden horde of small investors look around for other companies the pros had written off and betted heavily against. 
But hang on a minute. What are GameStop shares actually worth? $450 or $20? If I was late to this party I may have paid 20 times more than it's worth - whatever money I put is at very great risk of being lost. Small investors are being encouraged to do something manifestly bad for their own financial well-being.
This is where the brokers and their regulators get nervous The companies that operate the small investors' accounts start shutting down the activity before the regulators get angry. They say they are trying to protect the little guy who sees something going up and wants a piece of the action to make a few bucks.
The army of small investors cry foul: you are limiting my freedoms - it's my money to do what I want with - you are protecting the establishment - where were you when the establishment was taking ludicrous risks? - oh yes, you bailed THEM out.
Suddenly this is a political debate. My freedom to trade is the financial equivalent of my freedom of speech and the powers that be are silencing me.
When I pointed out on Twitter that I was worried that the glee at duffing up the hedge funds would be replaced by anger and disappointment when small investors lost money they couldn't afford to, many agreed. But I was also met with some pretty stern ideological resistance.
""It's their right to lose money if they want. Stopping them is scary big brother behaviour.""
""Wall Street turned to suppression of the regular Joe investor.""
""You just don't get it do you? This is not about money - it's about upsetting the control of the elites.""
The point here is that the army of small investors will have enlisted for different reasons.
Some will hope to profit from getting in early and starting a wave of others doing the same, ride it for a bit before getting off the wave and letting it crash after they've taken their profits. 
Others will see something going up and think the sky's the limit to this - still plenty of time for me to profit too.
And others will think - I don't really care if I lose a few bucks, sticking it to the man is the name of the game.
The first group will have made money and indeed may be being infiltrated right now by the very professionals they hoped to beat.
The second group will end up poorer and unhappy about it.
The third may end up poorer but don't care - they have made a telling political point.
The regulators have done the equivalent of what Twitter and Facebook did to Donald Trump. Even Angela Merkel - who holds no candle for Donald Trump - thought that was a mistake.
With GameStop - no shots were fired, no one died, not a single window was broken.
GameStop is as much a political as a financial story.
You can hear more on this story on Business Daily, on the BBC World Service.

Gamestop: 'Failing' firm soars in value as amateurs buy stock,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55817918,"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Shares in a US games company have soared more than 300% in the past week - the result of a fight between private and professional investors.
Video games bricks-and-mortar retailer Gamestop is arguably something of a relic in a world moving online.
But its share price soared another 120% in Wednesday trading in New York. 
Analysts blame tech-savvy young day traders, who they say are taking on hedge funds in a conflict with generational overtones.
And the phenomenon could be spreading to Europe, with several stocks subject to unusual fluctuations in Wednesday trading.
It's a battle between Wall Street pros and upstart investors using social media platforms such as Reddit, analysts say. And at the moment, the upstarts have the upper hand.
It is, says Neil Wilson from markets.com, getting weird: ""We are seeing some serious funny business in some corners of the market.""
""Will it end badly?"" asks Thomas Hayes, managing director at Great Hill Capital hedge fund. ""Sure. We just don't know when.""
What's driving up the Gamestop price? Certainly not any good news coming out of the company. Gamestop - described as a ""failing mall-based retailer"" by one professional investor - made a loss of $795m in 2019, and probably several hundred more in 2020.
But that's not deterred an army of social media day traders, with access to free and low-cost trading platforms such as Robinhood, and who probably have a lot of time on their hands during lockdown. They've been swapping tips and ramping up prices via Reddit's chat thread wallstreetbets.
Gamestop is not the only stock in their sights - Blackberry, AMC and Nokia Oyjis are others - but is currently the battleground between the Goliaths like hedge funds and big investors, and the Davids who make up Reddit's private punters.
Key to what's going on is ""shorting"", where, say, a hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors in the belief that the price of stock is going to fall. 
The hedge fund sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit.
That's the somewhat simplistic theory, anyway.
Gamestop is the most shorted stock on Wall Street, with some 30% of the shares thought to be in the hands of hedge fund borrowers. 
But Reddit's retail investors have embarked on a frenzy of share buying and options trades, pushing up the price and putting a ""short squeeze"" on the pros.
In this supercharged trading environment, the big Wall Street investors rush back into the market to limit their losses, with the demand pushing up the price still further. 
One hedge fund, Melvin Capital Management, reportedly had to be bailed out with more than $2bn to cover losses on some shares, including Gamestop, while another short-seller, Citron Research, has also withdrawn from the fray.
For many Reddit investors, it's not just about making money. They smell blood.
Analyst Neil Wilson says that from reading the Reddit chat threads, the day traders' battle with Wall Street is clearly personal. 
""Among the many aspects of this story that are strange, what is so unusual is the peculiar vigilante morality of the traders pumping the stock. They seem hell-bent on taking on Wall Street, they seem to hate hedge funds and threads are peppered with insults about 'boomer' money. 
""It's a generational fight, redistributive and all about robbing the rich to give to the millennial 'poor'.""
But many big investors are refusing to budge and continue to hold their Gamestop stock at rock-bottom prices. They believe the tide will turn on Reddit's herd instinct and Gamestop shares will come back to earth.
""These are not normal times and while the [Reddit] thing is fascinating to watch, I can't help but think that this is unlikely to end well for someone,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said.
In the meantime, some European stocks appear to have been targeted in similar fashion by day traders.
They include media company Pearson, which saw its share price surge nearly 14% in London trading on Wednesday, and German drugs firm Evotec, which rose 9.6% in Frankfurt.
In another surprise twist, the unprecedented rally was given a further boost by Elon Musk.
The billionaire Tesla boss tweeted the word ""Gamestonk"", along with a link to the Reddit message board that had been pumping the stock. 
For its part, Reddit said it had not been contacted by the authorities over the stock price movements.
""Reddit's site-wide policies prohibit posting illegal content or soliciting or facilitating illegal transactions. We will review and co-operate with valid law enforcement investigations or actions as needed,"" a spokeswoman said.
The market turmoil has even come to the attention of new US President Joe Biden, with the White House saying it is ""monitoring the situation"".
For stock market veterans, it's an example of the madness of speculative trading that can only end in tears. And for regulators, it's a headache, as they are the ones who should be cracking down on market manipulation.
Jacob Frenkel, a former lawyer at the Securities and Exchange Commission, the main US financial regulator, said: ""Such volatile trading fuelled by opinions where there appears to be little corporate activity to justify the price movement is exactly what SEC investigations are made of.""
However, other experts believe Reddit's legion of investors represent a generational shift in attitudes to money and use of new technology. 
""I don't think this is a fad,"" said John Patrick Lee, a video game investment expert at VanEck. ""A retail trader will not lean on Wall Street to manage their money and I definitely now see an antagonistic relationship between the old guard [Wall Street] and individual traders who are on the rise,"" he said.

Elon Musk grills Robinhood boss over GameStop row on Clubhouse,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55888782,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Elon Musk (R) spoke to the Robinhood co-founder on Clubhouse
Tesla boss Elon Musk has grilled trading app Robinhood's co-founder, Vladimir Tenev, about why it limited users to only being able to buy a small number of shares in some companies.
The move came after US games retailer GameStop's stock surged amid a campaign to cause hedge funds large losses. 
Mr Tenev denied “conspiracies” that he was trying to help the hedge funds.
Instead he blamed a demand that Robinhood provide a $3bn (£2.2bn) security deposit at short notice. 
The interview was conducted on the audio-only social network Clubhouse.
Mr Musk's 90-minute appearance was a major coup for Clubhouse, which is currently in a ""beta"" testing phase and requires users to be invited to access its platform.
It allows people to join private rooms for conversations, but participants are capped at 5,000. 
However, fans streamed the interview on YouTube, external and overflow rooms on the platform, as Mr Musk's appearance attracted unprecedented attention.
Mr Musk also spoke about travel to Mars, Bitcoin and brain implants during his session.
Robinhood curbed buying of GameStop and some other shares last week. 
Unlike most trading platforms, it does not charge a commission for letting users buy and sell shares. Instead it makes money by selling data on those deals to others before they go through.
Some hedge funds have lost out on the rise in GameStop's shares because they had shorted the stock. This is where an investor tries to make money by betting a company's share price will fall.
And Mr Musk questioned to what degree Robinhood was ""beholden to"" Citadel Securities, which is its biggest client. Citadel has suffered losses as a result of an investment in a hedge fund that had taken a large short position on GameStop.
Mr Musk has previously been critical of short selling, claiming it to be a ""legal"" scam.
Mr Tenev acknowledged that there had been ""a rumour that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into"" putting restriction on trades, but added the claim was ""just false"".
“Robinhood stands for, you know, democratising access to stocks,” he said on Clubhouse. 
“We want to give people the access… but we had no choice in this case, we had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements.”
Mr Musk asked in response: “Did you sell your clients down the river, or [did] you have no choice?”
Mr Tenev repeated that Robinhood had to comply with financial requirements.
He said this involved an order from the National Securities Clearing Corporation - a clearing house used by the company - to provide ""around $3bn"" to back up its trades. He added the demand was later reduced to $700m.
Mr Tenev conceded, however, that Robinhood needed to be more transparent.

“We were able to open and serve our customers,"" he said, adding that Robinhood had raised more than $1bn within 24 hours.
""When we do open [on Monday]... we'll be able to kind of relax the stringent position limits that we put on these securities on Friday.""
Mr Musk also came out in support of Bitcoin, saying he thought it was on “the verge of getting a broad acceptance” by conventional finance.
The cryptocurrency has surged in value in recent months, but some experts say it is volatile and will crash soon.
“I should have at least bought some Bitcoin eight years ago,” Mr Musk said on Clubhouse. 
“Talk about being late to the party.
“I was a little slow on the uptake there… but I do at this point think Bitcoin is a good thing - I am a supporter of Bitcoin.”
The price of one bitcoin rose to above $34,000 on Monday morning, up from $33,000, following Mr Musk's comments.
The SpaceX head also said human travel to Mars will be possible within five-and-a-half years - and outlined his vision to relocate some humans there from Earth.

“I think the important part is just that we get people there,” Mr Musk added. 
“And we get the equipment necessary to establish a self-sustaining civilisation.”
He also said he believed he could get the journey time to the Red Planet down from six months to one month.
Another of Mr Musk’s projects, Neuralink, received attention in the interview.
The start-up explores ways to connect the human brain to a computer interface.
“In simplistic terms, I'd say it's sort of like a Fitbit in your skull with tiny wires,” Mr Musk said.
It implanted a chip in a pig’s brain last August, and Mr Musk revealed the company now had a monkey that could control video games via a brain implant.

Musk's team implanted a chip in the brain of a pig to create a machine interface.
“He's totally happy,” he said of the monkey. “It does not look like an unhappy monkey. 
""And you can't even see where the neural implant was put in. Except that he's got like a slight like dark mohawk - it's not uncomfortable. It doesn't look weird.”
Mr Musk said he hoped the technology could be used, in early applications, for humans with serious brain injuries. 
However, some experts have previously challenged the work of the firm.

GameStop investor battle moves on to silver as prices surge,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55882758,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Silver prices have hit an a eight-year high after calls to buy the metal on social media sparked a trading frenzy.
It comes a week after amateur investors piled into shares in the games retailer GameStop, causing them to jump 700%. 
On Monday silver rose by as much as 11% to $30 an ounce, while shares in some mining firms were up as much as 60%.   
Small time traders swapping tips on Reddit are thought to be behind the trend, as they seek to drive prices up.
However, some users of the site dispute this, alleging the ""Silver Squeeze"" is secretly being coordinated by big Wall Street firms.
It is the latest example of apparently small-time traders taking on big Wall Street hedge funds that hope to profit when the price of an asset or stock falls, but could lose heavily if it rises.
Tips posted on social media sites like Reddit say these so called ""short sellers"" are manipulating the markets. 
And so the amateurs buy up the stocks or assets, driving up the price and inflicting losses on the big players.

GameStop: Who is winning the market battle?
Global watchdogs on alert as GameStop frenzy grows
It began in January when amateurs piled into loss-making retailer GameStop and other companies such as AMC and Blackberry. 
GameStop shares, which were trading at less than $20 (£14.61) each at the start of January, shot to nearly $350 last week. They fell 30% on Monday to $225.
Now the battle appears to have moved on to silver - a far bigger market. 
The price of silver slid from its early highs on Monday. But the metal is up by almost 20% since Wednesday, when messages began circulating on Reddit forums, encouraging users to buy the metal.
Coin-selling websites say they are now seeing unprecedented demand and delays in delivering silver. 
Reflecting the attitude of many of those swapping tips on the site, one user called RocketBoomGo urged fellow traders to ""think about the Gainz"" in a widely circulated post. 
""If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP Morgan you'd be destroying along the way,"" they added.
Amateur investors caused shares in GameStop to surge more than 700% last week
However, some on Reddit expressed scepticism, with one saying they had analysed comments and posts on the thread Wall Street Silver and found that 80% ""came from accounts mostly created in the last 2 days. Pretty suspect.. who do these people really work for?!""
GameStop - a political fable
Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said that amateur investors would find it much harder to influence the price of silver than they did with GameStop.
For one thing, the total value of silver being traded is about $1.4-$1.6 trillion, he said, which is 1,000 times the total value of GameStop's share capital before it became the target of speculation. 
A large proportion of the silver market also exists ""off-exchange"", meaning it can't be bought and sold as easily online.
The army of small investors will have enlisted for different reasons.
Some will hope to profit from getting in early and starting a wave of others doing the same, ride it for a bit before getting off the wave and letting it crash after they've taken their profits. 
Others will see something going up and think the sky's the limit to this - still plenty of time for me to profit too.
And others will think - I don't really care if I lose a few bucks, sticking it to the man is the name of the game.
The first group will have made money and indeed may be being infiltrated right now by the very professionals they hoped to beat.
The second group will end up poorer and unhappy about it.
The third may end up poorer but don't care - they have made a telling political point.

WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop?
""Retail traders who are just following the herd and join the party late may accumulate huge losses and need to be more rational in their decisions,"" Mr Sayed added.
GameStop investors have already got a taste of those risks.
Shares in the company have fallen since last week, when the frenzy caught regulatory attention and trading platforms imposed restrictions on shares in GameStop and some other companies. 
That decision sparked anger among amateur traders, who say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game. Several prominent US politicians and the billionaire Elon Musk have voiced their support. 
The moves also convinced some online traders to dig in their heels, like Paul Grainger of Liverpool, a project manager at a telecommunications firm.
He added shares in GameStop to his investments after seeing online hype that persuaded him the price would rise. Now he's holding on, partly to send a message to the hedge fund giants.
""At first, I was in it like probably most people were were at the beginning, just to try to make a little bit of money on it,"" he said. ""But now... I'm out of principle holding the stock.
""I think it's wrong what they're doing and the fact that they've changed the rules of the game now that the little man's getting an advantage.""
Mr Grainger said he's ready to risk his holdings, which are a small part of his portfolio, and hopeful that if many people act similarly, those betting against the company will be the ones hit with losses. 
But he said he's not expecting there to be too many similar opportunities - in silver or elsewhere - in the future.
""Now that we've taken advantage of it, I don't think that the market will allow this to happen again,"" he said. 
""I think this is kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity and I'm hoping it will make those big companies change the way they operate so this kind of thing can't happen again.""
Despite what some retail traders hoped, some of the biggest profiteers from last week's market action were said to be Wall Street giants such as asset manager BlackRock and the private equity firm Silver Lake.
However, other big investors have been hammered by the trading frenzy.  
Hedge fund Melvin Capital - which bet heavily that shares in GameStop would fall - lost 53% of its value towards the end of January, according to media reports.  
The firm has since received commitments for fresh cash from investors, leaving it with around $8bn (£5.8bn) in assets, but that is still down from $12.5bn at the beginning of 2021, according to Reuters.

GameStop: What is it and why is it trending?,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-55841719,"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"You've probably stared blankly at your WhatsApp chat as the words ""GameStop"", ""Reddit"" and ""stock market"" get thrown around the way ""pub"" and ""meet at 8"" used to.
Your friends have become Jordan Belfort from the Wolf of Wall Street overnight, and you have no idea what they're on about.
Well, we see you slyly Googling ""What is a GameStop?"" and we're here to help.
Everyone loves a story of plucky underdogs and sticking it to ""The Man"" - and this one is a belter.
First, let's get the basics sorted.
GameStop is an American high street shop that sells games, consoles and other electronics.
The sort of thing you'd find between a doughnut shop and a makeup retailer in an American mall.
It's not anything new and exciting, in fact it wasn't doing very well because of the pandemic.
If you're not on Reddit, it's a social media site - kind of like Twitter or Facebook.
You join forums about particular topics you're interested in.
There are Love Island forums, football forums, history forums - you name it.
The one that's important in this story is called wallstreetbets. More than four million people are in it, usually discussing stocks and shares and where they're going to invest money.
This really is the basics, you're not Jordan yet
Like we mentioned, GameStop wasn't exactly thriving. 
With fewer people out shopping due to the pandemic and most games being sold online, things weren't looking great for the company.
People who buy and sell stocks often bet on which companies won't do well in the future. 
They borrow shares in the company and sell them, with a promise to buy them back at a later date. 
If you're sure the company will lose value, you'd make a profit when you buy them back and the price has fallen.
If you're still confused, it's analogy time.
Imagine you borrow some Pokemon cards from a mate, because you think the price of them is about to drop, and agree to give them back in a month. 
Then you sell them to someone else for £5 per pack.
You work on the assumption that you'll be paying less than a fiver for them after a month when they're not so new and exciting anymore. Let's say you buy them back for £3.
Congratulations, you've made £2!
This is a massively simplified explanation of something called shorting, or short selling - words you might've seen cropping up in your feeds in the last few days.
Think of it as gambling. If your bet was wrong and the price actually rises instead of falling, you'd lose money.
GameStop amateurs outwit Wall Street 
GameStop was one of the companies that loads of hedge funds (companies who do these bets) had bet on to lose a lot of value.
But huge numbers of people in the wallstreetbets Reddit forum swapped tips and bought shares in GameStop.
The demand raised its share price massively, which nobody saw coming, and everyone who had banked on it dropping in value had to buy their shares back.
The Tesla boss loves a tweet - and when he does, financial worlds tend to take notice. This one-word entry was enough to further send GameStop's price soaring.

He also linked to the Wall Street bets forum, where he's lovingly referred to as Papa Musk.
It's a good question.
For lots of people involved, it was just a laugh. 
Some excitement, something to pass the time with - an experiment to see the power of internet communities. 
Wall Street commentators have called it a ""phenomenon"", ""insane"", and like ""nothing [they've] ever seen"".
For many, the aim was to make stockbrokers and hedge funds lose money. Popular threads on Reddit include people saying it was payback - taking revenge against the big money companies seen as causing the financial crash in 2008.
Analyst Neil Wilson says some of the traders had a ""peculiar vigilante morality"".
""They seem hell-bent on taking on Wall Street, they seem to hate hedge funds and threads are peppered with insults about 'boomer' money.
""It's a generational fight, redistributive and all about robbing the rich to give to the millennial 'poor'.""
Some people on the forum said they donated their earnings to charity afterwards.
If nothing else, it was a good chance to make some memes.

GameStop: Who is winning the market battle?,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55864608,"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"This video can not be played
WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop?
Financial markets have been riveted by the tale of novice investors taking on Wall Street pros by buying up shares of US video games retailer GameStop, which many hedge funds had seen as a losing bet.
It's an apparently crowd-sourced attempt to beat billionaire traders at their own game.
But who's really winning and losing this battle?
GameStop, a loss-making chain of bricks-and-mortar shops, saw shares jump from being worth less than $20 each at the end of December to nearly $350 on Wednesday.
The surge has been attributed to a swarm of independent traders, swapping tips on social media, who saw an opportunity to pressure Wall Street hedge funds that had made deals assuming GameStop's share price would fall - and would have to purchase shares to cover losses if the stock rose more than expected. 
That, in turn, could generate a kind of buying frenzy - and chance for gains for the little guys.
In recent weeks, they've deployed the strategy on behalf of other firms, such as struggling theatre chain AMC Entertainment, owner of Odeon Cinemas. 
And the idea has caught on globally, fuelling activity in stocks traded in other parts of the world, including the UK, Brazil and Malaysia.

Asian investors inspired by GameStop surge
The social media forums where the amateur day-traders stoked enthusiasm for GameStop are full of snapshots showing how their bets have performed -  in some cases growing from tiny sums to positions worth millions of dollars.
But for many, these are just gains on paper - and could still end in big losses if the prices fall back.

AOC calls the GameStop saga ""a weird collision of social forces and economic factors""
On Thursday, after the wacky market conditions prompted some trading platforms, such as Robinhood, to restrict purchases, shares dipped.  Some traders posted comments confessing to nerves at the prospect of losses, while rallying their fellows to hold the line and avoid selling, staving off a sudden price collapse.
And on Friday, GameStop shares rose again, climbing 68% to $325 apiece, even as the market overall dropped.
If prices drop back, however, some who bought in too late will be hurt.
Billionaire investor Steve Cohen is among those reportedly facing losses
The buying frenzy has reportedly led to losses for some big name hedge funds, including Point72, a firm run by infamous investor Steve Cohen, a billionaire art collector and owner of the New York Mets baseball team whose first hedge fund, SAC Capital, pleaded guilty to insider trading charges and shut down. 
Some of the losses this week stemmed from Point72 money being managed by Melvin Capital, a company founded by a former SAC star trader, which had made big bets against Gamestop and was forced to pull out of the trade.
Other firms reportedly hit include Maplelane Capital and DI Capital, while other prominent short sellers have said  they - and their families - have been subject to harassment.
Analysts also say the pressure on hedge funds is one force behind broader declines in US markets in recent days, as firms sell other investments to cover their losses.
Mr Cohen, whose firm helped provide rescue funding to Melvin Capital amid the upheaval, has appeared to allude to the strains caused by the Reddit army, writing on Twitter: ""Hey stock jockeys keep bringing it"".

That's not to say there aren't investing pros benefiting from the battle against the short-sellers - many of which are still betting stocks will fall.
Firms like investment giant Fidelity and BlackRock, which own more than 10% of GameStop shares, have seen the value of their holdings rise. 
The surge also benefited Ryan Cohen, an entrepreneur who sold his online pet retail company Chewy to Petsmart in 2017 and revealed a major investment in GameStop last year.
Elizabeth Warren has called the GameStop trading frenzy a sign of market distortion and called on regulators to act
Executives at some companies favoured by the day traders, such as BlackBerry, have gotten windfalls from selling their shares.
It's creating opportunities for other kinds of companies too. For example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
In other ways, however, the episode could bode ill for Wall Street in Washington, where Democrats now claim slim majorities and Congress was already eying tax hikes for hedge funds. 
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a prominent voice in favour of tougher rules, has said the episode warrants wider investigation, pointing to fault on both sides of the battle, which she said was a sign of market distortions that could put the rest of the economy at risk. 
The founder of trading app Robinhood, which is facing even more scrutiny
Regulators already had their eyes on Robinhood, an app used to buy and sell shares that has seen its popularity explode amid the pandemic. 
The Silicon Valley company, which makes money in part from fees charged to Wall Street funds that execute customer orders, is accused of courting inexperienced investors and encouraging them to trade frequently and deploy risky strategies - even if it goes against customer interests.
This episode has only intensified regulator scrutiny.
Global watchdogs on alert as GameStop frenzy grows
Anger as trading in GameStop shares is restricted
Meanwhile, the firm said late Thursday it had raised more than $1bn amid questions about financial strains on the firm created by the buying frenzy. 
It's also facing outrage from customers - and lawmakers - angry after Robinhood was among the trading platforms to limit purchases of Gamestop and others' stocks, citing market volatility and risk.
GameStop, with more than 5,000 stores in the US and elsewhere, was losing money even before the pandemic
Many of the companies whose shares have been championed by day traders in the battle against the short-sellers are what have been dubbed ""90s nostalgia stocks"" - firms buffeted by changes wrought technology, like the decline of traffic to bricks and mortar shops and cinemas. 
The pandemic has only hammered them harder.
GameStop, which was founded in 1996 and now has more than 5,000 stores in the US, Canada, Australia and elsewhere, saw sales fall 30% in the first nine months of 2020. 
AMC Entertainment, the owner of Odeon Cinemas, meanwhile, warned last month it risked running out of cash, after traffic to its theatres plunged last year.
Some of those firms have seized opportunities created by the recent trading to ease financial strains.
AMC, for example, raised more than $300m by selling shares this week and has said it is exploring additional offerings.
American Airlines has said it is also planning to sell shares.
But regardless of what happens next in the financial markets, the challenges facing them in the real world aren't going away.

'Roaring Kitty' GameStop investor hit with lawsuit,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56106824,"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"A man who became a key player in frenzied trading of GameStop shares last month has been hit with a class action lawsuit.
Keith Gill, known as 'Roaring Kitty' on YouTube, allegedly duped retail investors into buying inflated stocks while hiding his sophisticated financial background.
Mr Gill has downplayed his impact and rebutted claims he violated any laws.
Separately, he will testify on Thursday to Congress about the ""Reddit rally"".
""The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,"" Mr Gill said in the prepared testimony.
""I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out the channel.""

Share buying mistakes 'on the rise'
Mr Gill allegedly bought GameStop shares for $5 (£3.60) and then used social media to drive shares from around $20 in early January to more than $400 in just two weeks.
This violated securities laws against manipulating the market, according to the lawsuit filed by Christian Iovin, a Washington state resident who purchased GameStop stock options.
Mr Gill said he used publicly available information to determine GameStop was undervalued, and shared this view with a ""tiny"" following on social media ahead of January's huge price surge.
The lawsuit also names as defendants Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co and its subsidiary MML Investors Services, which employed Mr Gill until 28 January.
The company told Massachusetts regulators it was unaware of Mr Gill's outside activities.
A number of people involved in the so-called ""Reddit rally"" are due to appear before Congress on Thursday, including Mr Gill. 
Others called to testify include Wall Street hedge fund Melvin Capital, along with the chief executive of Reddit.

GameStop investors on a wild ride
The chief executive of Robinhood, the trading platform that restricted the purchases of GameStop shares to investors during the trading frenzy, is also expected to testify.
The GameStop saga was hailed as a victory of the little guys against big Wall Street hedge funds that were betting against video games retailer GameStop and other struggling businesses. 
But it is unclear what role hedge funds had in the rally as some are reported to have made millions from the GameStop share rally, that was inspired by Reddit users.
The stock closed down 7% at just under $46 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Thanks to the way the financial markets work there is a way I can make money out of this company's seemingly inevitable demise.
I find someone who owns the shares and I borrow 1,000 of them in return for a small daily fee. I then sell the shares I've borrowed, pocketing £1,000 but I still owe the owner (I am ""short"") 1,000 shares.
Sure enough, the shares start to fall. Everyone starts to agree with me and the shares fall to 50p.
I buy those shares back for £500, give back the thousand shares I borrowed and, hey presto, I'm up £500 on the deal. If it went bust - even better, the shares cost nothing to buy back so I could have made as much as £1,000.
However, what happens if after I've sold them, the company suddenly starts doing well? VHS tapes are suddenly cool again. The shares start rising to £2 - to get back the shares I borrowed and owe I would have to pay twice the money I got for selling. I am £1,000 down. Here's the scary thing for me - the amount I could lose is UNLIMITED - as the shares rise, more people pile in.
Then some of the other people who have done what I've done (the other ""shorts"") start panicking and decide to cut their losses by buying back the shares they have borrowed and sold. This only adds to the stampede of buyers.
Do I hold my nerve? If the share price goes up much further my debt will overwhelm me and I'll be ruined. That is what happened with GameStop. Some of the hedge funds who had bet against the company eventually raised the white flag and lost billions of dollars.
Global watchdogs on alert as GameStop frenzy grows
GameStop: The amateur traders fighting Wall Street
GameStop: Who is winning the market battle?
An army of small investors started pushing the shares up, from $20 to $450, turning the tables on the cynical professionals who were betting this company would fail. A classic and romantic tale of David and Goliath - or more like the Ewoks beating the Empire.
Emboldened by their success, this golden horde of small investors look around for other companies the pros had written off and betted heavily against. 
But hang on a minute. What are GameStop shares actually worth? $450 or $20? If I was late to this party I may have paid 20 times more than it's worth - whatever money I put is at very great risk of being lost. Small investors are being encouraged to do something manifestly bad for their own financial well-being.
This is where the brokers and their regulators get nervous The companies that operate the small investors' accounts start shutting down the activity before the regulators get angry. They say they are trying to protect the little guy who sees something going up and wants a piece of the action to make a few bucks.
The army of small investors cry foul: you are limiting my freedoms - it's my money to do what I want with - you are protecting the establishment - where were you when the establishment was taking ludicrous risks? - oh yes, you bailed THEM out.
Suddenly this is a political debate. My freedom to trade is the financial equivalent of my freedom of speech and the powers that be are silencing me.
When I pointed out on Twitter that I was worried that the glee at duffing up the hedge funds would be replaced by anger and disappointment when small investors lost money they couldn't afford to, many agreed. But I was also met with some pretty stern ideological resistance.
""It's their right to lose money if they want. Stopping them is scary big brother behaviour.""
""Wall Street turned to suppression of the regular Joe investor.""
""You just don't get it do you? This is not about money - it's about upsetting the control of the elites.""
The point here is that the army of small investors will have enlisted for different reasons.
Some will hope to profit from getting in early and starting a wave of others doing the same, ride it for a bit before getting off the wave and letting it crash after they've taken their profits. 
Others will see something going up and think the sky's the limit to this - still plenty of time for me to profit too.
And others will think - I don't really care if I lose a few bucks, sticking it to the man is the name of the game.
The first group will have made money and indeed may be being infiltrated right now by the very professionals they hoped to beat.
The second group will end up poorer and unhappy about it.
The third may end up poorer but don't care - they have made a telling political point.
The regulators have done the equivalent of what Twitter and Facebook did to Donald Trump. Even Angela Merkel - who holds no candle for Donald Trump - thought that was a mistake.
With GameStop - no shots were fired, no one died, not a single window was broken.
GameStop is as much a political as a financial story.

FCA warning over 'risky' TikTok trading tips,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55948550,"Sat, 06 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"TikTok creators have been offering ""risky"" trading tips in the wake of the GameStop shares frenzy, a UK regulator has warned.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said people should be wary of users ""promising high-return investments"".
Many videos contain financial advice without disclaimers about the risks involved.
TikTok said it removed content that ""deceives people to gain an unlawful financial advantage"".

WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop?
The BBC found several popular video-makers on TikTok encouraging people to buy shares in GameStop, BlackBerry and AMC.
The share price of these companies saw a boost at the end of January, as people on a Reddit message board encouraged one another to invest.
Other videos encouraged people to invest in the crypto-currency Dogecoin.

GameStop: Who is winning the market battle?
Millions of videos have been posted using hashtags such as #bigstocktips, #fintok, #stonks, #stocktok and #stockstobuy.
Many of the videos fail to warn users that the content should not be taken as financial advice and that making investments carries a risk.
Several videos used examples of past market performance as an indication that users would receive a profit in the future. Past market performance can never guarantee future profits.
One popular astrologer with more than one million followers suggested that the position of the planets could affect the price of crypto-currency.
""This February is not the cutest for Bitcoin… Mercury is in retrograde,"" they said. The same account also made forecasts for Tesla, GameStop and the crypto-currency Ethereum.
""Consumers should be wary of adverts and advice online and on social media promising high-return investments, and should always do further research on the product they are considering,"" an FCA spokeswoman told the BBC.
""There are risks with taking unregulated investment advice and we engage with social media platforms to have pages which breach our regulations taken down."" 
The FCA said it hoped the government would include ""financial harms"" in its forthcoming online safety bill.
The crypto-currency trading platform Paxful, external analysed more than 1,200 TikTok videos and found that 14% of them encouraged users to make certain financial decisions without a warning about the risks involved.
In total, those videos had clocked up 16,765,837 views and 2,239,684 likes.
""Videos that encourage risky, over-simplified and impulsive financial decisions without appropriate disclaimers can mislead young or inexperienced viewers, damaging their finances as a result,"" it said in a blog post.
Since TikTok videos are short, there is little time in which to fully explain the financial risks, said Nick Agwuncha, co-founder of Money Medics, a start-up that provides financial education for millennials.
""TikTok is fast food content. It lacks depth,"" he said.
""You shouldn't be gullible to get-rich-quick schemes. If you're looking at personal finance and investing, you should always try to take a long-term mindset, do your due diligence and research.""
Some influencers may be self-motivated to recommend certain stocks they have already invested in, to increase demand and push up the share price, he added.
In a statement, TikTok said:"" We are committed to promoting a safe environment on TikTok, and actively work to educate our community about online safety and media literacy.""
TikTok said it removed content that depicted or promoted investment schemes with promises of high returns, fixed betting or any other types of scams.

Elon Musk grills Robinhood boss over GameStop row on Clubhouse,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55888782,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Elon Musk (R) spoke to the Robinhood co-founder on Clubhouse
Tesla boss Elon Musk has grilled trading app Robinhood's co-founder, Vladimir Tenev, about why it limited users to only being able to buy a small number of shares in some companies.
The move came after US games retailer GameStop's stock surged amid a campaign to cause hedge funds large losses. 
Mr Tenev denied “conspiracies” that he was trying to help the hedge funds.
Instead he blamed a demand that Robinhood provide a $3bn (£2.2bn) security deposit at short notice. 
The interview was conducted on the audio-only social network Clubhouse.
Mr Musk's 90-minute appearance was a major coup for Clubhouse, which is currently in a ""beta"" testing phase and requires users to be invited to access its platform.
It allows people to join private rooms for conversations, but participants are capped at 5,000. 
However, fans streamed the interview on YouTube, external and overflow rooms on the platform, as Mr Musk's appearance attracted unprecedented attention.
Mr Musk also spoke about travel to Mars, Bitcoin and brain implants during his session.
Robinhood curbed buying of GameStop and some other shares last week. 
Unlike most trading platforms, it does not charge a commission for letting users buy and sell shares. Instead it makes money by selling data on those deals to others before they go through.
Some hedge funds have lost out on the rise in GameStop's shares because they had shorted the stock. This is where an investor tries to make money by betting a company's share price will fall.
And Mr Musk questioned to what degree Robinhood was ""beholden to"" Citadel Securities, which is its biggest client. Citadel has suffered losses as a result of an investment in a hedge fund that had taken a large short position on GameStop.
Mr Musk has previously been critical of short selling, claiming it to be a ""legal"" scam.
Mr Tenev acknowledged that there had been ""a rumour that Citadel or other market makers kind of pressured us into"" putting restriction on trades, but added the claim was ""just false"".
“Robinhood stands for, you know, democratising access to stocks,” he said on Clubhouse. 
“We want to give people the access… but we had no choice in this case, we had to conform to our regulatory capital requirements.”
Mr Musk asked in response: “Did you sell your clients down the river, or [did] you have no choice?”
Mr Tenev repeated that Robinhood had to comply with financial requirements.
He said this involved an order from the National Securities Clearing Corporation - a clearing house used by the company - to provide ""around $3bn"" to back up its trades. He added the demand was later reduced to $700m.
Mr Tenev conceded, however, that Robinhood needed to be more transparent.

WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop?
“We were able to open and serve our customers,"" he said, adding that Robinhood had raised more than $1bn within 24 hours.
""When we do open [on Monday]... we'll be able to kind of relax the stringent position limits that we put on these securities on Friday.""
Mr Musk also came out in support of Bitcoin, saying he thought it was on “the verge of getting a broad acceptance” by conventional finance.
The cryptocurrency has surged in value in recent months, but some experts say it is volatile and will crash soon.
“I should have at least bought some Bitcoin eight years ago,” Mr Musk said on Clubhouse. 
“Talk about being late to the party.
“I was a little slow on the uptake there… but I do at this point think Bitcoin is a good thing - I am a supporter of Bitcoin.”
The price of one bitcoin rose to above $34,000 on Monday morning, up from $33,000, following Mr Musk's comments.
The SpaceX head also said human travel to Mars will be possible within five-and-a-half years - and outlined his vision to relocate some humans there from Earth.

“I think the important part is just that we get people there,” Mr Musk added. 
“And we get the equipment necessary to establish a self-sustaining civilisation.”
He also said he believed he could get the journey time to the Red Planet down from six months to one month.
Another of Mr Musk’s projects, Neuralink, received attention in the interview.
The start-up explores ways to connect the human brain to a computer interface.
“In simplistic terms, I'd say it's sort of like a Fitbit in your skull with tiny wires,” Mr Musk said.
It implanted a chip in a pig’s brain last August, and Mr Musk revealed the company now had a monkey that could control video games via a brain implant.

Musk's team implanted a chip in the brain of a pig to create a machine interface.
“He's totally happy,” he said of the monkey. “It does not look like an unhappy monkey. 
""And you can't even see where the neural implant was put in. Except that he's got like a slight like dark mohawk - it's not uncomfortable. It doesn't look weird.”
Mr Musk said he hoped the technology could be used, in early applications, for humans with serious brain injuries. 
However, some experts have previously challenged the work of the firm.

GameStop investor battle moves on to silver as prices surge,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55882758,"Mon, 01 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Silver prices have hit an a eight-year high after calls to buy the metal on social media sparked a trading frenzy.
It comes a week after amateur investors piled into shares in the games retailer GameStop, causing them to jump 700%. 
On Monday silver rose by as much as 11% to $30 an ounce, while shares in some mining firms were up as much as 60%.   
Small time traders swapping tips on Reddit are thought to be behind the trend, as they seek to drive prices up.
However, some users of the site dispute this, alleging the ""Silver Squeeze"" is secretly being coordinated by big Wall Street firms.
It is the latest example of apparently small-time traders taking on big Wall Street hedge funds that hope to profit when the price of an asset or stock falls, but could lose heavily if it rises.
Tips posted on social media sites like Reddit say these so called ""short sellers"" are manipulating the markets. 
And so the amateurs buy up the stocks or assets, driving up the price and inflicting losses on the big players.

GameStop: Who is winning the market battle?
Global watchdogs on alert as GameStop frenzy grows
It began in January when amateurs piled into loss-making retailer GameStop and other companies such as AMC and Blackberry. 
GameStop shares, which were trading at less than $20 (£14.61) each at the start of January, shot to nearly $350 last week. They fell 30% on Monday to $225.
Now the battle appears to have moved on to silver - a far bigger market. 
The price of silver slid from its early highs on Monday. But the metal is up by almost 20% since Wednesday, when messages began circulating on Reddit forums, encouraging users to buy the metal.
Coin-selling websites say they are now seeing unprecedented demand and delays in delivering silver. 
Reflecting the attitude of many of those swapping tips on the site, one user called RocketBoomGo urged fellow traders to ""think about the Gainz"" in a widely circulated post. 
""If you don't care about the gains, think about the banks like JP Morgan you'd be destroying along the way,"" they added.
Amateur investors caused shares in GameStop to surge more than 700% last week
However, some on Reddit expressed scepticism, with one saying they had analysed comments and posts on the thread Wall Street Silver and found that 80% ""came from accounts mostly created in the last 2 days. Pretty suspect.. who do these people really work for?!""
GameStop - a political fable
Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said that amateur investors would find it much harder to influence the price of silver than they did with GameStop.
For one thing, the total value of silver being traded is about $1.4-$1.6 trillion, he said, which is 1,000 times the total value of GameStop's share capital before it became the target of speculation. 
A large proportion of the silver market also exists ""off-exchange"", meaning it can't be bought and sold as easily online.
The army of small investors will have enlisted for different reasons.
Some will hope to profit from getting in early and starting a wave of others doing the same, ride it for a bit before getting off the wave and letting it crash after they've taken their profits. 
Others will see something going up and think the sky's the limit to this - still plenty of time for me to profit too.
And others will think - I don't really care if I lose a few bucks, sticking it to the man is the name of the game.
The first group will have made money and indeed may be being infiltrated right now by the very professionals they hoped to beat.

The third may end up poorer but don't care - they have made a telling political point.

""Retail traders who are just following the herd and join the party late may accumulate huge losses and need to be more rational in their decisions,"" Mr Sayed added.
GameStop investors have already got a taste of those risks.
Shares in the company have fallen since last week, when the frenzy caught regulatory attention and trading platforms imposed restrictions on shares in GameStop and some other companies. 
That decision sparked anger among amateur traders, who say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game. Several prominent US politicians and the billionaire Elon Musk have voiced their support. 
The moves also convinced some online traders to dig in their heels, like Paul Grainger of Liverpool, a project manager at a telecommunications firm.
He added shares in GameStop to his investments after seeing online hype that persuaded him the price would rise. Now he's holding on, partly to send a message to the hedge fund giants.
""At first, I was in it like probably most people were were at the beginning, just to try to make a little bit of money on it,"" he said. ""But now... I'm out of principle holding the stock.
""I think it's wrong what they're doing and the fact that they've changed the rules of the game now that the little man's getting an advantage.""
Mr Grainger said he's ready to risk his holdings, which are a small part of his portfolio, and hopeful that if many people act similarly, those betting against the company will be the ones hit with losses. 
But he said he's not expecting there to be too many similar opportunities - in silver or elsewhere - in the future.
""Now that we've taken advantage of it, I don't think that the market will allow this to happen again,"" he said. 
""I think this is kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity and I'm hoping it will make those big companies change the way they operate so this kind of thing can't happen again.""
Despite what some retail traders hoped, some of the biggest profiteers from last week's market action were said to be Wall Street giants such as asset manager BlackRock and the private equity firm Silver Lake.
However, other big investors have been hammered by the trading frenzy.  
Hedge fund Melvin Capital - which bet heavily that shares in GameStop would fall - lost 53% of its value towards the end of January, according to media reports.  
The firm has since received commitments for fresh cash from investors, leaving it with around $8bn (£5.8bn) in assets, but that is still down from $12.5bn at the beginning of 2021, according to Reuters.

GameStop surges again as Reddit crashes temporarily,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56190078,"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Shares in GameStop surged on Wednesday in what could mark a return to frenzied trading that rocked markets last month.
Trading in the US games firm was halted twice after shares more than doubled suddenly on Wednesday afternoon.
GameStop stock climbed by 104% until trading was halted for a second time - moments before markets closed.
The rapid rise came as Reddit, the online home of activist investors that led the GameStop movement in January, went down temporarily.
The stock gained nearly 90% in after-hours trading.
It came one day after the firm announced its chief financial officer Jim Bell would resign next month to help ""accelerate GameStop's transformation"".
Some investors have talked publicly and posted on social media site Reddit about not selling their shares in GameStop during last month's volatile trading because of what they see as its long-term potential.
On Wednesday, Reddit was down for many users. The company did not say what caused the outage but said it had identified the issue, fixed it and that ""systems are beginning to recover.""

It is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants.
Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall.
But they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites like Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in one week.
The retail trading frenzy drew concern from regulators and has even led to a Congressional hearing in the US.

Keith Gill, who became a key player in the trading and is known as 'Roaring Kitty' on YouTube, has also been hit with a class action lawsuit. He allegedly duped retail investors into buying inflated stocks while hiding his sophisticated financial background.
Mr Gill has downplayed his impact and rebutted claims he violated any laws.
'Roaring Kitty' GameStop investor hit with lawsuit
GameStop - David and Goliath or a political fable?
""The idea that I used social media to promote GameStop stock to unwitting investors is preposterous,"" Mr Gill said in the prepared testimony.
""I was abundantly clear that my channel was for educational purposes only, and that my aggressive style of investing was unlikely to be suitable for most folks checking out the channel.""
The GameStop saga was hailed as a victory of the little guys against big Wall Street hedge funds that were betting against video games retailer GameStop and other struggling businesses.
But it is unclear what role hedge funds had in the rally, as some are reported to have made millions from the GameStop share rally that was inspired by Reddit users.
The key part of the theory of why GameStop shares went up so high in January was a 'short squeeze'. 
This is when hedge funds, who'd bet GameStop shares would fall, tried to buy them back when the share price began to rise. 
That in turn pushed the price even higher. Some hedge funds lost hundreds of millions of pounds.
The prevailing view was that hedge funds wouldn't put themselves into that position again. That they would be all over Reddit and more careful about 'shorting'.  Therefore, you wouldn't see a giant spike in the share price again. 
But evidently, that view was wrong. That the share price, in just a few hours, could explode again tests some of the assumptions about what happened last month. 
It's often very difficult to understand exactly what drives a share price, and who is driving it. 
But it does once again appear that the hype on WallStreetBets, the influential subreddit, was part of the rise. 
Reddit even went down at one point, though it's not clear yet whether that was because of an increase in activity on the site. 
Policy makers will be looking on closely. At a hearing last week in Washington, many politicians were concerned that 'meme stocks' could spike again. 
That can be beneficial to some investors when the stock is rising. But on the way down amateur investors can get burnt too. 
If these kinds of spikes become more common, expect more pressure on legislators to step in.

Robinhood boss says GameStop episode 'unacceptable',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56116545,"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Vlad Tenev, co-founder of Robinhood, said his firm was forced to temporarily limit GameStop trades.
The head of the Robinhood trading platform has apologised to customers at a US congressional hearing prompted by last month's GameStop trading frenzy.
Vlad Tenev said the situation the firm faced in January - when financial strains led it to limit certain stock purchases - was ""unacceptable to us"".
""We are doing everything we can to make sure this won't happen again,"" he said.
Lawmakers said the move, which sparked outrage, had raised questions about fairness in financial markets.
""Many Americans feel that the system is stacked against them and no matter what, Wall Street always wins,"" said congresswoman Maxine Waters, who heads the House Financial Services Committee holding the hearing.
Mr Tenev said the firm, which is popular among everyday investors, was forced to temporarily limit trades in GameStop and some other firms due to new financial requirements it faced because of the surge in trading.

He said the firm moved quickly to raise new funds, which would help it avoid making similar moves in the future. 
He also denied that Robinhood had been acting at the behest of anyone else.  
""I'm sorry for what happened. I apologise,"" he said. ""I'm not going to say that Robinhood did everything perfectly, and that we haven't made mistakes in the past, but what I commit to is that we improve from this.""

GameStop: The amateur traders fighting Wall Street
Other key players called to testify at the hearing also denied wrongdoing in the affair, which saw the price of GameStop shares rise from less than $20 at the beginning of January to more than $350 in a matter of weeks.
The astonishing rise, apparently fuelled by a swarm of independent traders swapping tips on social media forums such as Reddit, has sparked probes examining the possibility of market manipulation and other potential conflicts of interest.
Robinhood's ties to Wall Street firm Citadel Securities have faced particular scrutiny. 
Robinhood receives fees from the market maker Citadel Securities, which pays to execute Robinhood customer orders. Citadel, the hedge fund business, and its partners last month invested in Melvin Capital, one of the hedge funds hit by losses after betting that GameStop's shares would fall.
Citadel and Robinhood attracted most of the attention at the hearing
Kenneth Griffin, the founder of Citadel Securities, said no-one in his company had any discussions with Robinhood about restricting trades in GameStop or other so-called ""meme stocks"".
""I first learned of Robinhood's trading restrictions after they were announced,"" he said.
Mr Griffin and Mr Tenev attracted most of the attention at the sometimes combative hearing, which saw lawmakers raise potential regulatory changes, such as requirements that firms disclose when they have made large bets against a stock.
Melvin Capital hedge fund manager Gabriel Plotkin told lawmakers that he was wary of holding short positions again after retail investors pushed GameStop shares higher, causing the firm shed 53% of its value.   
""They exploited an opportunity around short selling and we will have to adapt and the whole industry will have to adapt,"" he said.
Republicans sought to head off new rules, noting that it was government requirements that precipitated Robinhood to limit trades.
""Piling on more and more regulations only increases complexity and does not help investors,"" said Barry Loudermilk, a Republican representative from Georgia.
Ms Waters hit back at characterisations of the hearing as ""political theatre"" - but also suggested that she was not rushing to additional action.
""I didn't hear anyone here say they were ready to pile on regulations,"" she said.
Others testifying at the hearing included Melvin Capital chief executive Gabriel  Plotkin, Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman, and Keith Gill, a Reddit user and YouTube streamer known as Roaring Kitty who promoted his investment in GameStop.
Shares in the loss-making video games retailer have fallen back since January, closing at about $40 on Thursday.

Robinhood: US family sue trading app over son's suicide,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55990461,"Mon, 08 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Dan and Dorothy Kearns say their son thought he had caused ""impending financial disaster""
The parents of a man who killed himself last year have filed a lawsuit against trading app Robinhood over his death.
The lawsuit, first reported by CBS News, said 20-year-old Alex Kearns mistakenly believed he owed $730,000 (£530,000) when he took his own life.
Dan and Dorothy Kearns say their son was unable to get help or support from customer services before he died.
Robinhood said in a statement to the BBC they were ""devastated"" by Alex's death and had made improvements.
The app, which allows anyone to buy and trade stocks, says on its website that it is ""on a mission to democratise finance"" and is currently running an advertising campaign under the slogan of ""We are all investors"".
It recently made headlines for limiting sales of some shares to users after US retailer GameStop saw its stock surge.

'I didn't know I'd lose money so fast'
Speaking to CBS, the parents of Alex Kearns say he began using Robinhood just before he graduated high school, external. 
Mr and Mrs Kearns say they did not know the app had also approved him to buy and sell options - a risky financial instrument - despite a lack of financial experience. 
They say their son realised on 11 June 2020 that his account had been restricted by Robinhood amid what appeared to be a negative balance of more than $700,000 on his account.
CBS reports the student received an automated email at 03:26 early the next morning asking him to take ""immediate action"" to pay more than $170,000 within days.
The family accuse the company of having no ""meaningful customer support"" when he needed it
The family say the 20-year-old emailed customer service several times asking for support and help understanding the figures on his trading account, but only received stock response messages saying they would get back to him. 
""They provide no mechanism through a telephone call, through live email service, to get live answers to questions,"" a lawyer for the family told CBS.
His parents were told by police later that day, on 12 June, that Alex had died.
""He thought he blew up his life. He thought he screwed up beyond repair,"" Mr Kearns said in the interview, in which he said his son had ""just needed a little help"".
His parents say an email from Robinhood, received the day after his death, clarified that trading restrictions had been lifted and the trade resolved. 
The lawsuit, filed in California state court, said the loss had been covered by other options in his account and accuses Robinhood's ""misleading communications"" of leading to ""panic and confusion"".
Some officials have called for greater regulation of trading apps
The wrongful death lawsuit accuses Robinhood of unfair business practices and negligent infliction of emotional distress, US media report.
In a statement to the BBC, Robinhood said they have made improvements to their ""options offering"" since June including how they display buying power and providing more educational materials and revised experience requirements for users.
""In early December, we also added live voice support for customers with an open options position or recent expiration, and plan to expand to other use cases,"" a spokesperson said. ""We also changed our protocol to escalate customers who email us for help with exercise and early assignment. 
""We remain committed to making Robinhood a place to learn and invest responsibly,"" they added.

Reddit removed 6% of all posts made last year,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56099232,"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Reddit released its latest transparency report on Tuesday
Reddit removed 6% of all content posted in 2020, according to the site's annual transparency report.
Of the 3.4 billion posts made by its users in 2020, 233 million were removed - almost all  for spam.
More than 99% of removals were classed as spam, with the remainder made up of a mix of offensive content - including harassment, violent speech and sexualisation of minors.  
The number of removed posts rose almost 30% year on year.
Did these GameStop investors win or lose?
US regulators open privacy probes into tech giants
More than 131 million posts were removed, external by the platform's automated moderator, while the rest were taken down personally by administrators.
The automated moderator bot is used to approve posts made in Reddit's myriad small communities - called subreddits - and it has the power to remove any images or text submissions that contain banned words or phrases. 
More than 80,000 subreddits were removed in their entirety last year, nearly four times more than in 2019.
Most of those were due to lack of community moderation, harassment problems, or users who were trying to evade a ban by recreating an already-banned subreddit.
But one campaign group criticised the relaxed standards that allow many other communities to remain active.
""Reddit has made good progress by removing some of its worst offending forums, which were full of conspiracy theories and hatred, but it still has a long way to go,"" warned Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate.
""Reddit has only acted on a fraction of the hate on its site. Some forums active on the site today broadcast horrendous racism daily to thousands of members.""
And he added that his group had seen groups sprout up around ""dangerous misinformation"" about the Covid pandemic and ""these need dealing with urgently"".
Reddit also received 611 requests from law enforcement officials for information about its users. Reddit granted 424 of those requests, which usually involve a court order or search warrant.
Reddit has previously faced a backlash from its users over how it moderates content shared on the platform, with most of the work being done by its volunteer community moderators.
For example, the r/Ireland subreddit temporarily shut down in the early hours of the morning last year to limit the racist and extremist content posted from by US users in that time window - while Irish moderators were less active.

Reddit chief: I was late to spot GameStop stock mania,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56246852,"Thu, 04 Mar 2021 08:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Reddit boss Steve Huffman has told BBC News he supported the aims of controversial sub-Reddit WallStreetBets.
A long-time fan of the group, he said he had been slow in spotting its effect on GameStop's huge share-price spike in January. 
""I was actually a little late to the party, because I didn't realise that Reddit had leaked into the real world again"", he said.
GameStop's share price ended up reaching nearly $500 (£350) before falling. 
WallStreetBets had been hyping up the computer-game retailer's shares. 
The idea was if enough Reddit users bought GameStop shares, they could drive up the price, hurting hedge funds who had bet against the company. 
Some claimed the group had collectively manipulated the market. 
But Reddit decided to leave it up.
""We were... trying to keep WallStreetBets online,"" Mr Huffman said. 
When the media talks about the big social-media platforms - Facebook, Twitter, Instagram - Reddit is often ignored. 
But as hedge funds learned during the GameStop share-price spike - ignore it at your peril.
Reddit likes to think of itself as different. 
At its heart, it certainly feels more alternative.
Its system of upvoting content mean ideas either fly or die. 
It's not called the front page of the internet for nothing. 
Mr Huffman has also had to deal with another big story this year  - conspiracy theories peddled by Donald Trump about electoral fraud. 
""What do you do when the president doesn't live up to the ideals, like the principles of our country?"" Mr Huffman said. 
An influential sub-Reddit called TheDonald was instrumental in hyping up Mr Trump across the internet. 
Reddit banned it last year. 
Mr Huffman told BBC News it was the most difficult moderation decision he had had to make.
Huffman is one of handful of men in Silicon Valley - along with Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg - that make huge decisions on what we can and can't see on the internet.

Watch: WallStreetBets is Reddit boss's ""guilty pleasure""
The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.
When did you first come across WallStreetBets?
So I've known about WallStreetBets for years. 
WallStreetBets is, in fact, one of my guilty pleasures on Reddit. 
How much was the group about having a laugh?
A lot of it, as I think it's the cornerstone to a lot of friendship and human experience. 
At the end of the day, this community is fun and it's funny. 
And obviously, there's some cohesion there, talking about the trades. 
When did you start realising WallStreetBets was having an impact on GameStop's share price?
So I think I was actually a little late to this, because I've been on WallStreetBets for a while. 
And they've been talking about GameStop for a while. 
And so on WallStreetBets, there's often a couple of stocks or companies or positions that have their attention. 
And so over the years, it's been Tesla. 
It's been Virgin Galactic. 
It's been Blackberry.
It's been different things. 
And so, in my mind, I'm just browsing Reddit and OK, yeah, GameStop's got their infatuation right now. 
So I was actually a little late to the party, because I didn't realise that Reddit had leaked into the real world again. 
And so it was, I think, really at the the take off of the mania when I was like: ""OK, this is a bigger one.""
This video can not be played
Watch: What's been going on at GameStop?
Then there was that crazy period where the GameStop share price went from $20 to $400. What was going through your mind at that point?
You know, I love reading business stories.
I love reading books about investors and their successes and failures. 
So it's just a topic I'm interested in. 
I just thought it was a fascinating story.
And it's such a smart thing to do.
And I, personally, have found it a fair thing to do. 
So you were always supportive, like ideologically, of what the group was doing?
Yes, because I think if you've got one transaction where one group has taken an extreme position and then another group can see that opportunity that maybe they've overextended themselves. 
Obviously, there's a lot of risk there. 
But I think everybody goes in that situation aware of that risk. 
The shares at one point got almost up to $500 a share. At that point, was there any pressure on you to maybe lock down WallStreetBets?
We faced that question, like that literal question: ""Should you do something?""
But our motivation, or what we were trying to do in that situation, was actually the opposite - to keep WallStreetBets online.
So you decided: ""This needs to stay up""?
The question of should it go down or not was a very fast conversation.
And we were, you know, confident that that community was well moderated and well within our content policy. 
Are you proud of what WallStreetBets managed to achieve?
I am always, I think, proud when people do amazing things. 
And so I think maybe pride isn't even the right word. 
I think I'm happy or encouraged when humans come together to do something incredible. 
Do you think that it was a David-and-Goliath story?
Oh, absolutely, because, you know, institutional investors have so much.
There's so many more resources in terms of knowledge, relationships, the ability to execute large trades.
No individual could have done this. 
Although hedge funds wage war on each other all the time, we never see it. 
And so to see a group of individuals kind of band together against some really well resourced institutions, I think that's an intriguing story from any angle.
Some people lost a lot of money. Do you feel any responsibility? 
I think any trade, not just risky ones like WallStreetBets, has risk. 
But it also has opportunity. 
I think there are two things that are really important. 
One is that individuals have that opportunity. 
I don't think we as a society should be so paternal to say that, well: ""This group is smart enough to make these decisions - but this group, you know, we should keep them out,"" because you're not just protecting them from risk, you're eliminating their participation in the gains. 
Did the Capitol Hill riots make you reappraise the inherent goodness of the free internet?
I'd be lying if I say that thought hadn't crossed my mind.
But we've seen, I think, on Reddit, the power of people to do, I think, the right thing generally.
One of the ways we look at Reddit, one of our duties, is to make sure the volume of any particular viewpoint is in proportion to the number of people who actually have it. 
And so that is to say we don't want a small number of loud people to have control beyond their numbers. 
And I think on Reddit we've gotten pretty good at that. 
I suppose you're wrestling with two things here. You don't want to get involved in censoring or overly censoring people?
We feel, I think, there's an enormous responsibility for getting that balance right. 
And, you know, we are learning, 
I think, along with everybody else, we do our very best because it's not just the right thing to do for our business - it's the right thing to do for our users. 
And I think it's the right thing to do generally.
And, for example, the QAnon conspiracy theory, we saw that on Reddit and banned it three years ago, long before it metastasized online and in the real world. 
Do you think you should have done more on TheDonald? That's one of the criticisms of Reddit that comes up a few times. 
Look, TheDonald was a series of hard decisions. 
And there's never a hard decision that I don't, upon reflection, wish we had made faster. 
But I think there's a matter of reality here - the principle of free speech was designed specifically to protect political speech. 
And so we went through a crisis not just at Reddit but in the United States and, I think, around the world of what do you do when the president doesn't live up to the ideals, like the principles of our country. 
That's a real conflict. 
And so I think there's no way around that conflict.
Is that the most difficult decision that you've had to make?
I think it might be, yes, because the other ones were more matters of getting the words right. 
Other policy changes we've made over the years around, you know, violence or harassment or bullying or involuntary sexualisation, we always knew what our gut told us - what the right thing was. 
And so those were sometimes complicated because we had to figure out how to get there and how to kind of balance all of our values. 
But we always knew where we wanted to go. 
I think with political speech, and in this particular moment, it was particularly challenging given the context of, like, the United States and the president of the United States being almost in conflict with each other.
Fake news, conspiracy theories, how do you stay on top of it? 
Misinformation is another word for propaganda. 
And propaganda is as old as politics. 
This is not a new problem. 
And so, we've faced this problem in different forms over pretty much our entire existence. 
And so the solution, that we've seen, ultimately lies within people. 
It lies within a free press. 
It lies within access to information.
It lies within people being allowed to have good judgements and societal pressure to to be truthful, to behave well, all of these things. 
Finally, there are some pretty niche sub-Reddits. What are the oddest ones you've come across?
Oh, my goodness. 
BreadStapledToTrees is probably the weirdest one that I'm comfortable saying in an interview. 
And it's as the name implies.
It's literally pictures of bread stapled to trees. 
There's another, I think, favourite around the office, CatStandingUp, which is just pictures of cats standing up. 
But that one is very strictly moderated. 
So every comment within every post in that community has to be the single word ""Cat"".

GameStop: Reddit users investing in gorilla conservation,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56438230,"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"""Apes Together Strong"" is a popular saying in Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, and some users are taking that seriously.
Reddit users have been symbolically adopting apes and donating to foundations including The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, external and the World Wildlife Fund. 
Some users are naming GameStop, or GME as they're known on the New York Stock Exchange, as the adopter.
Donations have exceeded $350,000 (£250,000) in less than a week.
The foundation tweeted that the funds will go towards their field programmes where they track, monitor and study gorillas in their natural habitats.

The Fossey Fund said they were ""surprised, thrilled and appreciative of the grassroots donations that have come our way thanks to a group of investors on Reddit."" 
""We thank these new donors for their contributions to the success of our mission - because in saving gorillas, we save the planet.""
The Fossey Fund has also added ""Apes Together Strong"" to their website.
The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund has added WallStreetBet's phrase ""Apes Together Strong"" to their homepage after receiving a large number of donations from users.
The trend started when the user Pakistani_in_MURICA posted an adoption certificate, external in WallStreetBets on Friday. 
The user had adopted a gorilla named Urungano and listed GameStop as its sponsor.
The post won a bevvy of awards and karma - Reddit's way of liking content - and inspired a number of fellow users to adopt or donate. 
""I have three adopted infant Gorillas now. Sorry but animals are my kryptonite,"" one Redditor commented.
""This is good stuff! Gogo /WSB [WallStreetBets]!! This is the sort of thing that happens when people unaccustomed to having money suddenly get some.""
WallStreetBets made headlines earlier this year when a number of amateur investors from the site bought GameStop stock. 
As a result, GameStop's share price spiked, causing huge losses for some hedge funds that had positions betting against GameStop.
Users on WallStreetBets often refer to themselves as ""apes"".
This baby gorilla was symbolically adopted by a user on WallStreetBets who named GameStop as the sponsor.
The Fossey Fund's website says their conservation work is focused on mountain gorillas in Rwanda and Grauer's gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo. 
Their website lists six gorillas up for adoption - and ranging from $60 (£43) to $150 (£107).

"Reddit investors adopt 3,500 gorillas in six days",https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56416954,"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Around 3,500 gorillas have been adopted by Reddit's WallStreetBets, external (WSB) community in six days.
The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International, a charity for the protection of endangered mountain gorillas, has also received more than $350,000 (£252,000) in donations.
Its president Dr Tara Stoinski has thanked the Reddit community, external for the adoptions. 
She said: ""They've truly made a difference for our world."" 
The subreddit WallStreetBets gained prominence earlier this year after its users invested in the computer game retailer GameStop and boosted the share price.
The idea was that if enough Reddit users bought GameStop shares, they could drive up the price, hurting hedge funds which had bet against the company. Now the community has decided to help apes.
Dr Stoinski's video in which she thanked WSB for their ""incredible support"", was posted on the subreddit and upvoted more than 159,000 times. 
She told BBC News: ""They've truly made a difference for our world and shown what can be accomplished when people come together. When we save gorillas and we save forests, we save our world.""
In a tweet, the charity said: ""In a typical weekend, we might get 20 new adoptions. This weekend, the numbers astonished us. 
""It's safe to say that the investor community on Reddit is not traditionally who we think of as our supporter base. But they definitely surprised and overwhelmed us, external over the weekend.""

Tara Stoinski told the BBC the amount of attention the donations have brought to gorillas has been ""phenomenal""
Devin Owen has adopted two gorillas, external named Twibuke and Iyamarere. 
Devin told BBC News: ""I'm just doing my part as one of many to help a great organisation to help apes. Apes are strong together.""
Twibuke and Iyamarere are the two gorillas adopted by Devin Owen, a member of the WallStreetBets community on Reddit
According to KnowYourMeme, external, WSB types referring to each other as ""apes"" is from the prequel to the Planet of the Apes movies, and the character Caesar's explanation that ""apes together strong"" is a motto which is often repeated in Reddit posts.
However, there's a thread on WSB of some Redditors complaining about the current terminology, external. 
Others claim they call themselves the ""ape gang"" because they think of themselves as being like monkeys pressing buttons on a keyboard to buy stocks. Members also frequently use gorilla emojis in their posts. 
There were around two million members of the community at the start of 2021, increasing to 10 million in March. The ""ape"" term took off with the influx of members, with some Redditors putting the tipping point at around the three million membership.
Adopting gorillas started on Friday, when a member of the WSB community posted, external that they had sent a donation to the Dian Fossey Gorilla fund, which allowed them to adopt their own gorilla. 
The post was upvoted over 112,000 times, with other members of the community following suit to adopt their own gorillas.
This is not the first time members of the subreddit have donated to a cause. 
Previously, people who had gained a lot of money off the back of GameStop had made donations to schools, particularly to buy crayons, external. 
Also, another Redditor bought 100 chicken tenders, external (the running joke being it is a WSB Redditor's favourite food, and 'tendies' is used as a term for the reward/gain from the stock) for their local children's hospital workers with their gains. 
Reddit has quite a history of this. The sub r/HydroHomies - celebrating (drinking) water - often has posts, external up about donations to water charities.

US to seize Top Glove products over labour abuses,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56572815,"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has ordered the seizure of disposable gloves made by Malaysia's Top Glove.  
The order said CBP had sufficient information to believe that Top Glove uses forced labour in the production of disposable gloves.
Top Glove is the world's largest producer of latex gloves, and exports to 195 countries. 
The company has said it has taken extensive actions to improve its labour practices.
Asian investors inspired by GameStop surge

US bans palm oil producer over forced labour
""CBP will not tolerate foreign companies' exploitation of vulnerable workers to sell cheap, unethically-made goods to American consumers,"" said Troy Miller from the CBP. 
The US had already banned products from two of Top Glove's subsidiaries in July, but the new ban extends to all disposable gloves from Top Glove factories in Malaysia. 
In its July finding, CBP accused Top Glove of debt bondage, excessive overtime and abusive working and living conditions. 
Nevertheless, HR Asia recently named the company one of the best companies to work for in Asia in 2020. 
CBP said it had taken steps to ensure the ban would not have a significant impact on total US imports of disposable gloves, which are critical to efforts to contain Covid-19. 
Top Glove has 21,000 employees and makes 96 billion gloves each year. 
The company has factories in Thailand, China and Vietnam, but 41 of its 47 factories are in Malaysia. 
Although Top Glove makes person protective equipment, its was forced to shut more than half of its 28 factories in November after almost 2,500 employees tested positive for coronavirus.
All have since reopened, with additional safety measures in place. 
Top Glove shares fell 5% on the news of the US ban. 
The company's shares surged in late January as retail investors in Asia drew inspiration from the GameStop trading frenzy.
A Reddit forum called BursaBets was set up, describing itself as the ""Malaysian version"" of Wallstreetbets, the Reddit forum that helped fuel the GameStop craze. 
Unlike many of the US companies which saw a surge of interest from retail investors, Top Glove is a profitable company. 
The group had its strongest ever sales, with revenue of $1.3bn in its most recent quarterly results. 
The company has applied for an additional listing on Hong Kong's stock exchange.

'Thrill of investing' leads young to take risks,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56496206,"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Young people are investing in high-risk products for the ""challenge, competition and novelty"" it involves, the City regulator has said.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) warned they were getting involved in cryptocurrencies and foreign exchange, but could be taking on big risks.
It said they were often more likely to be women, aged under 40 and from a diverse ethnic background.
They were attracted by the ""thrill"", rather than saving for the future.
The FCA commissioned research looking into ""self-directed"" investors - those who trade themselves rather than seeking financial advice.
The study found many investors were willing to ""have a go"", had been tempted by using investment apps, and went with options because they had been ""hyped"" and assumed big name brands were ""safe"".
The FCA has launched a campaign to prevent investment harm, using online advertising, advising people to ask:
Am I comfortable with the level of risk?
Do I fully understand the investment being offered to me?
Am I protected if things go wrong?
Are my investments regulated?
Should I get financial advice?
Sheldon Mills, executive director, consumer and competition at the FCA, said: ""Much of the consumer investments market meets consumers' needs.
""But we are worried that some investors are being tempted, often through online adverts or high-pressure sales tactics, into buying higher-risk products that are very unlikely to be suitable for them.
""This research has helped us better understand what drives and motivates consumers so we can tell them about the risks involved in these investments through our investment harm campaign.
""We want to make sure that we encourage the ability to save and invest for lifetime events, particularly for younger generations, but it is imperative that consumers do so with savings and investment products that have a suitable level of risk for their needs.
""Investors need to be mindful of their overall risk appetite, diversifying their investments and only investing money they can afford to lose in high risk products.""

Warning over 'risky' TikTok trading tips
Becky O'Connor, from investment platform Interactive Investor, said: ""We want young people to invest - in their pensions and for their families' futures. But we want them to think long and hard about it, do their research and take the time and effort to understand things like risk from different types of asset classes.
""Most young people don't have money to burn - so potentially throwing it away on high risk investments is a big waste when there are so many life challenges down the road for them that they might need that cash for.""

AMC cinema chain issues warning to small investors,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57334264,"Thu, 03 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"US cinema chain AMC has put out a blunt warning to smaller investors as it launched a new share sale.
It warned against buying ""unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.""
On Thursday it unveiled plans to sell up to 11.6 million shares off the back of surging prices in the ""meme"" stock popularised on social media.
AMC stock was lower by more than 20% at the end of Thursday's trading.
It comes a day after the company updated its offer for retail investors, who can now claim a tub of free popcorn if they sign up to a regular newsletter.
A number of Wall Street analysts have said AMC is already heavily overvalued and many institutional traders have said they were steering clear of the stock, the latest target of a number of small-time traders organised on Reddit and other social media.
AMC cinema shares surge in 'frantic' trading
On Thursday, it said in a filing that it would sell up to 11.55 million shares of common stock, with money raised going towards ""general corporate purposes,"" which could cover paying off current debts or buying new cinemas. Its shares fell after the announcement.
This marks its second share sale in three days, having raised $230.5m (£163.3m) by selling 8.5 million new shares to the hedge fund Mudrick Capital Management, which later sold those shares at a profit.
The cinema chain operator said it believed current prices reflected ""market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business"".
In the year to date, shares in AMC have soared 2,421% - despite its cinemas being largely shut during the pandemic.
But it is the latest example of small investors trying to seize power from Wall Street giants. 
Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop and AMC's shares would fall. 
They have since faced huge losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites like Reddit or Twitter, drove prices up in so-called ""meme"" stocks.
AMC said on Thursday that it did not know ""how long these dynamics will last.
""Under the circumstances, we caution you against investing in our Class A common stock, unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment,"" it said.
GameStop sales struggle after trading frenzy
Why the GameStop story is far from over
Analysts have also warned that the stock may be overvalued due to the rise of streaming and competition from other entertainment companies.
David Trainer, chief executive of investment research firm New Constructs, said: ""AMC's business was trending in the wrong direction even prior to the Covid-19 pandemic... We think AMC's stock is worth $0 per share, given its weak earnings, dilution from recent stock offerings and mountain of debt.""
Despite that, AMC has been among the biggest winners from a spike of interest in meme stocks, fuelled in part by a new generation of social media-centric small traders.
On Wednesday, #AMCstock was trending on Twitter in the US as investors discussed their holdings and the share price nearly doubled.
The Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Gary Gensler said at a hearing last month that it will report on issues around volatile ""meme"" stocks this summer.
He said that although online forums such as Reddit can serve as a ""real community"", he is concerned about ""the risks that nefarious actors may try to send signals to manipulate the market"".

"Tesla failed to stop Musk tweets, says regulator",https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57332399,"Wed, 02 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Tesla has allegedly repeatedly failed to pre-approve Elon Musk's tweets, despite the rules of a court order. 
In 2018, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) accused Mr Musk of misleading investors, after he made claims about taking Tesla private. 
An agreement was made requiring Tesla's lawyers to pre-approve certain tweets. 
But documents obtained by the Wall Street Journal suggest the regulator believes Mr Musk and Tesla have broken the terms of that deal.
According to the newspaper, external, the SEC wrote to Tesla alleging that Elon Musk's Twitter account had violated the deal twice.
One tweet made claims about Tesla's stock price ""being too high"", while the other made claims regarding the company's solar roof production. 
One of the terms of the settlement was that Tesla's lawyers must pre-approve tweets that relate to things such as production numbers, new products and the company's finances. 
Elon Musk tweet wipes $14bn off Tesla's value
Musk reaches deal over tweets
When Elon Musk was reprimanded by the SEC in 2018 and forced to submit sensitive tweets to Tesla's lawyers in future, did anyone think that would really work? 
The man who had tweeted: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured""  - without having that funding tied down - seemed unlikely to change his spots. And so it has proved.
The tycoon has in fact become even more incontinent and prolific in his tweeting, whether it is raging about the Californian authorities for wanting to shut his factory at the beginning of the pandemic, propelling shares in Gamestop higher amid the speculative frenzy around the company, or helping turn Dogecoin from a joke into a crypto-currency success story.
To be fair, he has been more careful in his tweets about his own companies, though predictions about Tesla's self-driving capabilities or the progress of his brain interface project Neuralink may have raised eyebrows. 
But it's the Musk effect - the fact that any tweet about a quoted company or crypto-currency can send its value soaring - which must worry the SEC.
Short of ordering the volatile entrepreneur to close his Twitter  account, however, it's not clear what the watchdog can do. 
Tesla told the SEC it believed Mr Musk's contentious tweets were not covered by the agreement, since they were ""aspirational"" or opinion, the Journal reported, citing documents obtained using a Freedom of Information request.
The SEC disagreed, the newspaper's documents show.
""In the face of Mr Musk's repeated refusals to submit his covered written communications on Twitter to Tesla for pre-approval, we are very concerned,"" the SEC wrote.
It urged the company to ""reconsider its position"" and enforce controls and procedures ""to prevent further shareholder harm"".
Following accusations of misleading investors in 2018, Mr Musk was forced to resign as chairman of Tesla as a result, and he was fined $20m (£14.1m). 
Mr Musk did not admit any wrongdoing. 
In an interview with news channel CBS at the time, he said he had ""no respect"" for the SEC, but he had chosen to pay the settlement fine because he believed in the justice system.

Donald Trump calls Bitcoin 'a scam against the dollar',https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57392734,"Mon, 07 Jun 2021 07:00:00 GMT",BBC.com,"Former US President Donald Trump has told Fox Business that he sees Bitcoin as a ""scam"" affecting the value of the US dollar.
""Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam,"" Mr Trump said. ""I don't like it because it's another currency competing against the dollar.""
He added that he wanted the dollar to be ""the currency of the world"".
His comments come on the back of news El Salvador plans to make the crypto-currency legal tender. 
The price of Bitcoin has been falling steadily since early May and so far has not recovered.
The falls were widely attributed to China banning banned banks and payment firms from providing services related to crypto-currency transactions, as well as electric car maker Tesla announcing it would no longer accept the currency a week before that. 
Is Bitcoin actually a threat to currency? Here's what experts we spoke to think.
Justin Urquhart-Stewart, co-founder of Seven Investment Management and the Regionally investment platform, thinks Bitcoin does have a potential threat of destabilising currencies ""because it has taken off in such a way that it's created a popular appeal without any sound financial strength"".
People enjoy themselves at the Bitcoin 2021 Convention, a crypto-currency conference in Miami this week
He blames the rise of Bitcoin on figures like Elon Musk ""behaving stupidly"", which makes the general public perceive that the crypto-currency is credible.
""Bitcoin is dangerous because it's trying to create a level of credibility to unreliable and wholly unfounded value,"" he tells the BBC. 
""Quite often, unsophisticated punters are drawn in at the wrong time to something they think they can make a quick buck on - to them, it doesn't matter what it is, whether it's Bitcoin or GameStop or AMC, it's something you can bet on.""

He says that a rising trend of young people who are somewhat tech savvy, ""like hobby technologists"", are taking huge risks because they haven't been educated about finance properly.
Mr Urquhart-Stewart strongly believes the national curriculum should include education on how to develop family finances over generations.
""What we have now is a young generation of punters who have no knowledge of financial planning and development,"" stresses Mr Urquhart-Stewart.
""They understand how to buy and sell things, but they have no concept of how to create longer-term wealth.""
In contrast, Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, thinks Bitcoin is definitely not a currency. 
Mr Wilson says that Bitcoin could pose a slight threat to gold, as people are moving their investment allocations away from precious metals, into crypto-currency
He says that to qualify as a currency, it must have the following functions:
A unit of account
Provide a good store of value
Be a means of payment 
""I call Bitcoin more of a security, like a stock or bond,"" says Mr Wilson. 
""Although it's appreciated massively, it's far too volatile to be a currency - it moves around more than most stocks do.""
He says that with Bitcoin, people are mostly buying it to hold onto and invest, rather than spending it frequently.
And as to Mr Trump's assertion that the crypto-currency is threatening the US dollar, he disagrees, although it could be a slight threat to gold. 
""The means by which America exerts influence over the world is predominantly by the dollar, and it's not going to give that up, so I don't see Bitcoin as a threat whatsoever,"" he says.
""Governments don't like other people creating money - they've seemed to tolerate crypto-currencies for some time, but they will eventually get their own digital currencies established and will squeeze Bitcoin out into the margins.""
