That year, Angelenos filled the streets, joining worldwide protests after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The mood was ripe for change, and a ballot initiative known as Measure J passed with 57 percent support, amending the LA County charter so that jailing people before trial would be treated as a last resort. Ten percent of the county\\u2019s general fund would be allocated to community-led alternatives to incarceration that prioritized diversion, job training, and health programs.\\nBut years later, as Measure J finally, slowly, gets implemented, advocates say that changes meant to divert money from law enforcement might instead just funnel it back to them.\\nCase in point: In June, LA County signed over the handling of changes to pretrial detention under Measure J to the consulting firm Accenture, a behemoth in the world of biometric databases and predictive policing. Accenture has led the development of \\u201cintelligent public safety\\u201d platforms and tech-enabled risk assessment tools for national security and law enforcement agencies in the United States and around the world, including in Israel and India. An Accenture advisory panel working on the Measure J implementation includes former federal and local law enforcement agents.\\nAccenture\\u2019s role was further publicized Monday after Civil Rights Corps, a nonprofit focused on injustice in the legal system, sent a letter to the LA County Board of Supervisors calling on them to immediately cancel the company\\u2019s contract. The contract takes the county away from its stated vision for a \\u201ccare first, jails last\\u201d approach and toward carceral policies, CRC wrote in the letter. \\u201cAlready, Accenture has concluded that electronic monitoring is a \\u2018favorable alternative\\u2019 to incarceration, ignoring the reality that electronic monitoring is expensive, unsupported by social science, and demonstrably racially biased as applied in Los Angeles,\\u201d the letter adds. \\u201cThis is unsurprising: the consultants working on the Contract have deep ties to police departments and prisons.\\u201d\\nMeasure J was one of at least 20 local criminal justice reform efforts that passed nationwide in the six months after Floyd\\u2019s murder. It was also part of a string of major wins by advocates in Los Angeles, who had been pushing alternatives to incarceration and investment in social services long before 2020.\\nMeasure J ran into predictable opposition: A group including the union for Los Angeles sheriff\\u2019s deputies sued to block the measure and delayed it from going into effect in 2021, but it was put back on track after a judge upheld it on appeal last year. Nationally, despite widespread support, the criminal justice reform wave was met by a well-funded and bipartisan opposition led by police, sheriffs, and conservative Republicans and Democrats who fearmongered about rising crime. In the years since the 2020 uprisings, efforts to reallocate police funding, implement federal and local police reforms, and invest in social services have been undone or derailed. Many of those who cheered the reform movement are frustrated that they haven\\u2019t seen the impact of so many policy wins. Accenture\\u2019s contract for Measure J shows another reason why.\\nCriminal justice reforms are \\u201cbeing cannibalized,\\u201d said Matyos Kidane, an organizer with the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, an abolitionist community group based in Skid Row. Kidane said the group organizes against reforms because of the way corporations and law enforcement groups exploit and defang such initiatives. He pointed to Axon, which has profited massively from the push to get police equipped with body cameras.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a golden opportunity for them,\\u201d Kidane said. When Measure J passed, \\u201cAccenture was ready to go once this opportunity presented itself.\\u201d\\nAccenture has not publicly announced the contract with Los Angeles County, which was signed in June 2023 without a competitive bidding process for a total of $8.6 million over two and a half years. The contract exceeded the $200,000 limit in state law and county charter for a sole-source contract, and the board of supervisors created a motion to allow the requirement to be skirted in order to implement Measure J. But that motion allowed for a contract of up to $3 million, far less than the final signing price. The county told The Intercept it had paid $2 million to Accenture so far. (The supervisors who signed the motion did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\\n\\u201cEven if it were entered into legally \\u2014 which it was not \\u2014 the Contract is duplicative, wasteful, and harmful to Los Angeles and should be canceled on policy grounds alone,\\u201d the Civil Rights Corp letter states.\\nIn presentations made in August to the Los Angeles Justice, Care, and Opportunities Department, which is administering the contract (published in September by the accountability group Expose Accenture) the firm gave an overview of its project timeline and plans to engage stakeholders in focus groups, interviews, workshops, and site visits. The firm highlighted targets for \\u201cquick wins\\u201d by October 1, 2023, such as creating a county website and launching marketing and communications for \\u201cJustice Involved Individuals\\u201d (i.e., people who have been arrested) and summarized top lines of conversations with 50 such people, including the observation that there was wide support for electronic monitoring as an alternative to custody.\\nA spokesperson for the county CEO, which controls county budget decisions, directed questions about the CRC letter to JCOD, as did Accenture. Department spokesperson Avi Bernard did not answer specific questions about how the county raised the limit for the contract but told The Intercept that JCOD had used approved county procedures and consulted with county counsel throughout the contract process. Bernard said CRC had previously raised similar concerns. \\u201cCounty Counsel and Board reviewed these concerns and found no issues with continuing the contract,\\u201d Bernard said. He added that there had been \\u201cno conversations with Accenture\\u201d and JCOD related to the use of electronic monitoring.\\nBernard said that so far, Accenture had designed an independent pretrial services agency for the county, incorporated input from stakeholders, and supported a hotline, website, and marketing campaign. Bernard said the firm has now deployed a three-person implementation team to launch the independent pretrial services agency and is helping JCOD develop a case management IT system.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s talking left while running off with the profiteers of mass surveillance and detention.\\u201d\\nThe fact that Accenture was even an option for implementing Measure J came as a shock to many of its supporters, who had watched the county meet with community partners interested in helping carry out its implementation. The contract was also news to some county supervisors, according to advocates with knowledge of the contract process.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s worse than talk left, walk right politics,\\u201d said Nika Soon-Shiong, founder and executive director at the Fund for Guaranteed Income and a Ph.D. researcher on digital identification systems. \\u201cIt\\u2019s talking left while running off with the profiteers of mass surveillance and detention.\\u201d\\nAccenture has pushed counterterror and policing strategies around the globe: The company built the world\\u2019s biggest biometric identification system in India, which has used similar technologies to surveil protesters and conduct crowd control as part of efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party to investigate the citizenship of Muslim residents. And in Israel, Accenture acquired the cybersecurity firm Maglan in 2016 and has worked to facilitate collaboration between India and Israel aimed at \\u201cfostering inclusive economic growth and maximizing human potential.\\u201d\\nAccenture ballooned into a giant in federal consulting over the course of the \\u201cwar on terror,\\u201d winning hundreds of millions of dollars in lucrative contracts from federal agencies like the Department of Homeland Security for projects from a \\u201cvirtual border\\u201d to recruiting and hiring Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol agents. In 2006, Accenture won a $10 million contract for a DHS biometric ID program, the world\\u2019s second biggest, to collect and share biometric data on foreign nationals entering or leaving the U.S. The company has also worked with police departments in Seattle and in the United Kingdom. Jimmy Etheredge, Accenture\\u2019s former CEO for North America, sits on the board of the Atlanta Police Foundation.\\nAsked about Accenture\\u2019s international work on biometric identification, predictive policing, and national security, Bernard, the JCOD spokesperson, said the firm was involved in many different kinds of work. \\u201cAccenture is a large, international consulting firm with many lines of business. The specific consultants assigned to this project are part of a team in Accenture dedicated to the public sector. Their team comes from a variety of backgrounds, primarily in the health and human services industry.\\u201d\\nBut several LA-based advocates told The Intercept that the contract is yet another development that calls into question the county\\u2019s commitment to real criminal justice reform. The county has missed all of its deadlines for a plan to close the notoriously inhumane Men\\u2019s Central Jail, even as deaths in custody continue apace. In August, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\\u2019s Department issued a Request for Information for a biometric identification system.\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m genuinely confused about how we ended up with this Accenture contract, especially as someone who participated in the development of the Care First, Jails Last (ATI) report,\\u201d said Danielle Dupuy-Watson, CEO of CRC, referring to an \\u201cAlternatives to Incarceration\\u201d working group commissioned by the county. \\u201cWe hoped for transparency and accountability but instead we were gaslit.\\u201d\\nBehind-the-scenes deals like the one with Accenture are one reason that popular reforms haven\\u2019t come to fruition, said Lex Steppling, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network.\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s the performance of democracy on the front end where a policy gets pressured into place, and on the back end there\\u2019s no governance.\\u201d\\n\\u201cPeople vote in that direction, and then it doesn\\u2019t happen. And they chalk it up to, \\u2018Well, politicians ain\\u2019t shit,\\u2019\\u201d Steppling said. People assume, he added, that when policy is passed, bureaucrats work out its implementation. \\u201cWhat we\\u2019re learning is there\\u2019s the performance of democracy on the front end where a policy gets pressured into place, and on the back end there\\u2019s no governance.

This compares to its plan to hire around 1,000 talent for its Thailand centre that it announced in Nov 2021. Thailand\\u2019s population is just under 70 million or 2.1 times larger than Malaysia\\u2019s 33 million.\\nAccenture paints the hiring target as representing a major step in supporting Malaysia\\u2019s digital economy blueprint, MyDigital, introduced in Feb 2021, with the aim of creating 500,000 jobs in the digital economy.\\nAzwan Baharuddin (pic), country managing director said, \\u201cWe are confident the Accenture Advanced Technology Centre in Malaysia will contribute to the country's key growth priorities by training and activating local technology talent.\\u201d\\nWith its priority on cloud, analytics, Intelligent Platform Services, Security and AI technologies, Azwan believes this affords talent at the ATCM an exciting opportunity to apply and deepen their skills through their work for local and global clients. His lofty goal is for the ATCM to become, no less than \\u201cSoutheast Asia\\u2019s powerhouse of technology.\\u201d\\nBut first he has to attract the talent, and Accenture Malaysia, despite being a Tier 1 employer, is not known to be a magnet for top tech talent, notes an ivy league educated software architect running a consultancy in Kuala Lumpur.\\nFocusing on locals when tech talent is seeing its strongest demand yet\\nBe that as it may, Azwan and Accenture Malaysia have a bigger challenge. The pandemic has shown even more clearly that tech talent and many tech roles to be both global and mobile, and paradoxically, keyboard and connectivity bound rather than by physicality. You could be working for Azwan, sitting on a beach, in Zanzibar Island. You just need your trusty laptop and a solid 4G mobile service. Fixed broadband would be a bonus.\\nBut then, you could also decide that it would be more fun earning in US currency, from that same beach. Online ads touting full time, high paying, software jobs in the US, abound with the added allure \\u2013 No visa, No suitcase needed.\\nDespite this new reality of tech work, Accenture Malaysia and Azwan have given themselves a bigger challenge than just hiring over 2,000 technically competent talent for the ATCM.\\nThey want to hire Malaysian talent, as far as possible. That means they have to not just compete aggressively but also spread their recruitment dragnet far and wide, into every nook and cranny in Malaysia if they can. Just waiting in a 5-star hotel in Kuala Lumpur during a career fair or even embarking on a major cities/university recruitment tour, is not going to cut it anymore.\\nWith necessity being the mother of invention, what Accenture has done is to flip the recruitment model. Instead of hoping candidates want to join its ATCM and filtering the applicants down to those it deems are good enough for consideration with an invite to the face to face or video interview, it is relying on the metaverse to show candidates the cool and exciting careers and work they can be a part of at Accenture Malaysia. This includes meeting and talking to existing Accenture staff as well, to get a sense of the actual work and company culture.\\nEnter the Accenture Careerverse\\n\\u201cWe are going to where the talent is,\\u201d declared Azwan at a briefing on Monday about the Accenture Careerverse that it officially launched today, April 22. \\u201cThink of it as a sort of The Matrix meets Ready Player One,\\u201d he quips.\\nOffering a more prosaic view, Ramakrishnan C. N, managing director and Head of Entropia Extended Reality, describes the Careerverse as a future window into what career fairs will likely look and feel like, with Accenture Malaysia determined to lead the way.\\nDeveloped by Entropia Extended Reality, a Malaysian creative and digital agency that Accenture acquired in June 2021, the current Careerverse is designed to be a browser-based \\u2018light\\u2019 and easily accessible web VR experience without the need for a US$400 (RM1,715) immersive experience VR set or the need for strong connectivity as a threshold.\\nThe second version will be built with higher personalisation which includes visitors using their own avatars but for now, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t want it to be too heavy to ensure a smooth user experience,\\u201d said Azwan.\\nAs if to emphasise the importance for such an approach, Azwan himself had connectivity issues with lag interfering during his comments.\\nThe objective now is for talent sitting in Bario, Sarawak, or sitting in a caf\\u00e9 at KLCC, to a recently graduated student back home in Kuala Trengganu helping her father sort the daily catch by the beach, to all have as smooth an experience in the Accenture Careerverse.\\nDespite the hype around the metaverse and Accenture\\u2019s bullishness over the impact it will have in the business world, Ramakrishnan points out that the building blocks are still taking shape and \\u201cShould coalesce over the next 10 years for greater business use.\\u201d\\nThat rising demand from business will mean more roles for the technologists building out those future metaverse worlds. Anticipating this demand, Accenture Malaysia is hoping its Careerverse will attract the right talent to it from which Azwan can try to fill the over 2,000 roles at the ATCM.\\n\\u201cTalent participating in the Accenture Careerverse, will get a glimpse of the work that awaits them, and the skills development journey tailored to their specialisations. These include providing learning milestones from their very first month with us, and beyond, leading to specific technology certifications,\\u201d said Nicole Lee (pic), managing director, Accenture Malaysia\\u2019s Technology Lead.\\nIt\\u2019s a bold attempt by Accenture Malaysia and it\\u2019s also the first such attempt by Accenture globally, says Azwan who is not touting the fact, being more focused on ensuring it delivers the right impact to the talent pool he aims to attract to the ATCM. Bragging rights can come later.\\nTechnology talent can register for the Accenture Careerverse here.\",\n          \"Biometrics Giant Accenture Quietly Took Over LA Residents\\u2019 Jail Reform Plan In November 2020, Los Angeles voters moved to radically transform the way the county handled incarceration. That year, Angelenos filled the streets, joining worldwide protests after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The mood was ripe for change, and a ballot initiative known as Measure J passed with 57 percent support, amending the LA County charter so that jailing people before trial would be treated as a last resort. Ten percent of the county\\u2019s general fund would be allocated to community-led alternatives to incarceration that prioritized diversion, job training, and health programs.\\nBut years later, as Measure J finally, slowly, gets implemented, advocates say that changes meant to divert money from law enforcement might instead just funnel it back to them.\\nCase in point: In June, LA County signed over the handling of changes to pretrial detention under Measure J to the consulting firm Accenture, a behemoth in the world of biometric databases and predictive policing. Accenture has led the development of \\u201cintelligent public safety\\u201d platforms and tech-enabled risk assessment tools for national security and law enforcement agencies in the United States and around the world, including in Israel and India. An Accenture advisory panel working on the Measure J implementation includes former federal and local law enforcement agents.\\nAccenture\\u2019s role was further publicized Monday after Civil Rights Corps, a nonprofit focused on injustice in the legal system, sent a letter to the LA County Board of Supervisors calling on them to immediately cancel the company\\u2019s contract. The contract takes the county away from its stated vision for a \\u201ccare first, jails last\\u201d approach and toward carceral policies, CRC wrote in the letter. \\u201cAlready, Accenture has concluded that electronic monitoring is a \\u2018favorable alternative\\u2019 to incarceration, ignoring the reality that electronic monitoring is expensive, unsupported by social science, and demonstrably racially biased as applied in Los Angeles,\\u201d the letter adds. \\u201cThis is unsurprising: the consultants working on the Contract have deep ties to police departments and prisons.\\u201d\\nMeasure J was one of at least 20 local criminal justice reform efforts that passed nationwide in the six months after Floyd\\u2019s murder. It was also part of a string of major wins by advocates in Los Angeles, who had been pushing alternatives to incarceration and investment in social services long before 2020.\\nMeasure J ran into predictable opposition: A group including the union for Los Angeles sheriff\\u2019s deputies sued to block the measure and delayed it from going into effect in 2021, but it was put back on track after a judge upheld it on appeal last year. Nationally, despite widespread support, the criminal justice reform wave was met by a well-funded and bipartisan opposition led by police, sheriffs, and conservative Republicans and Democrats who fearmongered about rising crime. In the years since the 2020 uprisings, efforts to reallocate police funding, implement federal and local police reforms, and invest in social services have been undone or derailed. Many of those who cheered the reform movement are frustrated that they haven\\u2019t seen the impact of so many policy wins. Accenture\\u2019s contract for Measure J shows another reason why.\\nCriminal justice reforms are \\u201cbeing cannibalized,\\u201d said Matyos Kidane, an organizer with the Stop LAPD Spying Coalition, an abolitionist community group based in Skid Row. Kidane said the group organizes against reforms because of the way corporations and law enforcement groups exploit and defang such initiatives. He pointed to Axon, which has profited massively from the push to get police equipped with body cameras.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a golden opportunity for them,\\u201d Kidane said. When Measure J passed, \\u201cAccenture was ready to go once this opportunity presented itself.\\u201d\\nAccenture has not publicly announced the contract with Los Angeles County, which was signed in June 2023 without a competitive bidding process for a total of $8.6 million over two and a half years. The contract exceeded the $200,000 limit in state law and county charter for a sole-source contract, and the board of supervisors created a motion to allow the requirement to be skirted in order to implement Measure J. But that motion allowed for a contract of up to $3 million, far less than the final signing price. The county told The Intercept it had paid $2 million to Accenture so far. (The supervisors who signed the motion did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\\n\\u201cEven if it were entered into legally \\u2014 which it was not \\u2014 the Contract is duplicative, wasteful, and harmful to Los Angeles and should be canceled on policy grounds alone,\\u201d the Civil Rights Corp letter states.\\nIn presentations made in August to the Los Angeles Justice, Care, and Opportunities Department, which is administering the contract (published in September by the accountability group Expose Accenture) the firm gave an overview of its project timeline and plans to engage stakeholders in focus groups, interviews, workshops, and site visits. The firm highlighted targets for \\u201cquick wins\\u201d by October 1, 2023, such as creating a county website and launching marketing and communications for \\u201cJustice Involved Individuals\\u201d (i.e., people who have been arrested) and summarized top lines of conversations with 50 such people, including the observation that there was wide support for electronic monitoring as an alternative to custody.\\nA spokesperson for the county CEO, which controls county budget decisions, directed questions about the CRC letter to JCOD, as did Accenture. Department spokesperson Avi Bernard did not answer specific questions about how the county raised the limit for the contract but told The Intercept that JCOD had used approved county procedures and consulted with county counsel throughout the contract process. Bernard said CRC had previously raised similar concerns. \\u201cCounty Counsel and Board reviewed these concerns and found no issues with continuing the contract,\\u201d Bernard said. He added that there had been \\u201cno conversations with Accenture\\u201d and JCOD related to the use of electronic monitoring.\\nBernard said that so far, Accenture had designed an independent pretrial services agency for the county, incorporated input from stakeholders, and supported a hotline, website, and marketing campaign. Bernard said the firm has now deployed a three-person implementation team to launch the independent pretrial services agency and is helping JCOD develop a case management IT system.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s talking left while running off with the profiteers of mass surveillance and detention.\\u201d\\nThe fact that Accenture was even an option for implementing Measure J came as a shock to many of its supporters, who had watched the county meet with community partners interested in helping carry out its implementation. The contract was also news to some county supervisors, according to advocates with knowledge of the contract process.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s worse than talk left, walk right politics,\\u201d said Nika Soon-Shiong, founder and executive director at the Fund for Guaranteed Income and a Ph.D. researcher on digital identification systems. \\u201cIt\\u2019s talking left while running off with the profiteers of mass surveillance and detention.\\u201d\\nAccenture has pushed counterterror and policing strategies around the globe: The company built the world\\u2019s biggest biometric identification system in India, which has used similar technologies to surveil protesters and conduct crowd control as part of efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party to investigate the citizenship of Muslim residents. And in Israel, Accenture acquired the cybersecurity firm Maglan in 2016 and has worked to facilitate collaboration between India and Israel aimed at \\u201cfostering inclusive economic growth and maximizing human potential.\\u201d\\nAccenture ballooned into a giant in federal consulting over the course of the \\u201cwar on terror,\\u201d winning hundreds of millions of dollars in lucrative contracts from federal agencies like the Department of Homeland Security for projects from a \\u201cvirtual border\\u201d to recruiting and hiring Customs and Border Protection and Border Patrol agents. In 2006, Accenture won a $10 million contract for a DHS biometric ID program, the world\\u2019s second biggest, to collect and share biometric data on foreign nationals entering or leaving the U.S. The company has also worked with police departments in Seattle and in the United Kingdom. Jimmy Etheredge, Accenture\\u2019s former CEO for North America, sits on the board of the Atlanta Police Foundation.\\nAsked about Accenture\\u2019s international work on biometric identification, predictive policing, and national security, Bernard, the JCOD spokesperson, said the firm was involved in many different kinds of work. \\u201cAccenture is a large, international consulting firm with many lines of business. The specific consultants assigned to this project are part of a team in Accenture dedicated to the public sector. Their team comes from a variety of backgrounds, primarily in the health and human services industry.\\u201d\\nBut several LA-based advocates told The Intercept that the contract is yet another development that calls into question the county\\u2019s commitment to real criminal justice reform. The county has missed all of its deadlines for a plan to close the notoriously inhumane Men\\u2019s Central Jail, even as deaths in custody continue apace. In August, the Los Angeles County Sheriff\\u2019s Department issued a Request for Information for a biometric identification system.\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m genuinely confused about how we ended up with this Accenture contract, especially as someone who participated in the development of the Care First, Jails Last (ATI) report,\\u201d said Danielle Dupuy-Watson, CEO of CRC, referring to an \\u201cAlternatives to Incarceration\\u201d working group commissioned by the county. \\u201cWe hoped for transparency and accountability but instead we were gaslit.\\u201d\\nBehind-the-scenes deals like the one with Accenture are one reason that popular reforms haven\\u2019t come to fruition, said Lex Steppling, an organizer with Los Angeles Community Action Network.\\n\\u201cThere\\u2019s the performance of democracy on the front end where a policy gets pressured into place, and on the back end there\\u2019s no governance.\\u201d\\n\\u201cPeople vote in that direction, and then it doesn\\u2019t happen. And they chalk it up to, \\u2018Well, politicians ain\\u2019t shit,\\u2019\\u201d Steppling said. People assume, he added, that when policy is passed, bureaucrats work out its implementation. \\u201cWhat we\\u2019re learning is there\\u2019s the performance of democracy on the front end where a policy gets pressured into place, and on the back end there\\u2019s no governance. It just simply gets procured and contracted away to these consulting firms.\\u201d\\nThat the county took a historic progressive reform and contracted it out to a firm that put the community\\u2019s plans back into the hands of law enforcement is a perfect expression of the problem, Steppling said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no democracy there.
